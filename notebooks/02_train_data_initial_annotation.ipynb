It was also from the British Embassy (Bayt al Lourd) on Ahmed Ragab Street that in 1942 the British Envoy Sir Miles Lampson drove in a military cortege to the Palace of Abdeen to give the then King Farouk a choice of appointing a pro-British cabinet or abdicate.

       " {'document': 'Don\\'t be confused by the red neon sign in the window that says \"PSYCHIC READINGS\" — this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor isn\\'t that kind of gypsy parlor! Owned by Gabrielle Mattina and named and themed in an homage to Gabrielle Mattina\\'s Roma ancestry, this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor serves delicious food in an ambience that\\'s airy yet intimate (reservations are recommended on weekends), comfortable yet garishly decorated. The bulk of the small menu is made up of light fare such as salads and sandwiches; most interestingly, a selection of appetizers dubbed \"West Side Delicacies\" are offered in a nod to the neighborhood\\'s cultural diversity, and the \\'\\'pastelillos\\'\\', samosas and Burmese spring rolls hold the \\'\\'pastelillos\\'\\', samosas and Burmese spring rolls\\'s own with anything that\\'s available at the \\'\\'\\'West Side Bazaar\\'\\'\\'. Really, you won\\'t find anything more substantial at this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor than the pair of half-pound burgers that are among the most popular items on the menu — either \"Classic American\" or \"Black Sheep\", the latter a decidedly upscale concoction of peppercorn-crusted ground lamb topped with a dijon & beet coleslaw. What you \\'\\'will\\'\\' find here is friendly, attentive service and food at a decent price.',\n",
