The statue of Philip III sits in the middle across from the '''Casa de la Panadería''', a beautifully painted building with two towers on the north side of this impressive square (not to be confused with the ''other'' building with two towers on the opposite side) which once served as the headquarters of the bakers' guild and now houses a tourist information office. Access to this impressive square is via one of the many arcades which connect to the surrounding pedestrian streets.\",\n",

Here, Bartolomeo Rastrelli's rejects the cour d'honneur in the French manner. By this time, Bartolomeo Rastrelli's has developed Bartolomeo Rastrelli's's own style based on exploring the impressive façade, which implies the presence of three risolites, the subordination to a single center, rejection of verticalization, and stretching the palace horizontally. Bartolomeo Rastrelli's gives the palace a single mass movement toward the center. Bartolomeo Rastrelli's skillfully emphasizes this by subordinating the lateral risolites to the central, imposing group of columns of purely decorative, not architectonic, function, deliberately building up tension toward the center. Bartolomeo Rastrelli's uses the giant order, the method of visual fusion of the second and third floor windows, typical for the Baroque, and the differentiated arrangement of columns closely adjacent to the wall in order to create a masterful effect and an impressive Baroque façade facing St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. The main façade of the Stroganov palace carries an entrance arch supported by two Corinthian columns. an entrance arch supported by two Corinthian columns is crowned with a pediment bearing the Baron Sergei Grigoriyevich Stroganov coat of arms. The spaces under the windows on The main façade of the Stroganov palace feature a man's profile. There are two practically anecdotal versions regarding a man's's identity. According to one version, a man's is the first owner of the palace, Baron Stroganov, whom Bartolomeo Rastrelli's wanted to surprise. However, many historians claim that Bartolomeo Rastrelli's in fact left Bartolomeo Rastrelli's's own profile on the palace walls.\",\n",

House of Hummus is headed by Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties, and the keys to House of Hummus\\'s greatness are time-tested old-world cooking techniques and flavors that are intricate, well-balanced, and above all, authentic. The menu is not the most extensive in the world, but The menu covers all the bases: the twin centerpieces are the titular chickpea dip (large platters come topped with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and — optionally — shawarma meat) as well as what Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties describes as \"Western New York\\'s fluffiest falafel\" (the fluffiness is due to the absence of pine nuts, and the indelible aroma of fresh parsley elevates the fluffiness a cut above what you can get elsewhere in Buffalo). For main courses, chicken and beef shawarma is the most popular item on the menu, marinated overnight in a mix of red wine, vinegar, olive oil, and a secret blend of spices and topped in a delicious house-special sauce; gyro, shish kebabs, and a variety of salads are also on offer. As you might imagine, vegetarians and vegans will find an uncommonly ample range of choices, and if you\\'re not in the mood for Middle Eastern food, vegetarians and vegans also make a mean Philly cheesesteak. Portions are generous, service is attentive and brimming with old-fashioned friendliness, and House of Hummus is clean but small, with only a few tables in the dining room (thankfully, take-out and delivery are offered).',\n",

Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was the first of Buffalo\\'s\\'s Olmsted parks to open to the public, in 1872: called \"The Parade\" at first, Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was designed to host military drills and other large gatherings, with the brightly colored \\'\\'\\'Parade House\\'\\'\\' as Martin Luther King, Jr. Park\\'s centerpiece and \\'\\'\\'Humboldt Parkway\\'\\'\\', the most magnificent of all the Olmsted parkways in Buffalo\\'s, linking it to the rest of the system. But Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was far from any military installations Buffalo\\'s had; to the consternation of Olmsted, Martin Luther King, Jr. Park instead became a gathering place for the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed his quiet pastoral vision for it\\'s quiet pastoral vision for Martin Luther King, Jr. Park with raucous oompah bands that played at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park and neighborhood scamps damaging the grass with their roughhousing.

Olmsted\\'s two sons, the successors in his firm renamed the park Humboldt Park, a name that was changed yet again in 1977 to the park Humboldt Park\\'s current one. Sadly, like most of the other elements of Buffalo\\'s\\'s park system, the integrity of Olmsted\\'s original design of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park sustained considerable damage over the course of the 20th Century: Martin Luther King, Jr. Park is long-gone, part of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park\\'s west edge was sacrificed in 1929 for the science museum, and there\\'s a basketball court where the Lily Pond used to be.

Black Squirrel Distillery is one of a very few producers of rum in New York State, and the only one in the country that uses maple syrup as the main ingredient rather than cane sugar — a peculiarity that was borne of the requirement that New York-based craft distillers source 75% of New York-based craft distillers\\'s ingredients from within New York State, though no sugarcane is grown that far north. The end result grafts a subtle yet distinctive maple finish onto the flavor of what is otherwise a rather traditional amber rum. All the rums produced by Black Squirrel Distillery are handcrafted in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; distilled in a traditional copper-columned pot still then aged in oak barrels, the old-fashioned way. In the same vein, Black Squirrel Distillery also produces an unaged, 90-proof distilled spirit Black Squirrel Distillery call \"mapleshine\" — essentially what backwoods distillers would call \"sugar shine\", except with maple syrup in place of sugar.

For instance, the popular duck fries appetizer — hand-cut French fries cooked in duck fat — was imported lock, stock and barrel from Elmwood Avenue\\'s, and the several dozen local and regional craft beers available on tap and in bottles mines much the same territory as well.

Featured sausage selections at The old \\'\\'\\'Sterling Place Tavern\\'\\'\\' change periodically, but typically include such offbeat, exotic \"rare game\" blends as wild boar with cranberry and red wine, smoked bison with Burgundy and thyme, and duck with foie gras and Sauterne wine. Elsewhere on the small but impressive menu is a slate of combo platters of locally-produced, somewhat less hoity-toity (but still delicious) \\'\\'\\'Wardynski\\'s\\'\\'\\' sausages with various toppings and sides, a selection of mac & cheese mains with a variety of toppings, and familiar yet well-executed pub grub such as wings, sandwiches, and burgers, the latter of which are especially accoladed.

Going beyond the kitsch factor, it's rather difficult to generalize about the constantly changing lineup of merchandise that passes through Junk & Disorderly's doors, but midcentury vintage knickknacks seem to handily outnumber outright antiques (the cutoff date seems to be around World War II) and specialties seem to include lamps, kitchenware, and above all, a treasure trove of decorative Christmas baubles, vintage ornaments, and other holiday-themed items. But the inventory is a diverse hodgepodge — the owners are known to train the owners's eyes on anything unusual or offbeat, and to travel long distances to do so, with merchandise sourced from estate sales, swap meets, and flea markets across the Northeast. Junk & Disorderly's opening hours aren't what you would call extensive, but if you can't make it to Grant Street on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon but happen to be heading eastward after your visit to Buffalo, you might catch the owners at the owners's table at the Ontario Antique Mall in Canandaigua.\",\n",

Why? Simply put, the food here is \\'\\'really, really good\\'\\': the freshest, tastiest seafood Buffalo has to offer, with shipments of high-quality product arriving daily from all over the United States. The marquee item at Bailey Fish and Seafood is the \"Haddock Super Sandwich\", a feast that truly lives up to The marquee item at Bailey Seafood\\'s superlative name: a gargantuan fried filet on a locally baked \\'\\'\\'Costanzo\\'s\\'\\'\\' bun, topped with tangy coleslaw and homemade French fries, big enough for two people to share yet at a price of only $5. The marquee item at Bailey Seafood and other sandwiches are frequently ordered in combos (or, for larger parties, \"family packs\") where the already excellent value for your money is improved further. Dinnertime at Bailey Fish and Seafood sees mains like breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp skewers, crawfish, steamed clams, and various fish filets served \\'\\'à la carte\\'\\' or in combo packs, and Bailey Fish and Seafood even sell fresh fish and one-, two-, and five-pound packs of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters if you\\'re planning an event. Meanwhile, the slate of appetizers and sides is where the Southern and Creole influences that pervade Bailey Fish and Seafood\\'s menu come out best: try the hush puppies, mac & cheese, fried okra, or homemade sweet potato pie if you want a sample. Service is quick and friendly especially considering the unrelenting crowds the staff has to deal with; if you want to make it easier on the staff and yourself, you can call ahead or order online and the staff\\'ll have your food waiting for you when you arrive.',\n",

As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal '''tomb of Iza Khan''', a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb. As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of The tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden. - The centrepiece is the eponymous '''tomb of Humayun''', the second Mughal emperor. Built starting in 1562, the eponymous '''tomb of Humayun''', the second Mughal emperor was the first major Mughal structure in Delhi's and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of Agra's Taj Mahal. The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around's husband, not the other way around. You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun's is buried. Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way. In the southeast corner is the '''Barber's Tomb''', also built in the same style. Historians do not know who is buried in the '''Barber's Tomb''', also built in the same style.\",\n",
