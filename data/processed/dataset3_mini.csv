While it's not as good as watching it from a front row seat inside the fences, it's excellent value for money. As of November 2009, extremely bright lights have been pointed at the roof of the Pizza Hut and various other buildings to get tourists to attend the show.

A sign in Greek outside the main entrance testifies to this. The church stands on the same grounds as the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria's offices and the Greek Orthodox cemetery.

When leaving Delhi from the international terminal, you should show up 3 hours before your flight is scheduled. For domestic flights, 2 hours should be enough, depending on whether or not you must wait in the queues to check luggage. While sometimes time-consuming, the process is smooth, and the new terminal's shops and restaurants are sensibly located at the gate area, not before security. However, if you wish to change Rupees back into foreign currency, you must do this before clearing security.",India

Delhi,other,New Delhi station,"(code ''NDLS'') is located just outside of Paharganj, also known as the backpacker ghetto. - It will take about 40 min-1 hr to travel from the New Delhi Railway Station to the airport by car, depending on traffic, a taxi fare cost you about ₨ 400. - A tourist ticket office called the '''International Tourist Bureau''' is open during office hours upstairs of, but still within, the main New Delhi railway station (on the side away from the metro, near platform 1). Note that it is only for foreign tourists, so you ''must'' have a tourist visa (i.e. student and working visas are not acceptable). Non-resident Indians can also book their tickets through this office. Bring your passport and cash or traveller's cheques in Euros, British pounds or US dollars. If you wish to pay in Indian Rupees (₹) you theoretically ''must'' show an official exchange certificate (from India, not valid if you changed in another country) or an ATM receipt. All ticket bookings require exact change, as like everywhere in India the office has little to no change. If you don't have exact change, it's possible after booking to go down to the food stores, buy food to get change, then return and pick up your ticket. To get a ticket, first go to the centre of the room and get numbers for the reservation and information desks, as well as a form to fill out. Then line up at one of the two u-shaped lines of chairs, fill out the form, and prepare for a protracted wait. When your information number is called, have the clerk check the availability of the train(s) you desire and answer any questions you have about the form. Then wait for your reservation number to be called. Note that by the time you get to the reservation desk, your train may no longer be available, in which case you can try to reserve a different one. If you need a bathroom during this lengthy process, there is a relatively clean male and female toilet just outside on the verandah through the side door (the door you didn't enter through). - The station is large, crowded, confusing and packed with touts. Allow ''one hour'' to find your train the first time you visit. Don't trust the electronic display boards, which often show incorrect information. Instead listen to the announcements and ask multiple people in uniform (policemen) until you find your train.",India

As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal '''tomb of Iza Khan''', a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb. As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of the tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden. - The centrepiece is the eponymous '''tomb of Humayun''', the second Mughal emperor. Built starting in 1562, it was the first major Mughal structure in the city and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of Agra's Taj Mahal. The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around. You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun is buried. Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way.

Alas, Chandragupta II's perfume has long since faded, but to the amazement of metallurgists everywhere, his pillar is still going strong, after 1,600 years. The corrosion resistance results from an even layer of crystalline iron hydrogen phosphate forming on the high phosphorus content iron, which serves to protect it from the effects of the local Delhi climate. The height of the pillar, from the top of its capital to the bottom of its base, is 7.21 m, 1.12 m of which is below ground.

Beware of the tenacious guides who will try and convince you that a tour guide is mandatory and is included in the ₹ 200 camera fee; they will give you an extremely hurried 'tour' of the mosque and then demand a further payment of ₹ 200-300 for the tour. You can climb to the top of the minaret for ₹ 100 (locals maybe ₹ 20). The climb is steep, dark and somewhat claustrophobic, but you'll get great views over the complex and the city. You'll need to cover up your shoulders and legs (scarves and lungis available for rental - about ₹ 10), and take off your shoes (expect to tip the shoe minder, ₹ 5 is plenty, or carry your shoes with you in your own bag). - Pictures should not be taken during prayer hours. If you're going to sit down don't look too comfortable. Certainly don't eat or become too engrossed in any reading material you may be carrying, the rule is that non-Muslims must make their visits brief and guards will usher along visitors who linger.",India

In the center of the plaza sits the '''Statue of King Charles III''' on horseback, facing the '''Royal Post Office''' (''Real Casa de Correos''), the red-and-white building adorned with a clock tower on the plaza's south side. Originally the building served as Madrid's first post office, then the police headquarters under Franco before being transformed into it's current use as the office of the President of Madrid, the head of the regional government.

Madrid,do,Real Madrid,"For football fanatics, a trip to the ''Santiago Bernabeu'', the home of local club Real Madrid is not to be missed. Real Madrid is the most successful football club in Spain and Europe, having been crowned Spanish champions a record 32 times and European champions a record 11 times. Their biggest rivals by far are FC Barcelona, with which it contests matches known popularly as ''El Clásico'' at least twice a year. The rivalry between the two sides is by far the biggest in Spain and one of the most intense in the world, and stems from the longstanding traditional rivalry between the Spanish and Catalan speaking parts of Spain. As such, tickets for such matches often sell out very quickly. In case you arrive in Madrid on non-match periods, you can take a self-guided tour of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. It includes tours around the field, the dressing rooms, the Press Room and the Real Madrid Museum where the trophies and other memorabilia are kept.

New York,eat,Bill Gray's at the Skyliner Diner,"This location is housed in a tiny 1950s-type diner, long and narrow like a train car.

No museum admission is needed to get to the restaurant (or to the carousel, for that matter!).",USA

Just ask; the staff is extremely accommodating; they'll make sure you get something you like. The falafel comes highly recommended.",USA
New York,eat,Campi's,"This tiny joint northeast of the airport is no longer Rochester's best-kept-secret; Adam Richman's ''Man vs. Food Nation'' recently featured Campi's signature dish, the massive Steak Bomber.

New York,eat,Mark's Texas Hots,This is where drunk college kids stumble off of Monroe Ave. to eat a garbage plate.

Mark's is the only diner you might ever visit that has a bouncer. Go if only for the spectacle.,USA
New York,eat,Nick Tahou Hots,"Tahou's is the origin of Rochester's authentic cuisine, the '''garbage plate'''.

New York,eat,The Pizza Stop,"As if a little slice of Brooklyn has been transported to Rochester, the Pizza Stop makes pizzas the way they do downstate; even NYC transplants approve! In addition to the thin Neapolitan style, they make a mean thick Sicilian as well, and their stuffed pizza is just over-the-top ridiculous. Their new location just down the street from the original opened in January 2015.",USA

But their catering division, which focuses on hot prime rib sandwiches, has been expanding in recent years (you can find them at Frontier Field, Sahlen's Stadium, and even the airport, for instance). Their latest venture is this sandwich shop in the middle of downtown. The prime rib is as juicy and tasty as you'll find anywhere, but they've also got Zweigle's hot dogs, pizza, wings, and specialty sandwiches, all made fresh daily.

Formerly located in the Grove Place district on University Avenue, Abyssinia opened in 2000 but had to close after a dispute with the property owner.

New York,eat,The Gate House,"This restaurant, named after its location in Village Gate Square, specializes in burgers and flatbread pizzas, but with a distinctly upscale twist.

Of course, this is Rochester, so you can even get a fancy version of a garbage plate. Reservations recommended.",USA
New York,eat,Highland Park Diner,"Rochester's last classic diner. A 1948 Orleans diner restored in 1986 to an art deco style. Their motto is ""real food, served real well at real prices"". A neighborhood joint with very good food.

New York,eat,Jines,"According to the jingle, ""Sooner or later, everyone dines at Jines,"" which may only be a slight exaggeration. Jines is one of a cluster of restaurants at the corner of Park and Berkeley, each with very popular sidewalk tables (at least in nice weather), which makes this a particularly lively and inviting stretch of Park Avenue. Jines was part of the wave of Greek-American diners that opened in the 60s and 70s, though this is more ""family restaurant"" than ""greasy spoon"". The atmosphere and service are familial (the Gines family still runs the place), and the menu is extensive, hearty, and not without its creativity.",USA
New York,eat,The King and I,"Located in Henrietta, a sprawling suburb that features mostly grimly terrible chain restaurants, this fantastic Thai spot features reasonable prices, lightning quick service (seriously, it's like they know what you're going to order before you get there) and food that always tastes uncannily fresh and yummy. The ambiance is not great, with a huge cavernous dining room and terrible, terrible art on the walls, but the food is consistently good and you can always get takeout. Make sure to try the Thai iced tea. No need to bother with reservations. Open for lunch and dinner.",USA
New York,eat,Olive's Greek Taverna,"Located in Rochester's snootiest suburb, you wouldn't expect the best deal in Rochester, but this charming restaurant will give you the most bang for your buck. Authentic and carefully prepared, don't miss the huge mezede village platter (an appetizer that can be easily shared by two or more), gyros and well-spiced kebabs. Lots for vegetarians, and unbelievable sweet potato fries. Reservations only taken for 3 or more. On the weekends they're basically required, or you'll wait hours for a table.",USA
New York,eat,Plum House,"This popular Japanese restaurant specializes in sushi, particularly their sushi rolls, each of which has a rather unique moniker.

The only staff are the friendly Japanese owners who will offer lots of guidance if you ask.",USA
New York,eat,Tavern 58 at Gibbs,"Classy yet casual, one of the newest and best-reviewed restaurants in downtown. They have positioned themselves as a great place to get dinner after seeing a performance at the Eastman Theater or Downstairs Cabaret. Dinner-and-theater packages available with some Auditorium Theatre shows; being able to park at the restaurant is a major benefit. Go for sandwiches if you want to spend less than $10, or steaks or seafood if you're willing to spend about $20.",USA
New York,eat,Tully's,Upstate NY chain sports bar with an enormous menu. The real attraction is the chicken tenders and honey mustard which are nothing like the frozen variety served at most sports bars. There are dozens of televisions which makes it a good place to watch a game.,USA
New York,eat,The Beale New Orleans Grille and Bar,"The Beale is known for their great BBQ dishes, but they've also got some good Cajun and Creole offerings. There is also live music&mdash;blues, primarily&mdash;five nights a week. In addition there is a good selection of beers at the front bar to go with the food.",USA
New York,eat,Dinosaur Bar-B-Que,"Amazing Ribs, Chicken, and Black Beans and Rice among many other things. Expect to wait though! Average wait for a table is easily an hour, they don't take reservations, and unless your whole group is there you can't get on the list. They're a tad vigilant about it, but the place pushes so much business through they can afford to do so. The Dino is a must when in Rochester, if only for some of the sauce.",USA

New York,eat,Sticky Lips Pit BBQ,"Again, it's not Dino, but Sticky Lips has its own vibe and charm. Its sauce bottles are decorated with 1940s-style pinups, and the decor features advertisements and periodicals from the same era. The food is good, too, with a very wide variety of options and combos, and five different sauces to choose from. Best part: they're never as crowded as Dinosaur.",USA
New York,eat,Sticky Lips BBQ Juke Joint,"The second location along Henrietta's commercial strip is much bigger, with live music just about every night and a full bar.

New York,eat,2 Vine,"2 Vine calls its combination of French and Italian food a ""bistrotoria""&mdash;that is, a combination of a bistro with a trattoria. The new decor and menu, introduced in 2016, reflects a renewed focus on casual accessibility. Delicious vegetarian dishes, as well as a wide selection of fish, veal, etc. Moderately priced and near The Little Theatre.",USA
New York,eat,Atlas Eats Kitchen and Bake Shop,"While the Bake Shop offers light sandwich fare and breakfast dishes, the real attraction here for foodies is their Edible Atlas dinner series. Every two weeks, the kitchen selects a whole new cuisine to present to intrepid diners, be it Mexican, Korean, Greek, or anything else the chefs can think of. The menu is set in advance; all you have to choose is your beverage. You'll want to get reservations, though, as the restaurant offers only 18 seats for each of its two seatings twice weekly.",USA

New York,eat,Char Steak and Lounge,"After several years of decline, the former Grill at the Strathallan has been rejuvenated as Char Steak & Lounge, and it's still one of the finest dining options in Rochester. Upscale American cuisine in a contemporary lounge setting. (Also open for breakfast, featuring DoubleTree hotels' standard breakfast menu.)",USA
New York,eat,Good Luck Restaurant,"Despite the name, this isn't some Chinese takeout joint. One of the most eclectic, see-and-be-seen restaurant/bars in Rochester, it's like Grinnell's for hipsters (but in a good way). The menu is ever-changing, but a few staples are always there, including the full pound hamburger. Other options often involve rabbit, duck, and squid, to give you an idea. Even the more pedestrian options, like the pizza and the steak sandwich, are made with high-end ingredients like bison-milk mozzarella. Whatever you order, plan to share it with the rest of your party; all of the dishes are meant to be sampled, family-style. Reservations strongly recommended.",USA
New York,eat,Grinnell's Restaurant,"This is the type of place your parents went to for their 5th anniversary&mdash;take that as you will. While the menu is firmly rooted in the 60s and 70s, Grinnell's devoted customers keep coming back for the absolutely impeccable service. From the complimentary valet parking, to the maître d' up front (usually the owner himself), to the veteran servers, the restaurant's staff perfectly balances a friendly, welcoming atmosphere with the courteous respect that defined mid-century hospitality. The food is highly acclaimed as well, though it's hardly adventurous; just basic well made steaks, chops, and seafood.",USA
New York,eat,Lento,"With a name that means ""slow"", Lento prides itself on taking no shortcuts in the preparation of fine meals. Everything on the menu, right down to the ketchup on the $12 burgers, is made in-house, from primarily local ingredients whenever possible. The care taken in preparation is reflected in the quality of the food. Lunch service began in Spring 2012, with a focus on getting diners in and out relatively quickly.",USA

New York,eat,Next Door Bar & Grill,This restaurant is owned by Wegmans and showcases what Wegmans chefs can do. The menu changes frequently and covers a wide variety of cuisines.

New York,eat,Ox and Stone,"The former location of Rochester's most upscale restaurant, the '''Rio Bamba''', is now a slightly less upscale Mexican-American restaurant. The Bamba's unique Latin-themed decor remains, however, and the unique cuisine continues to get good reviews. Pig's ears, anyone? Or fried insects? If you want more traditional fare, the tortillas are freshly made in-house.",USA
New York,eat,Phillips European,"The food is only ok, heavy, traditional French&mdash;good for a business lunch or unadventurous out of town guests&mdash;but the desserts are ''spectacular'', with emphasis on pies, tortes, tarts, cakes and specialty cheesecakes. Examples include their Chocolate Tiramisu Torte and White Chocolate Carrot Cake. The mere mention of a trip here for coffee and dessert will get Rochesterians salivating. A full dessert menu is available in the restaurant, but the cakes can also be ordered whole and picked up.",USA
New York,eat,The Revelry,"Creative contemporary Southern/American fare in a very ''cool'' renovated industrial setting. Enjoy the lively bar and its scintillating decor, the breezy and fresh patio, or the somewhat quieter upstairs dining room. Not a place for comfort food; in fact, the menu occasionally errs on the side of weirdness, but it changes seasonally so it's always worth taking a chance.",USA
New York,eat,Rooney's,"Nestled in Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood, near the Highland Park Diner, Rooney's doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside, though, is one of the city's best-kept secrets. Upscale dining in a rustic-romantic atmosphere makes this an excellent choice for anyone wanting to impress a guest. The menu is upscale American&mdash;veal, duck, lamb, swordfish, etc.",USA
New York,eat,Tournedos Steakhouse,"Possibly the most expensive meal in Rochester... or, for that matter, in the entire six-county area. The menu represents all of the high-end standards without going overboard on the creativity. The service is regarded by locals as impeccable.",USA
New York,eat,TRATA,"An old military armory is the setting for this trendy, upscale-casual hotspot. What does upscale casual mean? Consider that there's a variety of contemporary dishes on the menu, but you'll also find a ""burger bar"". (Sunday brunch includes a ""hangover burger"" and fried PB&J among other treats.) Put on your best pair of jeans and enjoy. Some diners report inconsistent experiences with the food and service, but the unique setting and romantic atmosphere more than make up for any snags; TRATA is all about the atmosphere and the environment. There's a rooftop bar and some amazing outdoor seating available; inside there are more bars and seating across three floors of space.",USA

His schedule varies seasonally, so check the web site. Wherever he's at, and whatever the weather, Uncle Ralph cooks up a variety of meat-based entrees on his outdoor grills.",USA
New York,eat,Vive Bistro and Bakery,"A high-end, thoroughly vegan French bistro. It's a little piece of French countryside transplanted to Rochester, but without a drop of milk or morsel of meat anywhere. While the entrees are outstanding, the desserts and coffees suffer a bit from the lack of true dairy; almond-milk ice cream just isn't the same. Still, if you're looking for a truly vegan restaurant&mdash;and not just ""vegan-friendly""&mdash;you'll find yourself at home here.",USA

New York,drink,The Distillery,"This popular sports bar and grill is expanding and now has four locations around Rochester. The food&mdash;including steaks&mdash;is quite good for a place known mostly as a sports bar. Also worthy of note are the specials: Before 10PM, there is a different draft beer on sale every day of the week. After 10PM, the beer sale ends, but all appetizers are half off. Naturally, the best time to arrive is 9:45PM.",USA
New York,drink,Jeremiah's Tavern,"The epitome of the neighborhood bar, Jeremiah's is best known for its award-winning wings.",USA
New York,drink,Lux,Lux is something of an alternative bar in Rochester and trades on being in the South Wedge to add cred to the atmosphere. Lots of tattoos and piercings and a good PBR special. The back yard is great. They have hammocks in the summer time and a huge wood burning stove for the winter. This place is something you would expect to find in Brooklyn not Rochester.,USA
New York,drink,Marge's Lakeside Inn,"Once a speakeasy during Prohibition, this joint was one of the first in the area to get a liquor license after it was repealed. Today, it's a wild and raucous neighborhood bar; there's no food, but folks come for the drinks and the atmosphere. The deck extends out onto the beach for a great view of Lake Ontario.

New York,drink,Rohrbach Brewing Company,"Although Rohrbach's is a bit out of the way, their beer is worth the trip. Certainly the highlight is the Scotch Ale, and if you don't want to travel all the way to the actual brewpub, any number of establishments in the city will have it on tap, including Frontier Field. However, if there, do try as many of the beers as possible, as it is some of the best craft-brewing in upstate NY. You can get a sampler of 3 oz. glasses before you decide. The food is also quite good and leans toward German fare such as sauerbraten and bratwurst.",USA

New York,drink,Sheridan's Pub,"This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave is truly a hidden treasure. It has some of the nicest staff you will find in the city and an overall friendly atmosphere. They also know how to pour the finest Guinness in the city. Although located near the U of R, Sheridan's is hardly a college bar attracting a diverse crowd. The food is also excellent, especially the fish fry that is served on Friday night.",USA

New York,drink,Wall Street Bar and Grill,"You can get meals here&mdash;with waitstaff, no less&mdash;but the drinks are the attraction at this spot that just opened in August 2012. In keeping with the name, drink prices fluctuate based on popularity... just like stock prices. Keep an eye on the price ticker; buy low and sell high!",USA
New York,drink,Chocolate and Vines,"The name is apropos, as this bar does indeed specialize in chocolates and wines&mdash;the former more so than the latter, some would argue. Still, the wine selection is expertly paired with the desserts, making this a very popular place for ending an evening on the town. Housed in an historic century-old house, the bar has a summer patio that looks out on the lovely Neighborhood of the Arts, a great place for people-watching.",USA
New York,drink,Flight Wine Bar,"Dressy, sophisticated, and urbane, Flight might be the most well known wine bar in the city. As you might guess, they specialize in wine ""flights""&mdash;tastings of a selection of wines based around a theme.

It's not just wine, either: cheese, chocolate, and even olive oil are presented in flights of three.",USA
New York,drink,Solera,"A small but high-quality wine bar in the South Wedge.

New York,drink,Veritas Wine Bar,"The owners of Veritas left Rochester for New York City, where they developed their love of wine. But years later, they returned to raise their family in a more affordable city. In 2012, they opened this wine bar, which, in their words, aims to be ""casual, warm and educational"".

New York,drink,Joe Bean Coffee Roasters,"A coffee roaster and full service coffee and espresso bar located near the Neighborhood of the Arts, Joe Bean has been mentioned among the best coffee shops in the country. They serve some food as well, but the real attraction is the java, which is fair trade and eco-friendly, and roasted right in-house.

New York,buy,Niagara Distilling Company,"With the Niagara Distilling Company, Nick Kotrides, once best known as the former owner of Hertel Avenue's '''Empire Grill''' and Elmwood's '''Toro Tapas Bar''' and '''Faherty's''', along with partner Eric Heuser, who brings to the table ten years of experience at a distillery in Germany, manufactures and bottles a range of organic farm-to-bottle craft spirits sourced exclusively from New York State suppliers. Niagara Distilling currently churns out 2,000 bottles a day of vodka and gin sold under the '''1812''' brand name — with plans to inaugurate a line of moonshine, bourbon and rye in the near future — in a former carriage house and stable whose historically-sensitive restoration was inspired by the revived Distillery District in nearby Toronto. Set back a good distance off Ellicott Street, you pass through a lovely outdoor courtyard with patio seating — a sort of ""beer garden"" for cocktail aficionados — to get to the spacious tasting room/retail outlet in the front of the building. Tours are also offered on request, and seminars are offered for those who'd like to try their hand at home distilling.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo Adore,"The second and perhaps more fortuitously-located branch of Buffalo Adore — South Buffalo's favorite outlet of one-of-a-kind Buffalo-themed gifts run by the husband-and-wife team of Andrea and Eric Dacey — opened up shop in the '''Market Arcade''' in September 2015. Here you'll find essentially the same merchandise as at the original Abbott Road store — the usual clothes and coffee mugs augmented by posters, embroidered wall hangings, decorative throw pillows, and other tchotchkes that are the work of locally-based artisans — but in a much more convenient and centralized location in the heart of the downtown Buffalo action.",USA
New York,buy,Clayton's Toyland,"The August 2015 opening of the second location of Clayton's Toyland marks a return to the city for a dearly-beloved local institution that left the Elmwood Village for suburbia years ago. At '''HarborCenter''' there's not as much floor space to work with as at the main location in Williamsville, so instead of a massive emporium of every kind of toy, game, and stuffed animal imaginable, here you have a carefully curated selection of products specifically selected with Canalside visitors in mind. Naturally, that means a lot of outdoor toys — get your kites, Frisbees, stomp rockets, and paddleball sets at Clayton's — as well as a cuddly stuffed buffalo free with every purchase of $40 or more. As at the Williamsville store, name brands, Disney and other corporate tie-ins, and video games and other electronics are eschewed in favor of a decidedly old-fashioned selection of quirky, high-quality toys that feed children's imagination.",USA
New York,buy,The Gift Loft,"Described succinctly and accurately by one reviewer as ""the only decent store left inside the '''Main Place Mall'''"", there's scarcely a better place to go than the Gift Loft if you're in the mood for the kind of souvenir or tchotchke that could only have come from Buffalo. The main stock in trade here are locally-designed, locally-printed and locally-themed t-shirts, glassware and other gifts that pay homage to all the facets of the Queen City's identity. From points of Buffalo pride like chicken wings and fabulous architecture, to dearly departed landmarks like the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', to local politicians and celebrities like Jimmy Griffin and Irv Weinstein, to Buffalo's vibrant Irish, Polish, Italian, German, and other ethnic communities — if there's something you noticed as unique during your trip to Buffalo, there's probably a gift here for you to commemorate it. (Yes, that even includes the smell of Cheerios that fills downtown courtesy of the '''General Mills''' factory.) The inventory also includes art and literature by local artists, posters and postcards, handmade jewelry, and an ever-changing range of miscellaneous kitschy baubles. Best of all, the staff — helmed by owner Edwin Jablonski — are supremely friendly, helpful, and will answer any question you have about their products or Buffalo in general.",USA
New York,buy,room2,"The second location of the upscale boutique of the same name that has made such a splash on Hertel Avenue has been in business at the Hotel Lafayette since 2012. In contrast to the focus of the original '''room''' on luxury furniture and housewares, room2 places more of an emphasis on quality gifts, many of which are locally-themed: quirky items such as buffalo-shaped bottle openers and throw pillows with the geographical coordinates of the city printed on them are a great way for visitors to downtown to commemorate their visit to Buffalo. A modest array of accessories such as scarves and jewelry are also on offer, and the typical stock in trade of the Hertel Avenue location is not neglected either: interestingly, many of the same upscale furnishings found in the Hotel Lafayette's guest rooms upstairs are available for sale at room2. As with the original room, the items at room2 are high-end and priced accordingly — the aforementioned throw pillows sell for upwards of $100 — so do not expect any bargains here.",USA
New York,buy,ScentCerely Yours!,"After six years of selling online the hand-poured soy candles she still produces at her home in Alden, runaway demand finally got the best of Sharon Snell, and she made the leap in late 2014 to a brick-and-mortar storefront on the ground floor of the '''City Centre Building''' in the Theater District. Still today, the pleasant interior of ScentCerely Yours!, all light-colored wood with rustic folk-art touches, brings a bit of the downhome charm of countrified Alden to the downtown core — and it's a feast for the nose as well as the eyes; customers are encouraged to sniff-test the candles for themselves, and there are even coffee tins provided on each shelf as a sort of olfactory palette cleanser. Snell takes pride in formulating each of these scents herself, and there are some really creative and unique options to be had here — ""Forget-Me-Not Linen"", ""Watermelon Lime Splash"", and the musky, manly ""His Place"" are some of the more interesting ones — all boasting aromas that are subtly pleasant without overpowering you with their odor. Snell individually tests each candle before sale, and perhaps most importantly of all, unlike many eco-friendly candle manufacturers all of ScentCerely Yours' products are made of 100% soybean wax, with no paraffin or other dirty-burning additives. A range of decorative candle holders and other related accessories are also on offer.",USA
New York,buy,Abino Mills Glassworks,"""Swarovski with a Buffalo twist"", in the words of one visitor: at Abino Mills the name of the game is one-of-a-kind, customized etched glass, courtesy of mother-and-son owner team Connie and Ted Constantine. From her former career as a photo restorer, Connie has brought to bear dedication, patience, and an unwavering eye for detail to this new venture which began in the family basement before growing into a storefront in suburban Williamsville in 2012, and from there to its current location four years later — with end results that are a cut above what you'll find elsewhere. The interior of Abino Mills is perfect for browsing — the hardwood floors, dark-toned walls, and warm lighting (brought to you by Buffalo's own '''Litelab''', best-known for designing the light-up dance floor in the movie ''Saturday Night Fever'') really draw shoppers' eyes to the merchandise on the shelves. Speaking of, the selection here consists of a wide variety of bowls, vases, wine glasses, decanters, and the like, crafted in the finest Riedel and Darlington crystalware whose etchings often reflect a Buffalo theme — the kind of upscale, intimate shopping experience that brings to mind the Delaware Avenue of old. If none of that is to your liking, you can work with Abino Mills' staff to create your very own designs.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo Barkery,"If the name of this place brings to mind a bakery for dogs, that's entirely intentional: the Buffalo Barkery opened its doors in downtown's '''Market Arcade''' in April 2016, the brainchild of a pair of dog-loving sisters-in-law who'd been searching for an alternative to mass-produced, overprocessed pet foods before taking matters into their own hands, offering a line of all-natural, homemade dog biscuits and treats made with all human-grade ingredients (and without preservatives, by-products, or unnecessary fillers). The ""Buffalo"" half of the moniker is done justice as well — specialty biscuit flavors include beef on weck and Buffalo chicken wing, and they also sell a yummy pumpkin treat in the shape of Canalside's own '''Shark Girl'''. Beyond the realm of the edible, Buffalo Barkery also offers a carefully curated range of high-quality squeak toys, shampoos and grooming supplies, and collars and leashes, all manufactured in the United States. Cat fanciers aren't left in the cold, either: a range of collars, catnip mice, and the like are sold as well.",USA
New York,buy,Fowler's Chocolates,"Fowler's was one of the quartet of businesses that opened in the brand-new '''Shops at HarborCenter''' in summer 2015, but really it's just the latest iteration of a Buffalo tradition of over a century running. Here sweet-toothed visitors to Canalside can pick up what's considered by wide local consensus to be the best sponge candy in Buffalo, along with a range of other locally-manufactured chocolaty treats and ice cream from Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''.",USA
New York,buy,Lincoln Coin & Stamp Company,"In business in the Theater District since 1972, owner Lou Montesano has built Lincoln Coin & Stamp's renown with collectors from all over the city and region with his honesty, integrity, and friendly and helpful service to his customers. A wide and changing selection of coins and stamps of all descriptions are available, as are supplies and accessories for the collector. Appraisal service is also available. Despite Lincoln Coin & Stamp's downtown location, ample free parking is available!",USA
New York,buy,M. Steffan's Sons Leather Supplies,"M. Steffan's Sons was founded in 1851, and is the oldest continually-operated leather goods store in the United States. Once a powerhouse in the industry, furnishing supplies from its own tannery to the majority of America's shoemakers and harnessmakers as well as selling its own shoes under the '''Winchester''' brand name, Steffan's today is a smaller business, occupying an unassuming storefront at the north end of the Theater District. There, a huge variety of merchandise is available — buckles, rings, rivets and snaps, leather shoelaces, leatherworking supplies such as needles, shears and thread, and a myriad of other items — all curated by Linda Steffan, scion of the same family that's owned the business for over a century and a half, and her trusty dog Milo. Friendly and helpful customer service is king here — Steffan really goes out of her way to educate local crafters about the art of shoemaking and leathercraft, going so far as to offer workshops every Monday morning where enthusiasts can learn from experts in the field in a hands-on manner. Steffan's will also gladly repair your leather shoes, handbags and other accessories, and phone and fax orders can be shipped nationwide.",USA
New York,eat,Bada Bing Sports Bar & Grill,"Bada Bing was one of the last holdouts at the former '''Delaware Court Building''', which was demolished at the end of 2013 to make way for a new high-rise — but now it's back in a new location at the other end of Chippewa Street. Much more than just another rowdy Chip Strip nightspot, head chef Dominic Paladino has set to work transforming the place into an authentic Italian restaurant where guests are treated like family. An ''Artvoice'' feature story described Bada Bing's fare as ""pub grub with an Italian twist"" and gave a succinct description of the ""sangwiches"" served there — garlic bread and grated cheese concoctions that are Paladino's own creation. Pasta, chicken and sausage parmigiana, chicken wings and fingers, and salads are also available.",USA
New York,eat,The Blue Line,"For a light lunch or dinner in a setting unlike any other, the place to be at Canalside is The Blue Line. An outdoor café situated on a pedestrian bridge above the reconstructed Erie Canal — right above the site where the Buffalo Sabres used to face off against their opponents at the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', hence the name — the Blue Line's menu is a combination of the best of two separate Buffalo restaurants. '''Code Blu Juice Bar''', formerly of Allen Street, sets up shop at lunchtime seven days a week with a menu of healthy smoothies and juice blends, as well as a modest range of light salads such as lentil, wheatberry, and curried chicken. Then, four days a week at dinnertime, '''Just Fries''' (whose brick-and-mortar location can be found on Genesee Street) serves up its eponymous food in a myriad of different gourmet permutations — appetizer-sized potions topped with a variety of sauces and aiolis (including numerous vegan options); main-course ""loaded fry"" platters topped with ground hamburger and cheese, souvlaki meat, and more; desserts of sweet potato fries topped with marshmallow sauce, Nutella, brown sugar and butter, and more.",USA
New York,eat,Casa-di-Pizza,"After 62 years on Elmwood Avenue, Casa-di-Pizza moved downtown in 2015, making its mark on the revitalization of Buffalo's business district in its new home just off the burgeoning 500 Block of Main Street. Though the location has changed, the menu is much the same as before: at heart Casa-di-Pizza remains an old-school neighborhood pizzeria, Italian restaurant, and bar, whose food — chicken wings and fingers, subs, salads, sandwiches and burgers, pasta dishes, simple yet hearty homestyle entrees such as barbecue chicken and ribs, and, of course, pizza — is as delicious as it is unpretentious. One new addition to the menu are the ""breakfast pizzas"" served up to hungry downtown office workers on weekday mornings.",USA
New York,eat,The Dish,"When it opened in 2011 it was little more than Canalside's answer to '''The Hatch''' at Erie Basin Marina, with a pleasant and summery but fairly unimaginative menu of hot dogs, burgers, and ice cream. But lately owner Kate Elliott has revamped The Dish with a more upscale focus: to the pleasant surprise of diners, interesting new additions such as a tofu ''banh mi'' and curried lentil fritters have appeared on the menu, and old favorites were given innovative new twists, such as a burger made with a blend of short rib and sirloin sourced from '''Pat LaFreida Meats'''. Breakfast time sees a variety of egg sandwiches served up for early birds. As always, ''al fresco'' dining is the rule at The Dish: long communal tables line the boardwalk along the side of the river, with refreshing lake breezes caressing you and the plaintive wail of seagulls serenading you as you eat.",USA
New York,eat,E-Café,"The aptly named E-Café is more than just another lunch-break destination for the suit-and-tie crowd — it's a veritable Internet café, rare in these parts, with free WiFi and a collection of wired PC terminals available free to customers. In this spacious restaurant, which boasts high ceilings and walls painted in bold yet pleasant autumnal tones of yellow and orange, you can get simple but well-prepared lunches and breakfasts served with a smile and lightning speed. The usual range of subs, wraps, burgers, soups, and salads are all on offer and all delicious, but E-Café's customers reserve special praise for the dozen or so melt and focaccia sandwiches on offer at lunchtime, from hot ham and roast beef to turkey reuben on rye to tuna on sourdough. Breakfast sees office workers savoring the scent of bacon in the air as they gobble up omelettes and breakfast sandwiches (available on English muffins or bagels) before the workday begins. The downside is the coffee, which is just okay. On Fridays they close early, but make up for it with free fountain beverages all day.",USA
New York,eat,Emerson Commons,"Emerson Commons is a food court that's staffed by high school students and faculty from the Buffalo Public Schools' '''Emerson School of Hospitality''' and open on school days. Appropriately enough, the fairly pedestrian cuisine here can be likened to school cafeteria fare kicked up a few notches in quality — the upside, however, is that this is among the most affordable food you can get in the downtown core. Lunchtime offerings change daily; the menu usually contains two soups, two hot sandwiches, and three heartier main courses. The current week's menus are posted at the website for those who want to make their mind up in advance. Pizza by the slice, a salad bar, and an assortment of homemade desserts are available every day. Breakfast is also served.",USA
New York,eat,EXPO Market,"The founding credo of the Pan-American Exposition, held in Buffalo in 1901, was all about ""bringing closer together the peoples of this hemisphere in their social, political, and commercial relations"", and it's that collective community spirit that inspired the name of EXPO Market, opened in 2016 in the former home of '''Perfetto''' restaurant by a partnership of local real estate developer Nick Sinatra and restaurateur Paul Tsouflidis, owner of Elmwood Avenue's '''Acropolis''', '''Newbury Street Café''', and '''Crush Juicery''' (the latter two of which have satellite locations here). EXPO has been described variously as a ""food court"" for the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''' and as downtown's fancier, less culinarily daring answer to the '''West Side Bazaar''', but perhaps a better comparison would be to an upscale take on a university dining hall — compete with colorful contemporary decor on the walls, ''loud'' piped-in music (mostly upbeat, singalong-able '90s and early '00s alt-rock hits), and an overall surprisingly youthful feel to the place. The dimly lit interior of this cavernous space accentuates stylish decorative accents like the exposed brick of the wall and the track lighting and exposed ductwork on the ceiling, while also calling attention to the brightly lit LED screens and lighting elements that make up an important component of the decor. EXPO is home to five food counters, most of which are satellite locations of brick-and-mortar restaurants elsewhere in Buffalo, and all of which offer quick service to the downtown lunch crowd. There's also '''GBGB''' — Gypsy Bohemian Grove Bar — where a team headed jointly by the folks behind the West Side's '''Gypsy Parlor''' and Allentown's '''Duke's Bohemian Grove''' pour a range of craft brews as well as some of Gypsy Parlor's signature cocktails — and, in the morning, locally brewed '''Public Coffee'''.",USA
New York,eat,Bobby Alfman's Gourmet Sandwiches,"Run by a partnership helmed by Charlie Goldman of '''Allen Street Hardware Café''' fame, Bobby Alfman's can be compared to a gourmet (and gourmet-priced) version of '''Subway''' sandwich shop. On the menu are your choice of seven deli sandwiches served on same-day-baked 12-inch hoagie rolls — the Number 4 (pastrami and corned beef with Swiss cheese and onion) packs a nice kick courtesy of the spicy mustard it comes slathered in, while the Number 1 (Italian beef with stewed tomatoes and provolone) is pretty underwhelming. Potato chips, fountain drinks, and a soup of the day are available as sides, but on an ''à la carte'' basis only — sadly, there's no ""Fresh Value Meal"" equivalent in the Subway analogy.",USA
New York,buy,Crush Juicery,"Unlike many EXPO Market vendors, the menu at the satellite location of Crush Juicery is comparable in range to its original location: all thirteen of the smoothies and all four of the granola fruit bowls that are available at their little counter within '''Newbury Street Café''' on Elmwood can also be enjoyed at their stand-alone booth downtown, and although the original's cold-pressed juices and herbal teas are missing, that's made up for by an enticing menu of $5 breakfasts that are available all day: oatmeal bowls with your choice of fruit topping, yummy Greek yogurt parfaits, and spicy, savory avocado toast topped with crumbled goat cheese. As at its counterpart, though, the smoothies are the biggest draw at Crush Juicery — standouts include the ""Ventura Boulevard"" (with kale, banana, raw cashew, agave nectar, and almond milk) and the ""Oxford Street"" (avocado, kale, pineapple, banana, coconut water, and spirulina) — all clean, green, healthy, and packed with energy and nutrients. If you want an extra bit of oomph, you can even order your smoothie ""enhanced"" with boosters such as whey protein, turmeric, bee pollen, and creatine.",USA
New York,eat,Mercato,"'''Osteria 166''''s EXPO Market outlet offers an abbreviated but respectably diverse selection of a half-dozen signature pasta dishes that run the gamut from familiar but well-executed favorites like spaghetti and meatballs, to more interesting creations such as tortellini alfredo with peas, as well as changing daily specials. However, the most recommendable thing on the menu at Mercato is almost inarguably the $10 build-your-own pasta option that enables many combinations that are more creative than the menu standards. You get your choice of one pasta, one sauce, one meat (perennials like grilled chicken and Italian sausage but also pancetta and Italian pulled pork), and an unlimited number of the two dozen or so vegetable toppings Mercato offers (unique standouts here include escarole, pine nuts, and wild mushrooms). Throw in a side of risotto sticks or parmesan truffle chips, add a San Pellegrino soda to drink, and you're good to go.",USA
New York,eat,Newbury Street,"Another Paul Tsouflidis-owned Elmwood Avenue health-food purveyor with a presence at EXPO Market, at Newbury Street you can choose from a curated selection of their well-beloved wraps and burritos, the ever-popular spicy quinoa bowl with chicken, as well as the full range of signature salads that you can get at the original — yes, this includes the Brainy Beet and the Jalapeño Chicken. However, most visitors to Newbury Street opt for the build-your-own salad — you choose a leafy green as a base, any of four additional vegetable ingredients, premium toppings if you like, and dressing — and build-your-own quinoa bowls and wraps work under similar principles. The locally-baked multigrain bread offered for a paltry 35-cent upcharge, sourced from the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''', tops it all off (figuratively, and literally too if you like).",USA
New York,eat,Sun Roll,"The EXPO iteration of the West Side's ever-popular '''Sun Restaurant''' focuses not on tasty Burmese specialties but on sushi, many varieties of which incorporate chef/owner Kevin Lin's signature ingredient, black rice. Aficionados of the original location will be pleased to know that the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') is indeed included in the selection of side salads, and if you're not in the mood for sushi, you can also avail yourself of black rice pudding, steamed chicken or vegetable dumplings, or refreshing Thai iced tea or coffee to drink.",USA
New York,eat,Globe Market Café,"Best known as the locally-owned specialty food shop that has inspired such a rabidly loyal fanbase in the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo, the Globe Market also operates a small gourmet cafeteria in the '''Cathedral Park Tower''' that's regularly filled with corporate power lunchers from the nearby office buildings. Those who've experienced the Elmwood or Hertel locations will feel at home immediately among the large selection of gourmet specialty salads, sandwiches and wraps on the menu, not to mention the thing that's really put the Globe Market on the map: their daily selection of delicious soups made from scratch.",USA
New York,eat,Greenhouse Food Court,"Pretty much the only lifeline keeping the '''Main Place Mall''' alive is its food court (see infobox above), which at lunchtime on weekdays is filled with workers from the attached high-rise office tower. Indeed, if you're downtown on a weekday and you're in the mood for an inexpensive bite, it can be worthwhile to make your way through the corridors past the empty storefronts and enjoy pizza at '''Zesto's''' or '''Gino and Joe's''', deli sandwiches at '''Hoagie Brothers''' or '''H. B. Carver''', Mexican food at '''Tijuana Taco''' or Chinese at '''Ding How Express'''. On weekends it's a dicier proposition; though the mall is open seven days a week, many of the restaurants are closed and the ghost-town ambience can be downright eerie.",USA
New York,eat,The Hatch,"The Hatch is the snack bar at the '''Erie Basin Marina''', serving tasty burgers, hot dogs, fries, and a wide selection of ice cream and other frozen treats. The real appeal of The Hatch, though, are the lovely lake breezes and the stunning waterfront views that grace its visitors on hot summer days. This is why the Erie Basin Marina is popular not only with boaters but also with joggers, sunbathers, and people-watchers. Convenient to the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Military Park and all downtown attractions. Watch out for seagulls!",USA
New York,eat,Hot dog carts,"Downtown Buffalo's staple street food, and probably the most affordable lunch you'll find there, is served by the open-air hot dog carts that work the busy street corners of the business district. Unmissable with their big, bright red and yellow umbrellas, the most popular selection here is, of course, hot dogs (invariably '''Wardynski's''', for some reason), which go for around $2. Also available for a bit more money are jumbo all-beef franks, Polish and Italian sausage dogs, and, in some cases, burgers. Most carts also offer a value pack of two hot dogs and a drink, which usually run about $4.50. The friendly vendors cook your food before your eyes on portable outdoor grills, slather on the condiments of your choice, and customers can fish soft drinks out of Styrofoam coolers on the sidewalk nearby. On weekdays from roughly 9AM-4:30PM you'll find a dozen or more hot dog carts up and down the Main Street pedestrian mall (especially in '''Lafayette Square''' and around '''Cathedral Park'''), as well as other spots with heavy foot traffic, such as '''Niagara Square''' and '''Canalside'''. Some operate on weekends too, but they're much fewer and further between outside of business hours.",USA
New York,eat,Joseph's Panini Stand,"Located in the splendiferous lobby of the '''Ellicott Square Building''', this corporate power-lunching hotspot is operated by Joseph's Catering Service. As its name implies, Joseph's Panini Stand's specialty is a huge selection of delicious made-to-order panini and wraps. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose, according to conventional wisdom, but for something especially unique try the apple tuna panini or the onion teriyaki burger wrap. Add to this a wide variety of salads (small side salads, specialty main-course salads and a full salad bar), delicious homemade soups that are the highlight of the menu according to local consensus, and smoothies and smoothie shooters made with real fruit, and you have one of the business district's favorite spots for light, healthy and inexpensive lunches on the go. Vegetarians, vegans and the gluten-free crowd are well taken care of too, and not just with salads.",USA
New York,eat,Just Fries,"Ask local foodies what was the most anticipated restaurant opening in recent memory on the 500 Block of Main Street, and they'll invariably say '''Raclette's'''. But a solid second place has to be Don Warfe's lunchtime spot just a few doors down, which opened its doors in June 2016 at the end of a 19-month-long, stem-to-stern restoration of the historic '''Genesee Block''', the oldest building on the 500 Block (''c.'' 1845). The first rule of thumb for Just Fries is not to let yourself be put off by the lines that routinely stretch out the door — service is lightning-fast, and the food is worth it. That being said, for best results you should not bother holding out for a table in the postage stamp-sized dining room: if it's a nice day you can enjoy a nice ''al fresco'' lunch at one of the tables on '''Roosevelt Plaza''', or else take your order to go. As for the menu, the inevitable comparison is with Buffalo's other ""French fries as main course"" eatery, the ever-popular '''Allen Street Poutine Company''', and there are indeed some similarities — real, honest-to-goodness poutine is one of the biggest sellers here, available in both the classic fries-gravy-cheese curd setup and ""Buffalo style"" with blue cheese and hot sauce. But for the most part, the loaded-fry platters that make up the real backbone of the menu are distinct entities: the low prices they charge belie the size of the portions and the high quality of the ingredients. Standouts include the souvlaki fries (topped with marinated beef, feta, and ''tzatziki'' sauce), the ''pizza fritta'' (melted mozzarella, marinara sauce, and pepperoni), and the cheeseburger fries (ground Angus beef, cheddar, ketchup, and pickles). Surprisingly enough, the place's major weak spot are the fries themselves: Warfe makes much of the imported German ""air fryer"" he's purchased to cook up healthier fries with 40% less fat and 30% less calories, but consensus says a bit of the flavor is lost with that method. To drink you have a selection of locally-bottled '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas or — in a nod to '''Jerk's''', the old-school malt shop and soda fountain Warfe owns a block down Main Street — homemade milkshakes.",USA
New York,eat,Marotto's DuBois Restaurant,"Mark Marotto may be better-known these days as the chef, owner and namesake of '''Marotto's Restaurant''' in Kenmore. However, the original restaurant where he and his two brothers cut their teeth is still alive and kicking in downtown Buffalo, a block from Niagara Square. Founded in 1958 by Mark's father Jerry Marotto and continuously owned by the family since then, Marotto's DuBois complements the elegant upscale Italian fare available at the Kenmore location with a smaller but equally delicious slate of breakfast and lunch options perfect for on-the-go downtown office workers. Burgers and fries, club sandwiches (featuring turkey roasted and hand-carved in house), and similar items are available, as well as pasta dishes and other somewhat more elaborate fare. DuBois wears its old-school identity on its sleeve — the serving staff here is decked out in ""waitress whites"", and the place has the feel of a private club — and it's the perfect setting to bear witness to judges and officials from the nearby courthouse talking shop over lunch at ""The Roundtable"", or local hotshot attorneys relaxing at the cocktail bar which stays open long after the kitchen closes.",USA
New York,eat,Natalie's Mediterranean Eatery,"After having done a brisk business for over twenty years at the original Natalie's in Amherst, Tony Mansour brought his trademark slate of quick, light, all-homemade Greek and Lebanese specialties to a second location at the '''Genesee Gateway''' in late 2015. At Natalie's, downtown power lunchers have their choice of copious Mediterranean favorites such as shawarma, souvlaki, and gyro that can be ordered either as wraps or full-size platters; fresh, flavorful ''fatoush'' and ''tabbouleh'' salads, ''hummus'' and ''baba ghanoush'' appetizers, and — in the morning — a killer range of breakfast sandwiches. The vegan and vegetarian crowd will be particularly delighted with the wide selection of veggie-, falafel- and hummus-based wraps. Natalie's delivers, too.",USA
New York,eat,Prima Pizza & Pasta,"Serving the best pizza in downtown Buffalo, Prima Pizza & Pasta is situated at the east end of the Chippewa Strip and is a popular place to grab a bite to eat after a night of clubbing. In addition to the astounding variety of pizza, subs, wings, pasta, salads, and tacos are served.",USA
New York,eat,Roux Soup Bar & Café,"Opened in January 2015 by Jason Davidson, best known as the proprietor of the nearby waterfront seafood eatery '''Liberty Hound''', Roux Soup Bar occupies the space on the fifth floor of the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}} that was once its cafeteria; as you can imagine, this place is still most popular with ''News'' staffers, but it's open to the general public too (sign in at the security desk in the lobby), and it's a great place to grab an affordable lunch or light dinner downtown. With a wide variety of po' boys on the menu as well as a delicious seafood gumbo — not to mention its name — it's safe to say that the cuisine here skews Cajun and Creole, an idea that was born of Davidson's nostalgia for his former home of New Orleans. But Roux is no one-trick pony: the menu includes local favorites like beef on weck, familiar Greek diner fare like chicken souvlaki served on a pita, and even the po' boy template is used for sandwich fillings that have little to do with Creole cuisine, like chicken Milanese. Most diverse of all are the homemade soups, four apiece that change daily and draw from chef Jamie Zynda's encyclopedic repertoire of delicious recipes. Breakfasts are among the heartiest downtown has to offer, and there's a gargantuan self-serve salad bar. As for ambience, Roux mixes corporate sterility with a few delightfully unique touches: for a taste of local history, there's a glass display case at the front entrance where every day they hang the front cover of the 100-years-old-to-the-day issue of the ''News'', and the dining room boasts unsurpassed views over both Canalside and the ''News'' building's fourth-floor atrium, ringed with a giant trough where tropical plants grow year-round.",USA
New York,eat,Taki's,"Open weekdays for breakfast and lunch, this perennial favorite with the downtown office crowd serves simple but tasty Greek diner fare for reasonable prices. The interior is spartan and dated (try to snag one of the unfortunately limited number of outdoor tables if weather permits), but customers rave about Taki's fried-to-perfection French fries, homemade Greek dressing, and light and healthy souvlaki.",USA
New York,eat,Anchor Bar,"Easily Buffalo's most famous restaurant, and one of the few places in town that could justifiably be called a ""tourist trap"". Whether the Anchor Bar is recommendable to you largely depends on why you've come. If you're a hardcore chicken wing fan who wants to make a pilgrimage to the place where they all began, and maybe pick up some chicken wing-themed T-shirts and other merchandise while you're at it, you'll likely leave happy: this is indeed the place where, in 1964, chef Teressa Bellissimo fried up a platter of wings that she was about to throw away and served them, doused in spicy sauce, to a group of her son's friends who arrived at closing time. But if you care more about a quality dining experience than paying homage to chicken wing history, look elsewhere: service is generic, utterly indifferent, and seems designed to get you in and out as fast as possible, and the food quality and price point are pretty much what you'd expect from a place where the majority of patrons are out-of-towners rather than potential repeat guests. Offerings include wings in various sauces such as barbeque, mild, medium, hot, or ""suicidal"", and also a variety of salads, sandwiches (including that other standout of Buffalo cuisine, beef on weck), and simple but hearty Italian fare.",USA
New York,eat,Bambino,"Bambino Bar and Kitchen is a new restaurant downtown that has earned rave reviews for its casual, simple, and old-fashioned — yet upscale — Italian cuisine served up in an airy, inviting ambience in the Theater District. Wood-fired pizzas are a specialty, with the pizza oven open till midnight M-Th and 2AM F-Sa. By way of appetizers, the mozzarella bar — featuring balls of homemade, hand-stretched mozzarella cheese served with a choice of garnishes that includes Sicilian and Greek olive tapenade, prosciutto di Parma, and Caprese salad — is the most interesting choice. Completing the picture is the modest but delectable range of pastas, soups, salads and heartier entrees, the latter characterized by delicious pork and chicken cutlets of the type that made chef/owner Noel Morreale's previous restaurant, '''Fiamma Steak''' on Hertel Avenue, locally renowned. Some of Buffalo's best cocktails are served at the bar, catering and private party space are available, and live music performances happen periodically.",USA
New York,eat,Bijou Grille,"One of the Theater District's finest dining establishments, the Bijou Grille specializes in upscale Continental and Italian cuisine in a prime setting just across the street from the historic and beautiful Shea's Buffalo Theatre. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads are also available, and the second floor features two elegant and spacious banquet rooms.",USA
New York,eat,Cabaret,"In the heart of the Theater District, Cabaret is a popular place to enjoy high-quality upscale cuisine before or after shows and musicals. A wide variety of delicious salads, sandwiches, and entrees are on offer, with Continental and Italian selections predominating. A banquet room is also offered.",USA
New York,eat,Century Grill,"Conveniently located across the street from the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Buffalo, the Century Grill serves fine food in the majestic ambience of the historic former '''Ancient Landmarks Masonic Lodge'''. Entrees such as steaks and chops, roasted chicken, and pasta dishes are complemented by sandwiches, salads, and an extensive and creative array of appetizers. Local specialties such as fish fry and beef on weck are also served.",USA
New York,eat,Chris' NY Sandwich Shop,"Situated on the ground-floor storefront of the '''Colonial Apartments''' on the northern fringe of downtown, this popular lunch spot is a family-run operation, which cuts both ways: their website is not lying when it touts their ""generous sandwich[es] with the freshest bread and finest ingredients"", but it's hard to fire your own flesh and blood, which makes for less-than-stellar service. If you luck out, you might end up with a waitress that's friendly and efficient, but more often the service at Chris' is slow, indifferent, and downright surly. (Luckily, take-out and delivery are available.) Still, this place packs 'em in during their brief lunchtime opening hours, seemingly on the deliciousness of their food alone. The sandwiches served here are creative concoctions that are sure to be delicious no matter what you order, on your choice of ten different breads and with a variety of optional toppings. A particular favorite is the smoked turkey salad sandwich blended with fresh dill for an incomparable flavor. All sandwiches come with chips by default, but try a side of sweet potato fries for a $3 upcharge. Grilled fare such as burgers and steak sandwiches are offered (if you're a fan of turkey burgers, Chris' has an unusual abundance of varieties), specialty salads include a variation on caprese salad with lemon basil vinaigrette in place of balsamic, and fish fries are served on Friday. Prices at Chris' are high, but — if you're willing to put up with the aforementioned lousy service — you really do get what you pay for.",USA
New York,eat,D'Avolio's Kitchen,"In August 2015, the revitalized 500 Block of Main Street landed the eighth and newest location of locally renowned olive oil and vinegar purveyor '''D'Avolio''', and the second to feature an attached restaurant. D'Avolio's Kitchen sates the appetites of the downtown lunch crowd with a menu of ""build your own"" salads, pizzas, antipasto plates, and sandwiches (the latter come with a side salad or cup of soup) for $11.95 apiece. When you enter, you're shown to your table and given a laminate-surfaced blackboard menu and a dry-erase marker; just mark off your selection of ingredients (choose a bread/crust/base of some sort, one or two meats, one or two cheeses, veggie toppings, and condiments) and hand it to your server. There's not much in the way of side dishes or other items on the menu, but a soup du jour and seasonal fruit bowl are offered, as is a wide range of hot and iced teas and other nonalcoholic drinks, plus a somewhat more modest selection of beer and wine. The food is prepared simply but beautifully with time-tested Old World techniques that really bring out the subtle flavors of the ingredients, and portions are large. Best of all, before or after your meal, you can browse the sales racks filled with the same selection of gourmet olive oils and vinegars as at D'Avolio's retail locations.",USA
New York,eat,Deep South Taco,"November 2015 saw the debut of yet another entry in the roster of the emerging ""restaurant row"" on Ellicott Street: Deep South Taco is an upscale taquería situated in a former storage warehouse just off Lafayette Square. Paying tribute to his roots in the Southern U.S. with the name of the place, owner Richard Hamilton is an Oklahoma native and veteran restaurateur whose inspiration for Deep South Taco was the authentic, downhome Mexican cooking he dabbled in as a sort of antidote to the hoity-toity fine dining of the places he owned over the years. Far from the sleepy cantina you may be picturing, though, a meal at Deep South Taco is a real experience: as you walk up to the place you see a giant rotating ''lucha libre'' mask on the front wall of the building facing Ellicott Street, framed by psychedelic lights and visuals courtesy of an outdoor video projector; indoors you're bathed in garish blue, purple and red LED lights punctuated by the eerie greenish glow of illuminated heating ducts and bar taps. (If that sounds like too much sensory overload for you, there's also the more subdued environment of the heated rooftop patio, open all year, as well as the outdoor street-level patio perfect for warm summer days.) Deep South's menu is small but packs a punch, dominated by a range of different tacos that you order singly — at $4-5 apiece, you can mix and match a combination of several; favorites include the ''taco de pescado'' (with crispy or grilled tilapia and chipotle mayo) and the ''taco de carnitas'' (spicy pulled pork and guajillo serrano salsa). Tacos are served on homemade tortillas that draw mixed reviews: fresh as can be, but fluffier than you may be used to and sometimes prone to falling apart in your hand. Elsewhere on the menu, there's a meal-in-itself nacho platter smothered in melted ''cortija'' cheese for that extra touch of authenticity, bean and cheese tacos and mushroom tostadas for vegetarian visitors, a chips-and-salsa starter that comes with your choice of three of six salsa options, and side orders of Mexican street corn that are as authentic as it gets.",USA
New York,eat,Dinosaur Bar-B-Q,"Local buzz began to build about Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide — in 1998, when its second location opened in Rochester, and it amplified further when Dinosaur-brand barbecue sauces and other items began turning up in area supermarkets. And when the Buffalo location finally opened in February 2014, the local barbecue scene, formerly nothing to write home about, got a major shot in the arm: even the most ardent ""Buffalovers"" who've experienced it concede that local favorite-by-default '''Fat Bob's''' has some major catching up to do. Situated in a former Universal International Pictures film vault on Franklin Street, this location is smaller than others in the chain, but it's got the same rowdy roadhouse vibe and is brimming with historic character to boot. Dinosaur's fare is Kansas City barbecue done to perfection, lauded on the Travel Channel series ''Man v. Food'' and cited by many reviewers, media outlets, and satisfied customers as the best barbecue north of the Mason-Dixon Line — and by ABC's ''Good Morning America'' as the best in the whole country. Start with appetizers like out-of-this-world fried green tomatoes or ""Dino poutine"" topped with pulled pork, then move on to mains such as barbecue chicken, pulled pork, hand-sliced brisket, and catfish that come with your choice of sides (the mac & cheese is to die for and the peel-and-eat ""drunken spicy shrimp"" are gargantuan, but stay away from the bland ""A.K. Chili"") or as part of a range of combo platters, including a build-your-own option. Also available are some of the most mouth-watering ribs you've ever tasted, marinated all day in a secret spice rub then slowly smoked and glazed with just the right amount of Dinosaur's own barbecue sauce. Prices are decent, especially given the ''huge'' portions — those who are not so hungry might prefer lighter fare such as brisket and pulled pork sandwiches or various burgers — and service is efficient and exceptional, with a staff that's friendly to a fault and happy to point newbies to the best dishes on the menu.",USA
New York,eat,Frankie Primo's +39,"Opened in December 2015, Frankie Primo's is another milepost in Chippewa's evolution from one-dimensional strip of thumping dance clubs to multifaceted fine dining and entertainment destination. After 16 years as owner of '''Soho Burger Bar''' just down the block, Jay Manno jumped at the chance to open a second Chippewa Street eatery that would serve up some of the Italian food he grew up with — simple yet creatively conceived and well-executed specialties from his ancestral homelands of Sicily and Campania — in the former home of '''City Tavern''', whose old-school interior, with its exposed brick, warm-toned woodwork, and original tin ceiling, was a perfect match for the ""Little Italy-type restaurant"" he envisioned. Even the ""+39"" suffix in the restaurant's name is a subtle nod to his roots, being Italy's telephone calling code. The backbone of Frankie Primo's is a deceptively straightforward-seeming yet wide-ranging range of pizzas (fired in a brick oven; not too greasy, with a thin, crispy crust), pasta dishes (including the Roman specialty ''cacio di pepe'', the only place in Buffalo where you can find it), panini sandwiches (served on fresh, crusty ciabatta bread baked in-house), and main-course salads (the ''cavolo toscano'' is especially interesting; a heaping mound of kale topped with currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino romano cheese, and lemon vinaigrette), which come in ample portions and at prices that aren't half bad for what you get. About a dozen specialty cocktails are served up at the homey bar — classics like Negronis and Manhattans, plus more newfangled creations that still betray a strong classicist influence — and if you prefer your drinks at the table with dinner, the wine selection is encyclopedic.",USA
New York,eat,Kaydara Noodle Bar,"Kaydara Noodle Bar opened in August 2012 in the historic Sidway Building with a promise of ""a food experience unlike anything Buffalo has seen before"". True to their word, Kaydara's ambitious Asian-fusion cuisine delights lovers of Vietnamese, Lao, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine. The focus here is on noodle bowls — Kaydara's ''pho'' and beef udon bowl are particular favorites — which are complemented on the menu by fried rice dishes, salads and appetizers, and heartier entrees such as spicy black bean pork ribs and beef tenderloin. Vegetarians and vegans will also be pleased with the options offered at Kaydara.",USA
New York,eat,Liberty Hound,"Located inside the '''Buffalo & Erie County Naval Park''' at Canalside, Liberty Hound is a celebration of seafood from across the U.S. and the world, in a wonderful lakeside setting convenient to all downtown and waterfront attractions. Traditional offerings such as Maine lobster rolls and crab boil share space on the menu with exotic and innovative offerings, such as steamed littleneck clams with chorizo garlic butter and a Vietnamese-style ''banh mi'' sandwich stuffed with crispy fried calamari, that can be found nowhere else in Buffalo. Best of all are the refreshing lake breezes and lovely views over the waterfront and downtown.",USA
New York,eat,Local,"Justin Anderson bills his new eatery as a ""kitchen and beer bar"" — and true to that designation (and mirroring the evolution of Chippewa Street as a whole), the former '''Noir''' nightclub has been revamped into a completely new establishment that offers something more than drinking and rowdy clubbing. The ""kitchen"" half of the equation serves up a classed-up take on pub grub — one major standout from among the list of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers (mostly of the deep-fried variety), personal pizzas, and main-course salads is the ""Ultimate Chicken Sandwich"", where flavorful, well-seasoned grilled chicken comes topped with avocado, goat cheese, tomato, fresh basil, bacon, alfalfa sprouts, potato chips, and pesto mayo for a dazzlingly complex yet ultimately harmonious blend of flavors. A few heartier entrees are on offer as well, including a beer-battered fish fry made with the '''Southern Tier Brewing Company''''s ""One Buffalo"" American blonde ale — a huge seller on Fridays. As for the latter half of the surname, it's a bit of a misnomer — sure, you've got a pretty good selection of craft beers on tap from local and regional brewers such as the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''', '''12 Gates''', and '''Resurgence''', but also cocktails made with about 50 types of bourbon, Scotch and rye. In every aspect of the experience, Local does justice to its name — from the local craft brews, to the Western New York-based suppliers the kitchen uses in many of its recipes ('''Camellia Meats''' provides the ham for the Cuban sandwich and the ham and mozzarella melt, for example, while the jalapeño mustard for the soft pretzel appetizer comes from '''Deb's Delights'''), to the huge ""Buffalove"" sign adorning the back wall, even to the interior: wooden beams from an old barn in Clarence were reused here as wall paneling and to build the bar, for a rustic look redolent of nothing so much as an Old West saloon.",USA
New York,eat,The Lodge,"Those who have been paying attention may have noticed subtle changes afoot lately on the Chippewa strip — from a one-trick pony of thumping nightclubs to a much more multifaceted entertainment destination. The Lodge fits right in to that trend. Opened with great fanfare in December 2013, The Lodge is the brainchild of Adam March, a newcomer on the local restaurant scene who came to own the former location of '''Bayou''' nightclub by winning it from its former owner in a pickup basketball game. The Lodge is still part nightclub — it has a bar and party area on the upper floor that swings after dark, featuring a balcony with a sweeping panoramic view of Chippewa Street below — but its main raison d'être is an upscale restaurant, serving what head chef Fortune Macri describes as ""Bold New American"" cuisine, creative and upscale fare of diverse culinary influences. If it's a quieter experience you're after, head to '''The Observatory''', the Lodge's secluded second-floor patio with firepit and attached game room. Seafood reigns supreme on the menu, especially lobster, served milanese style and in a delightful take on mac & cheese; a selection of steaks and chops as well as more inexpensive pasta entrees are also to be had. The Lodge's appetizers are somewhat more adventurous, with Korean short ribs, chile rellenos, and moûles frites as popular options, as well as interesting sandwiches and burgers. The interior is intended to mimic the look of a mountain chalet or ski lodge, but architect Rohit Kapoor has brought a much less rustic and more modern touch to the design.",USA
New York,eat,Osteria 166,"Newly opened at the corner of Franklin and Mohawk Streets and already receiving rave reviews from hungry Buffalonians, Osteria 166 is a ""casual Italian eatery and pub"" that walks a fine line between the humble ""red-sauce Italian"" restaurants of Hertel Avenue and what's left of the Italian West Side, and the upscale establishments more typical of downtown. Entrees trend heavily toward the former, with classic favorites such as spaghetti and meatballs, shellfish fra diavolo, and an Italian sausage sandwich all making appearances on the menu. However, the appetizers are far more imaginative, with the creativity of the offerings in that category exemplified by grilled octopus, pork confit, and stuffed pepper risotto cakes. An impressive wine list caps off Osteria 166's menu in grand style.",USA
New York,eat,Pan-American Grill & Brewery,"The fact that the Pan-American Grill was the first business to open when renovations to the Hotel Lafayette were completed in early 2012 is quite apropos: the restaurant's lush decor, featuring furnishings original to the Lafayette that date back to the first decade of the 20th Century, is a tribute to the Pan-American Exposition, which took place in 1901 and for which the Lafayette was constructed. The Pan-American Grill shares the same owner as the '''Pearl Street Grill & Brewery''' (see below), which means that aside from the fact that many of the delicious craft beers brewed and served at Pearl Street are also available here, the menu at the Pan-American Grill bears a great deal of similarity to the one at its sister restaurant. To call the cuisine here ""pub grub"" would be to do it an injustice, but nonetheless, the fairly elegant take on classic American cuisine served here splits the difference between upscale quality and prices that are far more reasonable than other Hotel Lafayette dining destinations such as '''Butterwood Sweet & Savory'''. A familiar yet creative range of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees are accompanied by an ample selection of flatbreads and a range of homemade pizzas available in ""Speak Softly"" (12"") and ""Big Stick"" (18"") sizes — another evocation of the Pan-American Exposition era. Simply put, the Pan-American Grill is one of the best options in downtown Buffalo for those in search of a decent sit-down meal that won't break the bank.",USA
New York,eat,Papaya,"One of the first fine dining establishments to challenge Chippewa Street's previously monolithic identity as a thumping clubber's paradise, Papaya opened its doors in 2005 on the ground floor of the '''Hampton Inn''' hotel. Serving daring Asian fusion cuisine with an accent on Thai and Vietnamese influences, as well as sushi, Papaya's menu is one of downtown's most innovative. Beer, wine, sake, and cocktails are served including excellent martinis.",USA
New York,eat,Pearl Street Grill & Brewery,"Located in a 1841 brick block in the middle of the former Canal District, which the menu describes as once having been ""the most evil square mile in America"", the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery does its best to evoke those bygone days with an upscale — and unmistakably Buffalo — take on traditional pub grub served in a setting that has been beautifully restored to mimic its 19th-century ambience. An interesting variety of burgers, sandwiches and wraps — including an astounding pulled pork sandwich served with North Carolina-style barbeque sauce, and of course, beef on weck — and hearty entrees are all served, but particularly recommendable are the variety of pizzas on offer at the Pearl Street Grill. Best of all, the restaurant also doubles as a brewery, with a variety of award-winning beers such as their signature brew, ""Trainwreck"", that are brewed on the premises, as well as a rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. The Pearl Street Grill is very busy on nights the Buffalo Sabres play at home, due to its proximity to the arena.",USA
New York,eat,Pizza Plant,"After over a year of preparation, Bob and Dan Syracuse opened their long-awaited downtown Buffalo location of Pizza Plant in fall 2015, in the building at Canalside that's also home to '''Courtyard By Marriott''' hotel. Those who are familiar with the original location on Transit Road will be happy to know that the menu is exactly the same; for the uninitiated, the specialty of the house are '''pods''': like calzones but bigger, these football-shaped shells of pizza dough are as long as your forearm and contain your choice of pizza topping-style fillings (select from about two dozen specialty pods, or build your own). Equally worthwhile, though, are the selection of thin-crust and stuffed deep-dish pizzas, pasta dishes, and bread bowl salads (including, oddly enough, the best Greek salad in town), not to mention a craft beer selection that rivals anywhere else in Buffalo. Vegetarians, vegans, and the gluten-free crowd have a lot to choose from on Pizza Plant's menu, and craft beer tastings, live music, and other events are frequent.",USA
New York,eat,Raclette's,"In what must be a contender for longest lag between initial announcement and opening day, Raclette's opened its doors on the 500 Block of Main Street in March 2016, after just a bit over four years of preparation. The fact that the delay was due to the need for a complete top-to-bottom reconstruction of its building — one that many claimed was too far gone to be saved — is testament to the dogged perseverance and dedication of owners Paul and Sandra Wilkens, equally to the preservation of downtown's period buildings as to the provision of a topnotch dining experience to their customers. The specialty to which Raclettes owes its name is a Swiss French dish that one might describe as a cousin to fondue — you place a large block of cheese on a flat grill to slowly melt, then scrape it off onto a platter that includes buckwheat crêpes, potatoes and/or gherkins, and your choice of charcuterie meats. It's a dish that's available nowhere else in Buffalo, and the friendly staff is happy to walk newbies through the process, but a quick meal this is not — Raclette's advises you to allow at least an hour and a half for the whole experience. If you're pressed for time or otherwise not interested, the balance of the menu is made up of serviceable bistro fare — an interesting selection of Belgian-style ''moûles frites'', main-course salads, and ''coq au vin'' and other classic Gallic fare are dished out at dinner, the lunch menu boasts a range of croques and baguette sandwiches, the French onion soup and vegetable bouillabaisse (the latter one of the few items on the menu suitable for vegans) are spectacular, and there's an extensive and reasonably priced selection of wines available by the bottle or by the glass. All this goodness is served up in one of two environments: an oddly laid out but warm and comfortable dining room, with exposed brick walls full of old-school charm and comfortable, slightly offbeat furniture for an effect described by one reviewer as ""like dining in a wealthy friend's cozy library"", or else outdoors on the breezy sidewalk patio facing Roosevelt Plaza. If there's a complaint to be made about Raclette's, it's that the portions are more European-sized than American-sized (let alone Buffalo-sized), but the reasonable price point goes a long way to compensate.",USA
New York,eat,Seabar,"Aside from being one of Buffalo's finest sushi restaurants, Seabar is one of the premier destinations in downtown Buffalo for cocktails and a wide selection of entrees, with Japanese cuisine accompanied on the menu by specialties such as short ribs, glazed duck breast, and linguine with clam sauce. Convenient to the Theater District and the Chippewa strip.",USA
New York,eat,(716),"Located at '''HarborCenter''' a stone's throw away from the '''KeyBank Center''', (716) is the perfect place to catch dinner before a Sabres game — and even if you don't have tickets, the experience at Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' is, in the words of one reviewer, ""probably better than actually going to the game"". That's because you can watch the Sabres (or pretty much any other team) in grand style on the 38-foot-high (11m high) big-screen TV situated front and center above the bar and visible from all over the restaurant, as well as some 70 more HD screens covering pretty much every interior surface right down to the mirrors in the restrooms. Fans of traditional sports-bar pub grub will be happy with the menu, but those looking for something a little more distinctive won't be disappointed either — the fare at (716) includes interesting twists such as beer-can chicken seasoned with a secret-recipe dry rub and served with jicama slaw, Buffalo mac & cheese and fresh hand-cut fries, as well as a charcuterie pizza topped with soppressata, prosciutto, spicy Calabrese salami, pepperoncini, peppadew peppers, and a blend of mozzarella, provolone, and ricotta cheeses. All the food is reliably good, but special praise is heaped on the ""Power Play Poutine"", smothered in locally-produced Yancey's Fancy cheese curds and a gravy that boasts a spicy kick (some speculate that they add Frank's hot sauce). At the extra-long bar, bright white and illuminated to imitate the ice of a hockey arena, you can enjoy a choice of three or four dozen beers available on tap and in bottles, including a great selection of local craft brews from places like the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. The weak link at (716) is the service, which is often dashed-off and indifferent, if still passable.",USA
New York,eat,Tappo,"""Let's enjoy city dining again"", implores Tappo's website, echoing the sentiment of a growing number of Western New Yorkers. Developer Rocco Termini and Buffalo restaurateur extraordinaire Mike Andrzejewski teamed up in 2013 to convert the former Horton Coffee building into this casual restaurant serving Italian fare that is familiar yet creative and well-prepared. Diners rave about delicious interpretations of classic favorites like lasagne, chicken cacciatore, and Italian wedding soup, as well as more imaginative options such as a basil prawn risotto and Tappo's lauded brasciole. The wine list features no fewer than 41 imported vintages, with a few domestic wines for good measure. Best of all, the value for what you get can't be beat — and neither can the view of the downtown skyline from the rooftop patio.",USA
New York,eat,Toutant,"With Toutant, owner James Roberts pays homage to his roots in Louisiana bayou country — he took the name of the trapping and fishing camp that has family operated there for many years and applied it to the Southern and Cajun food destination he opened in downtown Buffalo in 2015. Local old-timers may remember the building's previous tenant, the '''Golden Swan''', one of the diviest of the dive bars of old downtown Buffalo — but oh, how times have changed. Toutant has been utterly transformed into three floors of class, with a beautifully restored bar at street level and upper floors that boast great views over the skyline. The decor is understated and mindful of the building's historic character, with exposed brick predominating. But you're not here for the view or the decor, you're here to eat, and at Toutant the choice is from a menu that's underwhelming in size but superlative in quality. Start off with a slate of small plates (""sharing is caring"", the menu reminds you) that include delicious, flaky ""cast-iron cornbread"", fried pork cracklins that according to one reviewer ""taste like bacon-flavored chips"", and sausage and bacon smoked in-house, then graduate to main courses including excellent fried chicken — crunchy and not too greasy — or jambalaya whose spiciness you can adjust to your taste, like in an Asian restaurant. All the dishes at Toutant are made with locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible. Weak spots include the service, which tends to be fumbling, thoughtless, and glacially slow (this place is newly opened as of this writing, so take those criticisms with a grain of salt) and the noise level, which can be deafening when the place is crowded (''i.e.'' more often than not).",USA
New York,eat,Ulrich's Tavern,"Opened in 1868 and named for a later owner, German immigrant Michael Ulrich, Ulrich's Tavern is Buffalo's oldest operating restaurant — despite the fact that it spent most of 2013 and 2014 intermittently closed due to the fiduciary woes of its former owners. Sadly, the German specialties that made up the heart and soul of its former iteration's menu are paid mere lip service, with maybe a half-dozen options, dubbed ""Ulrich's Favorites"", cordoned off to an isolated sector of the menu: you can get ''wienerschnitzel'', potato pancakes, ''rouladen'', and the ""Oktoberfest"", a platter of three German sausages and sides of sauerkraut and potato salad, but that's about it. The balance of the offerings consist of a slate of sandwiches, burgers and main-course salads that are upscale, but for the most part aren't anything you can't find elsewhere in the city. The sandwiches are big and hearty, though: local favorites like beef on weck and fried bologna with onions are present, the burger is a full half-pound of meat, and the shredded pork sandwich comes with pickles and is served on olive-pressed French bread. And while borscht is technically native to lands east of Germany, Ulrich's is one of the few restaurants in Buffalo where you can find it (and it's really good). As for drinks, Germanophiles who were disappointed with the food might like the beer and wine list better, with offerings from Germany and elsewhere.",USA
New York,eat,Bacchus,"Appropriately named for the Roman god of wine, Bacchus has always been Chippewa Street's odd-man-out, offering a decidedly upscale and laid-back experience since long before the rest of Chippewa's thumping party bars began to follow suit. Located in the historic Calumet Building, Bacchus is owned and operated by Buffalo's premier restaurateur, Mark Goldman, which locals know makes for an experience of unrelentingly high quality where meticulous attention is paid to every detail. Impeccably prepared specialties of diverse influences — entrees such as panko crusted ahi tuna, steamed Prince Edward Island mussels, and duck confit share space on the menu — are complemented by an impressive wine list with a variety of glasses, half-bottles and full bottles available to suit all tastes. Now open for lunch.",USA
New York,eat,Buffalo Chop House,"Proudly serving mouth-watering cuts of the finest aged USDA prime beef in an elegant setting, the Buffalo Chop House is the most exclusive restaurant in the city, with prices to match. What guests to the Chop House can expect, however, is luxury that is unmatched in the region, with a variety of steaks as well as pork, lamb and veal chops, chicken dishes, and mouth-watering seafood selections taking center stage on a menu that also features a huge selection of elegantly prepared salads and appetizers, the latter category predominated by seafood selections such as clams casino with apple-smoked bacon and tuna tartare with tomatillo and mango. In October 2014, owner Mark Croce also launched a ""5 for $55"" ''prix mixe'' menu inclusing an appetizer, main course with two sides, and dessert, the better for people to experience the Chop House ""without taking out a second mortgage"" (in his words). As for the interior ambience, it boastsh a '40s Rat Pack theme that was introduced as part of a recent $750,000 renovation, including a wood-panel inlay on the second-floor wall imported from Indonesia that features an image of Frank Sinatra. The Chop House also has Buffalo's finest banquet facility, the '''Franklin Room'''.",USA
New York,eat,Buffalo Proper,"In spring 2014, after a twelve-year stint on the corner of Franklin and Tupper, local restaurateur-turned-real estate magnate Mark Croce closed '''Laughlin's Beer & Barrel''', saying ""it was time for a change"". That change has come in the form of Buffalo Proper, a Roaring Twenties-themed cocktail bar and fine dining restaurant helmed by some of the heaviest hitters of the Western New York restaurant industry: executive chef Edward Forster, formerly of '''Mike A's at the Lafayette''', is joined by '''Vera Pizzeria''' founder John Karel and a pair of young upstarts he brought over from his most recent creation, Rochester's '''The Revelry''': Zack Mekida and Donny Clutterbuck. In a write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'', Buffalo Proper's food is described as ""honest American cuisine that honors the low country of the South"", but the maddeningly eclectic, immensely creative, and ridiculously upscale concoctions on the menu would be nearly unrecognizable to the average Southerner. For instance, they don't serve rabbit here: instead, it's ""tartine of rabbit en terrine"" with whole-grain mustard, arugula, pickled onions, and armagnac-apricot mostarda (whatever that is). Even that Southern favorite, slow-roasted pork, is crusted with candied malt, drizzled with an alegrette flavored with local craft beer, and accompanied by kohlrabi sauerkraut. A variety of steaks are offered, and if you're a fan of seafood, try the roast fluke with haricot, brown butter and toasted almonds, or the grilled wild sturgeon garnished with shallots and shaved apples. And yes, all this is as expensive as it sounds.",USA
New York,eat,E. B. Green's,"Rated one of America's top ten steakhouses, E. B. Green's is located at the elegant Hyatt Regency Hotel & Suites, and is named after the man who was almost inarguably Buffalo's greatest architect, whose firm designed some of Buffalo's most architecturally significant buildings including the Hyatt itself. Skillful and attentive service, high-quality cuisine, and an upscale ambience combine to furnish patrons with a singularly elegant dining experience. Entrees include veal chops, seafood, duck, rack of lamb, and — of course — a dozen or more different cuts of steak. Sandwiches are available as well.",USA
New York,eat,Marble + Rye,"At Marble + Rye, Mike Dimmer and Christian Willmott take the upscale touch they brought to Buffalo's food truck scene in 2013 with the '''Black Market Food Truck''' into the world of brick-and-mortar restaurants, with smashing success. Located across from the restored '''Genesee Gateway''' buildings in a part of downtown that's become known as an up-and-coming hotspot for fine dining, Marble + Rye's small but well-curated menu is divided up into a selection of small plates and a somewhat more modest slate of full-sized main courses, emphasizing in both cases fresh, seasonal ingredients that are locally sourced whenever possible. The large plates are more expensive but a good sight less creative — a half or whole chicken comes with various mildly interesting accoutrements such as pork-fat potato and oyster mushrooms, while the steak is a run-of-the-mill if well-executed 24-ounce seasoned T-bone — but it's with the small plates where Marble + Rye really fires on all cylinders (and don't worry, you won't leave hungry if you order one; portion sizes are much larger than what you'd expect in an upscale restaurant). On that half of the menu, you have pickled onion rings with green garlic aioli; a grilled octopus appetizer that's inconsistent in quality but out of this world when at its best, with charred scallion, jalapeños, and romesco sauce; and a choice of four phenomenal burgers served on homemade buns and cooked to order with a mix of sirloin, brisket, and chuck, perfect for those on a budget. These and other culinary delights are experienced in a dining room that's rustic and homey yet urbane — exposed brick and finished wood abound — and the bright lighting is a welcome change of pace for those who are tired of squinting to read the menu in fancy restaurants. The character continues at the trendy yet laid-back bar, where the selection is dominated by regional microbrews and a range of truly creative house-exclusive craft cocktails making heavy use of rye whiskey, that newly trendy spirit to which the restaurant owes half its name. Service is topnotch: attentive, knowledgeable, and not dashed-off. This place gets crowded, so reservations are recommended especially on Friday and Saturday nights.",USA
New York,eat,Oshun,"Building on his smashing success at '''Shango''' in University Heights, in September 2014 Jim Guarino launched downtown Buffalo's first seafood restaurant in forever in a 1940s-era building that once housed the '''Waldorf-Astoria Lunch Counter''' and was later a shoe store. Named for the Yoruba goddess of the sea, here a range of amazingly creative seafood concoctions are plated up with aplomb by a staff of servers that really knows their stuff. Oshun also has one of the most delicious raw bars you've ever seen, featuring between eight and ten changing varieties of shucked-to-order oysters from all over the world. The menu consists mostly of small plates — if you're dining with a group, they say it's best to order two to three selections per person and pass them around to share — and boasts standouts such as a creative take on calamari (coated with a pineapple tamarind glaze and topped with a grilled corn salsa), seared bay scallops over coconut rice topped with popcorn (it works, surprisingly), and delectable king crab, lobster, and fish dishes. For those who don't like seafood, grilled short ribs, Jamaican-style jerk chicken served with plantain fritters, and other land-based entrees call to mind the Cajun fare Guarino serves at '''Shango'''. At the bar is served an ample selection of wines, creative cocktails, and a slate of regional craft brews. Best of all at Oshun, though, is the decor: the extensive renovation not only preserved original Art Deco interior elements such as the frescoes on the wall, but enhanced them with modern touches for an upscale ambience that blends the Roaring Twenties with the 21st Century in luxurious style: an Atlantean decadence that seems a world away from Buffalo.",USA

Boasting fine food and stunning views of Lake Erie from their patio that is open seasonally, Templeton Landing's entrees comprise hearty fare such as steaks, pork loin, burgers, and ribs, but the true pride of this place is their side dishes, which often share the spotlight with the main course rather than mere afterthoughts. Open all year, but summer is when you really want to come.",USA
New York,eat,The 31 Club,"The 31 Club began in the 1940s as Buffalo's premier supper club; though its original incarnation closed in 1983, it has now reopened in its original historic brick building on Johnson Park at the north end of downtown. The style and sophistication of the original 31 Club has returned, but with a contemporary twist. Freshly prepared Continental cuisine, such as Australian rack of lamb and filet mignon au poivre, is the rule at the 31 Club, as well as martinis and other specialty cocktails. Brunch and lunch are also served.",USA
New York,eat,William K's,"Though the Buffalo waterfront is still primarily a warm-weather attraction, the slow growth lately in the trickle of wintertime visitors to places like the '''Erie Basin Marina''' was significant enough by 2015 for local restaurateur Molly Koessler — coming fresh off a successful makeover of her Black Rock restaurant, '''Acqua''' — to take a chance on a waterfront restaurant that would be open 12 months a year. Appropriately enough, it was on New Year's Eve that the ribbon was cut on William K's. Located next to '''The Hatch''' just past the entrance to the marina (there's always ample parking in the huge lot across Erie Street), William K's dining room is gifted with spectacular views over Lake Erie and across the mouth of the Buffalo River to the historic lighthouse — but unlike some other waterfront restaurants that are content to sell themselves based on scenery, this place follows through with food that's a cut above the competition in quality, elegance, and price. The menu here is smallish and could be described as an especially innovative take on the upscale steak-and-seafood template with the balance tipped decidedly in favor of the latter: the grilled Spanish octopus over chorizo and chickpea stew is a tantalizing combination of flavors and textures, and a changing selection of fresh seafood from the Gloucester Fish Market comprises the ""Boston's Finest"" seafood platter. Elsewhere on the menu, you've got a variety of steaks and chops, a roasted beet salad topped with burrata, masala milk powder, and locally sourced honey that's arguably the most popular item on the menu, and — for those with a smaller budget to work with — a selection of thin-crust brick-oven pizzas with some very interesting toppings (how about bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, fresh horseradish, and pecorino romano cheese?) Portions tend to be a bit on the small side for the money, but the service is unfailingly attentive and friendly, and there's an extensive wine list and some great craft cocktails at the bar.",USA

No more. A recent change in ownership has breathed new life into this stagnant downtown institution: drawing inspiration from the places new owner Michael Khoury used to frequent in his hometown of Brooklyn, like '''Foragers Market''', the Washington Market has teamed up with '''Buffalo Cheese Traders''', Niagara County's own '''Dispenza Meats''', and other Western New York producers to offer a much wider range of fine foods with an emphasis on locally-sourced items.",USA

An essay by Charles Beveridge on the Olmsted park system in Buffalo describes how well Delaware Park continues to fulfill its intended role as a place for Buffalonians to experience nature and greenery without leaving the city limits; Delaware Park, as per his essay, is ""the only public space designed by Olmsted in Buffalo that met his definition of the term 'park' — a setting of pastoral scenery extensive enough to provide complete escape from the artificiality and noise of the city.""

New York,do,Voelker's Bowling Center,"Situated at the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street and especially popular with students of nearby Buffalo State College, Voelker's may seem like it was plucked from another time. Behind a lively bar redolent of old-school Buffalo — the kind of place where you might see Pabst Blue Ribbon being drunk by rough-around-the-edges blue-collar types, rather than ironically by hipsters — are 36 bowling lanes, as well as three pool tables and a few dartboards. Open daily till 4AM, Voelker's is the place to go for late-night bowling in Buffalo.",USA
New York,do,Hippodrome Billiards,"The oldest continually operating billiard hall in North America, Hippodrome Billiards opened in 1914 in the Theater District; through its early years of operation, some of history's great pool sharks, such as Minnesota Fats and Willie Mosconi, were regulars here. Sadly, Hippodrome is situated today in a nondescript suburban-style strip mall at the southwest corner of Delaware and Hertel Avenues. Despite the unfortunate location — and its spacious, bright and clean ambience that runs counter to the stereotype of pool halls — Hippodrome manages to conserve some of the old-school feel with chairs, cue racks, and several billiard tables retained from the original property. And, for those who'd rather skip the history lesson and just shoot a few games of pool, Hippodrome's rate of $4 per person per hour is hard to beat.",USA
New York,buy,Bon Fire Craft,"After six years spent plying her wares as one half of the duo behind the Nyack, New York artisanal smithery '''Torch Song Metals''', Emily Sajban packed up and moved west, opening Bon Fire Craft in February 2016 at the recently vacated former home of '''Queen City Shaken & Stirred'''. Jewelry is the game here, and this is perhaps the only jewelry shop of its kind in Buffalo in that all stages of production take place in-house: these earrings, necklaces, birthstone pendants, rings, and other pieces are hand-forged, hand-cast, hand-carved, and gems and other inlays are hand-set by Sajban herself. There's definitely a house style here, but it's hard to put your finger on and may be impossible to describe in any succinct way — ""rustic"" might be the word that comes closest; popular artistic motifs include trees, leaves, and bears and other forest animals, as well as skulls and Indian-head nickels — and since every piece sold here either comes in a limited-edition run of no more than 50 pieces or else is custom-designed by Sajban to the specifications of a particular buyer, you can be assured that no matter what strikes your fancy on the shelves at Bon Fire Craft, you'll be the only one of your friends to have one! The selection is plentiful for men as well as women, and prices are easy on the pocketbook.",USA
New York,buy,Korona Jewelry,"Describing themselves as ""A Gem on Hertel"", Korona Jewelry has been a North Buffalo institution since 1900, making it the longest-running family-owned jeweler in Buffalo. Owner Joseph Korona, a consummate professional who is a graduate of the Gemological Institute of America, and his wife Noreen run the store in a way that combines the best of the old school — warm and friendly care given to each customer and old-fashioned pride taken in quality workmanship — with the latest in modern techniques and technology. Korona's stock in trade is new and vintage rings, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, watches, and other jewelry in gold and sterling silver, with a full range of diamonds and other precious stones. Bridal jewelry is a particular specialty, and staff is happy to work with customers to design custom pieces to their personal specifications. In addition, Korona Jewelry performs high-quality repairs, re-stringing and stone resetting, and replacement of watch batteries, accepts trade-ins, and buys gold.",USA
New York,buy,Modern Nostalgia,"Modern Nostalgia is a cute women's clothing boutique owned by Nikki Polasik and Brianne Klejdys-Long, a pair of lifelong friends who are described on the store's website as ""Buffalo all-stars when it comes to style and fashion"". The ""style"" in question takes equal inspiration from elegant classic designs and exciting contemporary looks from up-and-coming designers — hence the name of the store — and makes the owners' infectious love of fashion all the more obvious. Customers adore ModNos — and forgive their somewhat high prices — because of their wide and changing selection of clothes (ranging from formalwear to more casual designs), lingerie, jewelry and accessories. The last two on that list are a particular specialty, with a massive range of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, handbags and clutches from collections by local and national designers, such as Pura Vida, Ornamental Things, and Made By Anatomy. As well, ModNos recently absorbed its erstwhile sister (brother?) shop, '''Blue Collar Buffalo''', and now stocks their line of rugged and masculine yet contemporary and stylish menswear under the same roof.",USA
New York,buy,Peek-a-Boo Baby Boutique,"The first thing a customer may think upon entering Peek-a-Boo Baby Boutique might be that for a storefront that looks so small from the outside and is so packed with merchandise, it has a remarkably airy, expansive feel, clean and cheerily decorated. Once that first impression is over, the customer may very well marvel at the large and adorable selection of previously-enjoyed items for children from newborns through toddlers — clothes, high chairs, bassinets, strollers, toys, and miscellaneous merchandise — all in impeccable condition. Most of the merchandise is consigned to the store by parents of growing children (call for details), but there are also some new items as well, much of which is the unique work of local designers. All items are 10% off after 5PM on Wednesday.",USA
New York,buy,P.S. Accessories,"P.S. Accessories boasts cute and fashion-forward clothes for all tastes, including plus sizes — but as the store's name implies, the star of the show here is the ample and ever-changing selection of jewelry, handbags, hairbands, leggings, belts, and other accessories, representing a style that encompasses diverse influences to suit all tastes, yet is distinctive and cohesive. The new items that constantly arrive at P.S. ensure that there's always a fresh slate of trendy items for shoppers to pore over. Best of all, the staff earns rave reviews for the friendly and helpful care they take of their guests, and the prices here can't be beat — the store's policy is never to charge more than $40 for any item!",USA
New York,buy,Richel Formalwear,"Luxurious yet affordable menswear is the order of the day at Richel Formalwear. With a skillful and genuine approach to customer service honed over more than a quarter-century of experience, owner Carmelo Bandinelli attends to Buffalonians in search of elegant men's formal attire such as tuxedos, dress shirts, vests, three-piece suits, shoes, and accessories such as hats, ties, and cufflinks. The owner himself performs each custom fitting with a trained eye to perfection that's unmatched in the area, and also offers customized tailoring and alterations including jacket tapering. Richel Formalwear doesn't leave the opposite sex out in the cold, either: wedding dresses, bridesmaids' gowns, prom dresses, and other formal attire for ladies are available for sale or rent.",USA
New York,buy,Cone Five Pottery,"Opened in 1998 on the West Side and moved to its current location four years later, Greg Link is the self-taught craftsman whose sculpture and handmade pottery can be found among the unique items for sale and on display in Cone Five Pottery's ample gallery space. The balance of the items here encompass works by over 50 artists from all over Buffalo and Western New York, in media as diverse as painting, jewelry, metal and wood art, photography, and blown glass, as well as occasional temporary exhibitions. In addition, open studio time for gallery members takes place at Cone Five every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday from noon till 9PM, and Donna Goeckel Martiny and Rachel Kofahl conduct pottery classes that range from basic skills like hand building, trimming and glazing to advanced techniques.",USA
New York,buy,Dana Tillou Fine Arts,"After over half a century operating out of a breathtaking three-story French Second Empire-style mansion in Allentown, Dana Tillou moved his gallery to a smaller space on Hertel, and with that move came a change in focus: away from 19th- and early 20th-century American and British paintings and furniture to more contemporary pieces in line with the tastes of a new generation of art and design aficionados. If you've just come to ""browse"", though, never fear: a somewhat more selectively curated variety of works by artists from Buffalo and the surrounding region are still displayed at his gallery-cum-shop, with locally famous names like Martha Visser't Hooft, Carlo Nisita, and Evelyn Rumsey Cary represented. As well, Tillou has over 47 years of experience in professionally appraising art and antiques for insurance, estate, or personal purposes.",USA
New York,buy,Local Color Gallery,"A small storefront boutique gallery operated by the legendary Michael Morgulis out of a section of his Hertel Avenue shop, '''New Buffalo Graphics''' ''(q.v.)'', the Local Color Gallery's exhibit space features brightly colored, pop art-style prints with almost a comic-book look to them, where local themes predominate and Morgulis' background in graphic design is on full display. Works can be purchased in-store or online.",USA
New York,buy,The Main Frame,"Opened in 1988 as a small art gallery and frame store at the heart of the Hertel Avenue corridor, The Main Frame is a sister shop to the venerable Vern Stein Art & Frame in Williamsville, and serves also as the production facility for the custom-made frames sold at both stores. The Main Frame boasts a large selection of prints on display and for sale, with antique prints featuring local scenes and themes a particular specialty. The Main Frame's staff has over 30 years of combined experience in custom framing, and really does a marvelous job at it.",USA
New York,buy,Meridian West Art Gallery,"A brand-new gallery opened in 2012 to great fanfare, Meridian West's owners, George Grace and Nancy Clarke Mariani, are both active members of the Buffalo Society of Artists and boast long and illustrious pedigrees in Buffalo's arts community (as a writer/artist and the chair of Lancaster High School's art department, respectively). Their work is on display and available for sale in Meridian West's airy, minimalist exhibit space, as are paintings, sculptures and mixed-media works by other local and regional artists such as Gary Wolfe, Ann Gunderman, and Rita Argen Auerbach. A small selection of gifts is available for those of a creative disposition. In addition, theatrical and musical performances, poetry readings, art and writing classes, and community events of all types are frequently held at Meridian West.",USA
New York,buy,State of the Art,"The credo here is, ""We may not be big, but we're small"" — and so it is at State of the Art, where the staff consists of Mar Penner Griswold, a certified picture framer with over 40 years of experience in the field, and her ever-present feline companion, Lucy. Since 1982, State of the Art has been a Hertel Avenue mainstay, with the store's website vaunting a full range of services including framing, frame repair, photographic repair and restoration, matting, glass replacement, and — yes — cat advice. Customers rave about Griswold's helpful advice on style and color, patient and sincere service to her clients, and fair prices.",USA
New York,buy,The Antique Lamp Company and Gift Emporium,"The Antique Lamp Company is where, since 1997, longtime antique aficionado John Tobin has offered for sale a full selection of antique and vintage lamps and light fixtures in 19th- and early 20th-century styles such as Victorian, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Mission, and Art Moderne. Western New York's only full-time, professional lamp restorer, Tobin's work in repairing and polishing these pieces to restore their former brilliance truly betrays the boundless love he has for what he does. A wide variety of fine china, timepieces, jewelry and accessories, flowers and gifts round out the offerings at the Antique Lamp Company. The cherry on top is the decor, whose opulent elegance extends to the soft music and subtle fragrances that delight customers as they shop.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo Antiques and Quality Furniture,"Dealing in a wide selection of wholesale antique furniture, timepieces, china, sterling silver, light fixtures, and decorative accessories, Buffalo Antiques is a massive emporium that's been in business on Hertel for over fifteen years. In addition to the antique items, which represent Victorian and 19th-century European styles through the Mid-Century Modern period, a variety of new furniture is also sold here: Buffalo Antiques is a licensed dealer of the Maitland-Smith and LaBarge brands. As well, these fine folks are always on the lookout for quality items to purchase, from single items to partial and total estate sale liquidations. Buffalo Antiques offers free estate sale consultations and fair-market appraisals of antique items.",USA
New York,buy,JM Gold Buyers,"This store's name is an unfortunate misnomer: though they will gladly purchase your unwanted jewelry, coin collections, ad nauseam, this is much more than just another sleazy old-gold dealer. The much more interesting half of the operation is built on owner John Marfoglia's nearly two decades of experience buying and selling at antique shows nationwide, which has put him in touch with some of the leading dealers and collectors in the United States. The fruits of those relationships are on full display in this Hertel Avenue showroom which was described by one satisfied customer as ""like the best parts of an estate sale were put together in a small shop"". Among the maddening diversity of antiques available here, specialties include weaponry including guns, knives and Japanese swords, ""modern vintage"" paintings, sculptures and other art, and Oriental rugs. Fans of the usual array of furniture, timepieces, light fixtures, jewelry and collectibles won't be disappointed either. JM Gold Buyers are also happy to provide you with a fair-market appraisal for your antiques (they even do online appraisals!) and manage your estate sales.",USA
New York,buy,Man Cave Outfitters of Buffalo,"If there were a competition for the store with the most accurate, short and to the point name in Buffalo, this place would win it hands down: simply stated, if you have a mancave and you need to outfit it, this is likely to be the first, last, and only stop you'll need to make. That's especially true if you're a beer fan, as the main focus of the inventory that owner Jonathan Gill has put together consists of antique collectibles from the golden age of Buffalo brewing: vintage neon signs, wall clocks, steins, ice chests, and bottle openers emblazoned with the old '''Iroquois''' and '''Simon Pure''' logos abound (if you're not familiar with or interested in those Buffalo brands of yore, never fear; they've got old-timey national-brand merchandise too). But that's only half the story: in partnership with the '''House of Jacob''' with whom they share the building, Man Cave Outfitters also offers a wide selection of restored vintage guitars and other musical instruments, and there's even a custom jeweler who practices his craft in a small nook in the back of the store. Prices are fair, and if you have a piece of antique ""breweriana"" of your own that you'd like to unload, Man Cave Outfitters can help with that too.",USA
New York,buy,Silent Voices,"Owner Frank Scheuttle has a long history in every aspect of the world of arts and antiques: well-versed in art history and theory thanks to his M.A. in American Folk Culture from the New York State Historical Association's Cooperstown Graduate Program, and tempered in the business side of the field with 40 years of experience as a collector, consultant, dealer, and museum curator. Silent Voices, his Hertel Avenue storefront and gallery space, contains a wide selection of artworks, quilts, crafts, and antiques on display and for sale that represent all facets of the Americana that is the object of his encyclopedic knowledge, boundless enthusiasm, and genuine love.",USA
New York,buy,WEBB Exchange,"Like '''Dana Tillou Fine Arts''' down the street, the WEBB Exchange is a place that's gone through a metamorphosis lately: it was in December 2015 that owners Matt and Kristeen Webb relaunched the art and antique shop they'd opened two decades earlier as '''Webb Trading Company''', with a newfound focus on high-end midcentury furniture, decorative baubles, and artworks sourced from the private warehouse in downtown Buffalo that serves as a clearinghouse for the pieces they acquire from estate sales and dealers around the country. And the ""high-end"" part cannot be overstated: among the designer furniture you'll find names like Saarinen, Eames, and Knoll, and they had an original Picasso painting for sale as of December 2015. If midcentury is not your style and you prefer the 18th- and 19th-century antiques of the old Webb Trading Company days, there's plenty of pieces like that to be found as well in the WEBB Exchange's 3,000 square feet (275m²) of floor space.",USA
New York,buy,The Second Reader,"The selection at this small used book shop directly across from the North Park Theater may not be the widest, but the Second Reader makes up for that with the quality of its merchandise and the friendliness and enthusiasm of its staff — not to mention the surprising and unusual finds that can often be encountered on the shelves there. The Second Reader's excellent prices are exemplified by the ""$1 Book Table"" which makes regular appearances in season on the sidewalk in front of the store. In addition to books, a range of prints, gifts and other ephemera are available here.",USA
New York,buy,Hertel-Parker Liquor Store,"Located at the corner of Hertel and Parker Avenues since 1988, the aptly named Hertel-Parker Liquor Store bucks the usual local trend of stores of this type: customers prefer the massive variety, range and quality of the liquors here to the more modest range of wines. Nonetheless, this independent business is renowned for the friendly and helpful staff that curates the selection. A sticking point among locals is that the owners seem to regard the opening hours as more of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule.",USA
New York,buy,Savory Sips,"Though she'd been thriving since 2011 at her original location in Lewiston, Savory Sips' move four years later to the more centrally located Hertel Avenue strip was a happy homecoming for owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter. Though casual passersby along the main drag might miss this place — it's tucked away behind '''Daisy's Doghouse''', with an entrance facing Norwalk Avenue — this charming European-style wine boutique is worth seeking out for the expansive selection of vintages on offer. Though the selection here spans every variety and geographic region imaginable, Savory Sips' is far from a kitchen-sink approach: all the wines Christie stocks on the shelves are individually selected, organic, small-batch vintages priced under $27 per bottle (more expensive wines, including some very hard-to-find selections, are available by special order on request). Matching the wide-ranging selection is Christie's encyclopedic knowledge of the products she stocks and of the wine industry in general, and she puts that knowledge to full use for her customers whether it be helping with a pairing or just talking shop with fellow wine lovers who stop in. The interior of the store is Christie's handiwork as well: with walls painted in rich, warm earth tones and a hand-built wine bar in the back, the space looks like Tuscany by way of Mexico. About the only weakness Savory Sips has is a disappointing selection of local wines, but do ask the owner about the group wine-tasting excursions to the Finger Lakes, the Niagara Peninsula, and other nearby winemaking regions that she offers through her side business, '''Village Wine Tours'''. Free public wine tastings are also held once a month; see the website for details.",USA
New York,buy,Village Beer Merchant,"A local business that's already well-loved and well-established in the Elmwood Village, this second location of the venerable Village Beer Merchant opened in 2012. To put it succinctly, this place is heaven for Buffalo beer snobs. As is perhaps obvious, the specialty here is a slate of brews that gives the perennial favorite local beer store, '''Premier Gourmet''', a run for its money: a dizzying gamut of imports, local and regional microbrews, and seasonal selections curated by a knowledgeable and friendly staff eager to direct customers toward the beer that's right for them. However, Village Beer Merchant's Hertel location does Elmwood one better with a full tasting room where customers can sample from among the many brews in stock. Vilage Beer Merchant is also a destination for those in search of a wide variety of gourmet specialty foods, with a range of artisanal cheeses, fine olive oils, chocolates, teas, Boar's Head deli meats and other charcuterie, and other upscale edibles.",USA
New York,buy,Al Noor Grocery,"Tasty Middle Eastern groceries of all types are the order of the day at Al Noor, with the crowded aisles of this little place fully stocked with everything from spices to Turkish coffee to canned vegetables to sheesha to a small selection of frozen foods. This stuff is the real deal, authentic and delicious — especially the halal meats that are the specialty here. Interestingly enough, British visitors will note that this is the only place in Buffalo that stocks '''Vimto''' soft drinks.",USA
New York,buy,Caramici's Bakery,"Though owner Diane Serra's brief experiment in running Caramici's as a full-service bistro is over, this longtime Little Italy institution remains renowned for the delicious desserts crafted by owner Diane Serra, a native Bostonian with over 18 years of experience as a pastry chef. ""Caramici"" in Italian means ""dear friend"", and the owner is fond of saying that everyone who walks in the door is treated like one — and around here, that's more than just a cute joke. Walk through that door and you'll immediately get the feeling of being in one of the charming little pastry shops in Serra's old stomping grounds of Boston's North End, then head up to the counter and be bowled over by the sight of delicious gourmet cakes creatively and expertly custom-decorated for whatever occasion you can think of (wedding cakes are a specialty). If you've got something smaller in mind, though, Caramici's still has you covered with a full slate of Italian pastries and sweets such as cannoli, tiramisu, biscotti, and — for an authentic taste of Buffalo you'll find nowhere else — even pastry hearts.",USA
New York,buy,Caruso's Italian Imports,"In the heart of Buffalo's Little Italy, appropriately enough, is found this delightful old-world food shop that seems to have been plucked from another time. Caruso's Italian Imports is a purveyor of delicious yet unpretentious imported foods which has earned more than its share of loyal customers over its 40 years of operation in North Buffalo. Found here is a myriad of delectable Italian specialties such as pasta, cheeses, olives and olive oils, fresh-baked breads, fine charcuterie such as prosciutto and mortadella, and fresh vegetables. The old-fashioned warmth and friendliness exuded by Caruso's employees is matched by the prices, which are among the lowest in town for specialty groceries of this type.",USA
New York,buy,Exclusively Alaskan Good,"Besides being a real ""live wire"", Earnest Thomas is a habitual truth-teller — stop in and you're as likely as not to be met with a greeting like, ""Hello, my name is Earnest, and I cannot tell a lie"". And that penchant for often blunt honesty extends to the name of the store: the seafood sold here truly lives up to the place's name, with only the freshest and highest-quality products delivered to Western New York courtesy of the connections he made during the 25 years he spent working as a seafood inspector for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation before returning in 2010 to open a seafood shop in his hometown of Eden, followed by this second location in North Buffalo six years later. If you're planning to pay a visit to Exclusively Alaskan Good, you might want to carve out a bigger block of time than normal — Thomas is a walking encyclopedia of edible marine life, and will regale you at interminable length with the minutiae of seemingly every piece of fish he sells, as well as tales of life on the high seas off the coast of Alaska, local political banter delivered with the opinionated tone you rarely find outside of small towns, and endless jokes as he packages your order. What's for sale? Salmon makes up a big part of it, all sourced from the wild and typically available fresh, smoked, canned, or ground into burger patties, as well as crabs, clams, scallops and other shellfish — or if you're not in the mood for seafood, check out what may be Buffalo's best selection of venison and game meats, with oddities such as elk steaks, caribou jerky, and alligator meat available for pretty good prices.",USA
New York,buy,The House of Olives,"Sandy Hofschneider spent many years working as a registered nurse in North Carolina; this brand-new Hertel Avenue storefront represents the second phase in her professional life, where her efforts at promoting the health and wellness of the community come through the sale of healthy extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars — and at great prices. Easily the most interesting products sold at the House of Olives are the flavored olive oils, where the imported extra-virgin oils that are also sold plain come infused with the delicious aromas of fresh basil, jalapeño, Meyer lemon, garlic mushroom, and more. Infused vinegars are also sold, with blackberry, raspberry, hickory, and chocolate among the available flavors. Best of all, customers are well attended to at the House of Olives, with the friendly owner always on hand to suggest pairings, share recipes, or — true to form — extol the myriad health benefits of extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars.",USA
New York,buy,Jerusalem Halal Market,"The west end of the Hertel Avenue strip has a growing cluster of ethnic food shops that all stock basically the same selection of Middle Eastern packaged groceries, frozen foods, and other goods. Jerusalem Halal Market is no different in that regard, but what does set it apart from the competition is the pleasant shopping experience: the store is clean and brightly lit, the merchandise is well-organized, the aisles are easy to navigate, and customer service is friendly and attentive. As well, Jerusalem has an in-house butcher that sells fresh meat (100% halal, like everything else sold here) several days a week; if it's closed when you stop in, there's always an ample selection of frozen meats. Rounding out the inventory is a relatively modest selection of fresh produce as well as hookah pipes, headscarves, and other Islamic clothing.",USA
New York,buy,Johnny's Meats,"Since 1960, Johnny's Meats has offered for sale a full range of meats, cold cuts, and cheeses, many of which are produced locally. Johnny's homemade Italian sausage, crafted with a secret blend of herbs and cheeses, is a specialty, but it's also just the beginning of the story — this real, old-fashioned butcher shop sells it all. Beef, lamb, bacon, veal, locally produced Sahlen's hot dogs, seafood, pork, poultry, and delicious homemade meatballs all keep Johnny's loyal customers coming back for more. In another nod to Hertel Avenue's status as the epicenter of Buffalo's Italian community, a small line of pasta products is also available.",USA
New York,buy,The Pasta Peddler and Blackbird Sweets,"Run by husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo, these founding tenants of the West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''' proved so immediately popular that, barely a year after opening, they'd outgrown their booth there and moved to Hertel Avenue, where they share the same (larger) space near the east end of the strip. The goods they sell are the same as always, though: Eric's stock in trade at the '''[http://www.pastapeddler.com Pasta Peddler]''' is gourmet goodies like imported olives and oils, balsamic vinegars in a variety of flavors, honey, and a selection of delicious artisanal fruit butters — and above all, as the name implies, a line of handmade gourmet pastas (including premade packaged ravioli to take home) and sauces. Linguine is a particular specialty; it comes plain as well as in a wide range of flavors such as spinach, jalapeño pepper, or tomato basil. As for Andrea's '''[http://www.blackbirdsweets.com Blackbird Sweets]''', a wide range of gourmet pastries are sold that deliver, in her own words, ""confection perfection and wow with every bite"". You can get cookies, muffins, pies, tarts, and lots of other home-baked delights at Blackbird, but the marquee product are cupcakes that come in a diverse selection of flavors — sugar cookie, salted caramel, and oatmeal chocolate chip are among the more interesting ones — crafted so artfully that one reviewer described being hesitant to bite into them. Consensus says that the cake has real heft to it and the frosting is not overpowering in its sweetness. And in the winter months, taking a cue from their former home at '''Horsefeathers''', the Amodeos team up to host the '''Winter Market on Hertel''', featuring local farmers and food artisans.",USA
New York,buy,Bella Mia Candy Store,"The name of the game at Bella Mia is rekindling the memories of nostalgic customers with ""retro candies"" from their childhoods. For sale here are old-school favorites like Laffy Taffy, Lemonheads, Necco wafers, and Abba Zabba chocolate bars, Cadbury and Mars candy bars that are imported from Canada and especially popular with customers from north of the border, and delectable oversize lollipops of the kind that will remind customers of a certain age of summers at Crystal Beach. Other confections such as licorice, chocolate truffles, and bubble gum are available as well — and what would a candy store in Buffalo be without a huge selection of sponge candy (available in half-pound, one-pound, and two-pound boxes)? An ice cream counter, coffee and cappuccino, and vintage gifts such as Beatles posters and old-fashioned metal Elvis lunchboxes round out the inventory here. Customers rave especially about Tom, the friendly, down-to-earth owner who always makes sure every visitor to Bella Mia leaves happy.",USA
New York,buy,Chow Chocolat,"Hertel Avenue is the latest setting in the long, itinerant saga of Chow Chocolat: owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz got his start in 2007 in the downtown Theater District, then bounced over to Elmwood for a few years, then to the basement of the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the West Side, and finally, in January 2015, to a former law office in the heart of the North Buffalo action. Though the location may have changed, Chow Chocolat's stock in trade is the same as always: small-batch chocolates and caramels artisanally handcrafted using the finest ingredients: milk from grass-fed cows on local farms, locally-sourced, organic and GMO-free fruits, and more. These delectable goodies, along with delicious house-blend coffees and hot chocolates (try the salted caramel!), are sold to you by an owner who clearly takes pride in his works and in the relationships he's cultivated with his loyal customers that have followed him in his game of musical chairs around the city. Prices are a touch on the high side, but again, you get what you pay for.",USA
New York,buy,Revolver Records,"In November 2015, Phil Machemer finally took the brisk business he'd done for a few seasons selling records on Saturday mornings and afternoons out of a stand at '''The Peddler''' on Elmwood Avenue and parlayed it into a brick-and-mortar store on Hertel in the former site of '''Deja Lu''' — and, in so doing, became the most recent piece of a mini-explosion of new record shops in Buffalo that's most welcome in the years after the demise of the venerable '''Home of the Hits''' and '''New World Record'''. As has become the rule among these new shops, vinyl is the name of the game at Revolver Records. On the racks in this pleasantly airy, brightly-lit space is a gargantuan yet carefully-curated kaleidoscope of some of the most interesting, obscure, sought-after, and above all, ''best'' music on the planet — over 15,000 titles spanning all genres and time periods from the 1950s to the present; everything from popular favorites to hard-to-find imports to offerings from Buffalo's local music scene, all accurately graded. There's a limited selection of music on CD and other formats too. Whatever interests you, be assured that Phil's encyclopedic knowledge of music is at your service — and if you're still not sure, Revolver provides a listening station where customers can listen to any record for themselves before purchase; a service that's unique in Buffalo. Revolver will also buy any old vinyl you might want to unload — a specialty here is entire collections in a specific genre — and prices are fair whether you're buying or selling.",USA

New York,buy,Modern & Ancient,"Modern & Ancient is a brand-new resale furniture shop located in a quiet setting a short walk off the beaten path of Hertel Avenue. The name of the business splits the difference between the store's two divergent focuses — also sold here are a variety of antiques of ancient vintage, with a special focus on pieces from Sub-Saharan Africa — but Modern & Ancient's bread and butter is a variety of mid-century furniture and home decor that represents the owner's 20-year collection of vintage items. Chairs, end tables, office furniture, accent pieces, and artworks are on offer, as well as large items such as sectional sofas that come in occasionally and are available at blockbuster bargains if you come at the right time. Modern & Ancient also deals in salvaged industrial furniture for aficionados of that aesthetic. Discounts are available for students as well as current and retired military.",USA
New York,buy,room,"Opened in 2005, room is a luxury furniture boutique situated in an airy, architecturally interesting showroom at the heart of Hertel. Described by one reviewer as ""a fantasy world of what my living room could be like"", in a pleasant ambience of scented soy candles and elegant chandeliers are placed a bevy of classic modern furniture, dinnerware, rugs, textiles, and other decorative elements and accessories. The brands room carries are not only stylish and cutting-edge, but are often locally manufactured and are united by a commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly production. Also on the same site is '''babyroom''', an outlet for contemporary baby items such as cribs, bunks, strollers and other accessories that, in the words of its website, ""epitomize 'baby cool'"". These items are high-end and priced accordingly, so come prepared to splurge — if not, sales and promotions do occur on a regular basis. As well, room's staff gets points for being friendly and helpful without crossing the line into pushiness or annoying overhelpfulness.",USA
New York,buy,Wrafterbuilt & Emerson James,"Two stores under one roof, these purveyors of furniture and home decor moved to the heart of the Hertel Avenue strip after a short stint in Allentown:",USA
New York,buy,Emerson James,"Custom lighting is the name of the game here — you may have seen Andrew Emerson's work illuminating downtown hotspots '''Toutant''' and the '''Big Ditch Brewery''' — and the house style is a smart and somewhat whimsical take on industrial chic. Chandeliers and desk lamps are crafted in deceptively simple designs using reclaimed metal tubing, with an end result that's almost worthy of hanging in an art gallery, yet you can also find new-material lamps and sconces done up in a delicious retro style.",USA
New York,buy,Wrafterbuilt Furniture,"Sean Wrafter first came to the attention of Buffalonians in 2014, when he turned heads as the designer and builder of the beautiful wooden bar at the newly minted downtown fine dining destination, '''Toutant'''. Today, along with his wife Jackie, he's in business in the heart of the local design district offering to the buying public the same caliber of custom-built furniture: high-quality, one-of-a-kind, locally produced pieces designed by Wrafter himself and sold at surprisingly affordable prices. The Wrafterbuilt aesthetic is simple and elegant, inspired by but not enslaved to the sleek modernism of the middle of the last century, and in all cases upcycled from locally-sourced reclaimed wood and other materials, the better to preserve the old-school quality of workmanship while helping reduce the environmental strain caused by demand for new materials. The interior of Wrafter's shop strikes a balance between art-gallery minimalism and rustic hominess, with abundant polished wood (appropriately enough!), and smaller decorative baubles bring out a whimsical touch — check out Wrafterbuilt's line of custom-refurbished axes and hatchets!",USA
New York,buy,Headin' to Hertel,"Though it plays perpetual second banana to '''Terrapin Station''' two blocks further down the drag, Headin' to Hertel is still an excellent source for tie-dyes, ""hippie""-informed clothing, accessories, and jewelry, incense, and other such goods. However, what really distinguishes this place is the selection of glass art it offers — Headin' to Hertel lays a strong claim to being Buffalo's premier glass gallery. Custom orders for glassworks are filled by Jason and Aaron, a duo of glass artists whose works are available exclusively through Headin' to Hertel, and a bevy of other pipes and other works of glass art are available in-store. Glass-blowing lessons are even offered periodically. Customers praise Headin' to Hertel not only for the impeccable quality of the products sold there and their friendly and knowledgeable staff, but also for their commitment to the glass art community in Buffalo and the surrounding region — all of the items sold there are made in the USA, and the majority are produced locally.",USA
New York,buy,Terrapin Station,"Since 1988, Buffalo's premier head shop has been encouraging locals of all stripes to (in the words of the radio spots that are all over the local airwaves) ""stop in and say hi"". A wide-ranging gamut of tobacco products, t-shirts and other clothing, tie-dyes, jewelry, incense and body oils, and new-age gifts such as crystals and tarot cards are available at Terrapin Station, all united by that distinctive aesthetic familiar to those who are still on that ""long strange trip"". Perhaps not surprisingly given the store's name, Terrapin Station is also Buffalo's foremost source for Grateful Dead-themed merchandise; concert tickets are also sold. Best of all, this eclectic selection is curated by a friendly, mellow staff that goes above and beyond to ensure that customers are well taken care of and have a pleasant shopping experience.",USA
New York,buy,Germa's African Hair Braiding,"As the name suggests, hair braiding and extensions are the main order of business at Germa's. However, a secondary attraction at this friendly brownstone storefront is a wide variety of African-themed clothing, jewelry, decorative items, gifts and knickknacks, as well as African movies on DVD. Bath and body products are a specialty here — including imported shea butter, body oils and incense — and likewise for authentic artisanal items such as masks, baskets, objets d'art, drums and musical instruments. Clothing for men, women and children in brightly-colored tribal prints is also on offer at Germa's. The hours of operation are particularly convenient as well — this place is open six days a week, and relatively late.",USA
New York,buy,Maria's Italian Gifts,"Operated for over 25 years by owner Maria Pileri, Maria's Italian Gifts is a one-stop shop on Hertel that deals in high-quality goods imported from Italy, including fine Capodimonte-style porcelain, crystalware, objets d'art including carved decorative items in Argento 925 silver and imported wood, greeting cards, figurines and baubles, and other gifts. The specialty here, however, is ''bomboniere'' (wedding keepsakes) — visitors to Buffalo who are looking for the perfect wedding gift, invitations, or the like, or unique gifts for other occasions such as baptisms, bridal or baby showers, or anniversaries, can scarcely do better than Maria's.",USA
New York,buy,New Buffalo Graphics,"New Buffalo Graphics offers a range of items — t-shirts, prints, cards, mugs, and miscellaneous gifts — united by their local focus. If you want to commemorate your visit to Western New York with high-quality merchandise emblazoned with icons of buffaloes, photos of beloved Buffalo landmarks like the Peace Bridge and the gone-but-not-forgotten H-O Oats grain elevator, and catchy slogans all the locals can recite by heart (in fact, one of Buffalo's most enduring nicknames, the ""City of No Illusions"", originated as a slogan on a New Buffalo Graphics t-shirt), this is the place for you. All the designs are the work of the friendly owner of this longstanding Buffalo institution, Michael Morgulis, whose knowledge of the ins and outs of Buffalo is matched by the enthusiasm of his love for his hometown.",USA
New York,buy,Daisy's Doghouse,"Named by owner Lisa Samar after her beloved dog, pet supplies for the dog lover is the name of the game at the Hertel Avenue storefront previously home to '''Floral Explorations'''. Daisy's Doghouse is an independently-owned specialty boutique carries a full line of natural, holistic, and often locally-sourced products that are priced competitively with mass-market big-brand items: everything from leashes to shampoos to bowls to organic, filler-free dog foods and treats from brands such as '''Fromm''' and '''Wild Callings'''. All this is available to browse in a brightly-painted, well-lit retail floor that also serves as space for the puppy training classes the store puts on.

The yarns here tend toward the high-end and are priced accordingly, though bargain hunters will be pleased with the selection in the sale bins. All this curated by a staff that earns rave reviews for the helpful and informative service they provide to, and the friendly rapport they have with, their loyal customers.",USA
New York,buy,Love Light & Magick,"Now in a new location near the west end of the Hertel strip, Kurtlyn Cunningham's ""metaphysical and eclectic shoppe"" is a source for an array of unusual goods that are otherwise impossible to find in the local area. A self-described ""eclectic witch"" interested in spirituality from a young age, Cunningham opened Love Light & Magick on New Year's Day 2015 and immediately made a splash, offering ritual items and supplies for a Buffalo pagan community that is larger than most locals realize. Practitioners of a diverse array of spiritual traditions, from Santería to Wicca to Voodoo to Buddhism to American Indian spirituality and everything in between, are served with a smile. The inventory comprises candles, offering bowls, essential oils, incense resins, tarot cards and boxes, crystal balls, runestones, and altar clothes, all united by a focus on positivity and searching for harmony with the earth — and goods are locally sourced whenever possible. More than that, though, Love Light & Magick is also a place to go for psychic readings, meditation classes, reiki sessions (on Friday and Saturday nights), seminars on spiritual topics, and even art shows. Staff is friendly and helpful, and unlike many small businesses in the local area, Love Light & Magick's long hours are convenient for those who work during the day.",USA
New York,buy,Shickluna Bikes & Darts,"A testament to the high-quality goods available here is the fact that Shickluna Bikes & Darts has been in business since 1899 — opening only a year after Rick's Cycle Shop in Allentown, the second-oldest independent shop of this kind in the U.S. Some of the best bikes in existence today — especially Giant brand bikes, of which Shickluna is a licensed dealer — are displayed for sale in the ample showroom, with models available for everyone from families and everyday cyclists, to enthusiasts of mountain and off-road biking, to professional racers. All bikes are assembled onsite by a professional bike mechanic and come with a year of free adjustments and flat-tire repair. Shickluna also doubles as Buffalo's premier dart shop, with soft- and steel-tip darts and boards by such brands as Dart World and Harrows. Customer service at Shickluna can be indifferent, but the products sold here are of the highest quality and the prices can't be beat.",USA
New York,buy,Six Nations Herbal Remedies,"The centuries-old tradition of Iroquois herbal medicine is the name of the game at this new Hertel Avenue shop owned by Mark Okwahotekakahrake Jamieson (""Eyes of the Wolf""), a full-blooded Mohawk who is learned in the old traditions and keen on passing them down to the next generation of Natives as well as Buffalonians in general. At Six Nations Herbal Remedies, there's seemingly a plant, root, flower, or tea for every malady — and if you can't find one for what ails you, just ask Mark and he'll put in an order. The store's decor is minimalist and all business, with monochrome walls lined with row after row of jarred herbs as well as jewelry, artwork, musical instruments, dreamcatchers, and other crafts handmade by local Amerindian artisans — all watched over by a large stuffed bear, the keeper of herbal medicine according to Iroquois tradition. Six Nations also plays host to educational workshops regarding Iroquois culture and spirituality, with an emphasis, naturally, on traditional medicine (and free tea usually available!)",USA
New York,buy,Virgil Avenue Tobacconist,"The Virgil Avenue Tobacconist's slogan proudly declares it to be ""where the city smokes"", and if local renown is a measure of quality, that's hardly an exaggeration. This one-stop shop just off Hertel offers everything the Buffalo smoking enthusiast could conceivably desire: imported cigarettes, pipes and pipe tobacco, rolling papers, loose cigarette tobacco, and — the main draw — a dizzying range of premium cigars shipped directly from factory to store. Ashton, Hemmingway, Arturo Fuentes, and Cohiba are only a few of the many brands to be found in Virgil Avenue's massive walk-in humidor. Also part of the package is the Rocky Patel Lounge, a cigar lounge with a large-screen HDTV, beverages including a complimentary coffee bar, and club-style seating for up to 20 people.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo's Own Apparel and Footwear,"Opened in July 2016 on Kenmore Avenue just a door down from the corner of Delaware, this men's and women's urban clothing boutique is owned by Joshua Barnes, a hardworking, ambitious aspiring rapper with a passion for helping the local African-American community achieve prosperity through entrepreneurship. Aside from the streetwise fashions he stocks at Buffalo's Own — t-shirts, ladies' tops, the latest in Nike and other name-brand sneakers, jeans, skirts, handbags and other accessories — Barnes also plans to open an on-site recording studio for local hip-hop and R&B artists.",USA
New York,buy,Flying Anvil Metalworks,"If you've followed your GPS from Hertel onto Botsford Place, you might think you've taken a wrong turn — Flying Anvil Metalworks is located in an anonymous brick industrial building in West Hertel, surrounded by warehouses and big-rig parking lots. But appearances can be deceiving: inside, you'll find a bevy of unique, custom-made furniture, collectibles, architectural and interior elements, and ''objets d'art'' fashioned by owners Mollie Atkinson and Kenny Kash out of steel, copper, brass and aluminum. They'll work with you to fashion your own metal-art masterpiece whether it be functional or strictly decorative, or you can browse their ample selection of antique and collectible metal art made by others. Flying Anvil even does double duty as an exhibit space where local metal artists display their works.",USA
New York,buy,Queen City Wine & Liquor,"The much-ballyhooed Queen City Wine & Liquor may have only opened in August 2014, but it has already earned rave reviews for the great variety of wine and spirits that fill the shelves of its ample, warehouse-like interior — ranging from the basics to delightful oddballs like handmade, gluten-free craft vodka — at prices that are among the best in town. As well, the staff here keeps their ear to the ground and eagerly accepts suggestions from their growing customer base for new vintages and liquors to stock. Aside from that, you'll be struck by how unintimidating Queen City Wine & Liquor is: unlike some other liquor stores, this place is clean, airy and well-lit, and the staff is as friendly and helpful as can be.",USA
New York,buy,Scime's Sausage,"Scime's Sausage is an old-style meat market that's been sating hungry Buffalonians practically forever. Though a full range of meats is on offer at their butcher's counter, the specialty here is the homemade Italian sausage that owner Salvatore ""Sam"" Scime crafts daily from high-quality, specially-purchased pork shoulders, to which is added a blend of herbs, spices and flavorings including black pepper, fennel seed, fresh parsley and Romano cheese. As well, a range of Italian groceries is offered at Scime's that includes imported cheeses, olives, produce, pasta, and fresh, locally-baked Luigi's bread.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo LUV,"Buffalo LUV relocated in 2015 from its original digs in Allentown to off-the-beaten-path West Hertel, but other than that the story remains the same. The marquee item here is glass pipes and other ""functional art glass"" blown before your eyes by master artisan Matthew Lazzaro, but that's really only the beginning of the story: there's glass sculptures, custom-made Christmas ornaments, and a variety of other glassware produced in-house by ""Lazz"" or elsewhere in the local area by other Buffalo-based artists, as well as antiques aplenty. These are some high-quality pieces crowding the shelves on the sales floor; the offerings trend heavily toward early- and mid-20th-century handpainted furniture and quirky decorative tchotchkes.

New York,buy,Couture Boutique,"At this new University Heights fashion boutique on Main Street next to '''Pamela Inc.''', the name of the game is elegant, high-fashion formalwear including dresses, gowns, accessories and jewelry. Couture Boutique doesn't just sell clothes, though — they also do alterations, with quick service to boot. Needless to say, this is a popular place around prom season.",USA
New York,buy,Greeks & Sneaks,"Greeks & Sneaks is not only a place for UB students to purchase or rent textbooks (at prices much more reasonable than the on-campus bookstore and sometimes even cheaper than Amazon), but it also doubles as a one-stop shop for all manner of college-themed clothing and gear. Dedicated UB football and basketball fans can find a full range of t-shirts, sweats, hoodies, and other items emblazoned with the Bulls logo. Greeks & Sneaks also offers fraternity and sorority swag, as well as silkscreen prints, embroidery, and a wide range of sneakers.",USA
New York,buy,O'Connell's,"O'Connell's is a family-owned and operated clothier whose ambience is redolent of an earlier time in retail, featuring merchandise crafted with pride and skill and sold to the public by helpful salespeople dedicated to building friendly and lasting personal relationships with their customers. High-end men's formalwear is a specialty at O'Connell's; the suits, sportcoats, dress shirts, shoes, slacks, ties and accessories offered here are of a style that is a unique combination of staid conservatism and quirky individuality (witness, for example, cufflinks shaped like race cars and champagne bottles). Free alterations are provided with purchase, and O'Connell's also offers a range of women's wear and items for young men. Prices tend toward the higher-end, but you get what you pay for.",USA
New York,buy,Pamela Inc.,"The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique may be small, but — as hinted at by the impeccable effort put into the fabulous window displays looking out onto Main Street — the selection here is vast, diverse, and constantly changing. The clothing at Pamela Inc. is characterized by fun, sassy fashions with bright colors and a chic urban style, but it's the selection of accessories that really distinguishes this place: handbags, belts, jewelry, scarves and sunglasses — and above all, what may be the city's best selection of women's hats — all take a prominent place among the merchandise at Pamela Inc. All major credit cards are accepted, as well as PayPal for online orders.",USA
New York,buy,Iron Crown,"Iron Crown may play perpetual second banana to its neighbor further up Main Street, Queen City Bookstore, but this smaller, more out-of-the-way comic store makes up for that with its reasonable prices, customer service that is arguably even more friendly and personable than Queen City's, and — above all — a full range of supplies for players of Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and other card games. Iron Crown also sells a variety of toys and collectibles.",USA

All titles are 20% off on Sundays and come with a free bag and board.",USA
New York,buy,Talking Leaves Books,"In business since 1971, Talking Leaves Books is Buffalo's oldest independent bookstore. To quote from the store's website, the name Talking Leaves ""derives from a recurrent conceptualization of books by peoples who were unfamiliar with print; book pages were seen as 'leaves' that 'talked,' imparting wisdom and knowledge and spirit... an intriguing way of keeping track of the treasures of the people: their minds and their ways of being in, and understanding, the world."" True to that philosophy, offered here is a vast selection of the sort of books that expand people's consciousness, with an especial emphasis on unusual and oft-neglected topics. But what Buffalonians love most about Talking Leaves is the staff, who take sincere pleasure in customer service whether it be special-ordering books not currently in stock, making interesting recommendations, or attending to any problems customers may have. Talking Leaves is a true Buffalo gem.",USA
New York,buy,Parkside Candy,"A Buffalo institution since 1927, the Parkside Candy Company is the oldest and one of the largest locally-owned manufacturers and purveyors of fine candies in the area, distributing its products nationwide (including sponge candy, the local specialty that serves as their signature product). Though Parkside Candy operates five retail stores all over Erie County, the original location in the former '''Henkel Building''' in University Heights is the one that's nearest and dearest to Buffalonians' hearts. Walking into Parkside Candy is like stepping into another time, with a full range of chocolate truffles and cordials, peppermint patties, fudge, old-fashioned lollipops, and specialty items such as chocolate-covered popcorn and pretzels merchandized amid an Art Deco interior with Adamesque flourishes (designed as a conscious imitation of French confectionery stores) and the classic black-and-white checked tile floor.

Gift baskets are available, as well as online orders.",USA
New York,buy,Record Theatre,"Record Theatre is one of the only locally-owned record stores remaining in Buffalo today, which some might say is reason enough in itself to stop in.

Record Theatre will also purchase your used CDs or specially order from their distributors any title that is not in stock. 20% off all merchandise on Saturdays before noon.",USA
New York,buy,Winspear Liquors,"Don't be fooled by the name: Winspear Liquors is actually located at the corner of Lisbon Avenue, not Winspear! That aside, this new store opened in December 2012 and has quickly become the place to go in University Heights for a wide variety of wines and spirits, comprising local, national and international vintages including chilled and sparking varieties. Prices can be a bit high at Winspear Liquors, but the variety is surprising. New York Lottery, Mega Millions, and Powerball tickets are sold as well.",USA

Music City's staff is also happy to provide fair-market appraisals on a wide variety of instruments.",USA
New York,buy,New Age Creations,"It might be a bit misleading to describe New Age Creations as a ""head shop"", exactly — the ambience here is a good deal more ""mainstream"" than a place like '''Terrapin Station''', with an emphasis on quirky gifts rather than tobacco, glass pipes, and the like. Still, New Age Creations is a great place for modern-day flower children to find '60s-themed tchotchkes such as incense, lava lamps, and the like. A variety of tie-dyes and other apparel is also on offer.",USA
New York,buy,Speaker Shop,"""All Roads Lead to Speaker Shop"", so the slogan goes; the handsome store on Main Street just past the University Plaza that is one of Western New York's foremost destinations for high-end home stereo and theater systems, digital audio systems, headphones, speakers, and all manner of audio, video and media equipment. Customers praise the knowledgeable and pressure-free (if not always friendly) service provided by Speaker Shop's non-commissioned sales staff, who are on hand to direct customers among their slate of state-of-the-art, audiophile-grade products to the choice that's right for them.

New York,buy,Gino's Italian Bakery,"Thankfully, though it moved in 2011 from its longtime location on the corner of Hertel and Saranac, nothing has changed about the homemade sweets and other baked goods with which Gino's Italian Bakery has enchanted Buffalonians for so long. A huge variety of authentic Italian pastries (try the ''pasticiotti'', a perennial favorite among Gino's customers), delectable Italian cookies such as ''cuccidiati'', ''giugiuleni'', and Italian wedding cakes, and pastry platters and full-sized cakes for special occasions are all available here. Fresh, tasty loaves of Italian and French bread baked in-house, as well as what may be the best authentic tomato pie in the city, round out the selections at Gino's. The authenticity of the Italian bakery experience is matched by the prices, which really can't be beat.",USA
New York,buy,White's Baby and Teen Furniture,"Western New York's oldest and largest store specializing in children's furniture, White's Baby & Teen Furniture was founded in 1939. It's that longevity in business that has enabled the staff here to not only select a wide range of high-quality products for all budgets, but to answer pretty much any question a customer may have about their products, make recommendations, special-order items that may not be in stock, and generally provide service that is among the most exceptional around. White's vast expanse of showroom space spans three floors and is jam-packed with items that cover the whole gamut — baby furniture and cribs, car seats, strollers, playpens, children's beds, dressers and armoires, lamps, and the list goes on.

New York,buy,Nick's Sporting Goods,"What's available at Nick's is not the usual array of baseball bats and mitts, tennis rackets, and other such things. Though it dubs itself a ""sporting goods store"", this small, jam-packed North Buffalo storefront might be better described as a surprisingly comprehensive outdoor goods shop, with a full range of gear for hunters, fishermen (including live bait!), and sport shooters. That's all a prelude to the real raison d'être of Nick's, however, as Buffalo's premiere archery store. Not only does this place sell the best state-of-the-art archery gear, but customers can also come to Nick's for free adjustments to their bow, reasonably-priced repairs, and a comprehensive slate of archery lessons and New York State bowhunting education courses — a complete range of supplies and services for the Buffalo archer delivered by a staff that is friendly and knowledgeable.

New York,buy,Black Squirrel Distillery,"Opened in February 2015 as the first of a glut of new craft distilleries set to open in Buffalo in the ensuing months, Black Squirrel Distillery is the brainchild of Jason Schwinger, otherwise known as the founder of '''BFLO Harbor Kayak''' and part-owner of '''Silo City Rocks!''' on Ganson Street. Black Squirrel is one of a very few producers of rum in New York State, and the only one in the country that uses maple syrup as the main ingredient rather than cane sugar — a peculiarity that was borne of the requirement that New York-based craft distillers source 75% of their ingredients from within the state, though no sugarcane is grown that far north. The end result grafts a subtle yet distinctive maple finish onto the flavor of what is otherwise a rather traditional amber rum. All the rums produced by Black Squirrel are handcrafted in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; distilled in a traditional copper-columned pot still then aged in oak barrels, the old-fashioned way. In the same vein, Black Squirrel also produces an unaged, 90-proof distilled spirit they call ""mapleshine"" — essentially what backwoods distillers would call ""sugar shine"", except with maple syrup in place of sugar. The small retail shop/tasting room is set up in the style of a speakeasy, an homage to Schwinger's great-grandparents who ran one on this very corner during Prohibition.",USA
New York,buy,Great Arrow Wine and Liquor,"Since 1995, owner Wayne Riggs has operated this conveniently located Delaware Avenue liquor store that has scored points with Buffalonians for in terms of customer service — the staff at Great Arrow Wine and Liquor is not only warm and friendly, but supremely helpful and knowledgeable, able to answer any question their customers may have or suggest the perfect product for their needs. Manager Randy Kozlowski, in particular, is the man to see for anyone who has questions about food pairings. The selection here is a dizzying range of both domestic and imported wines, as well as an equally wide variety of vodka, rum, whiskey, gin, tequila, brandy, and cremes and liqueurs (the selection of the latter, in particular, is perhaps the best in Buffalo), at prices that are reasonable though not dirt-cheap. Wine tastings occur at Great Arrow every Friday, and Thursdays feature a ""create your own wine 6-pack"" option, where customers can make a selection of six of any of the wines in stock for a 15% discount.",USA
New York,buy,Carriage Trade Pastries,"Carriage Trade Pastries is a charming little bakery founded in 1998 by Shandra and Andy Beutner and situated on Elmwood Avenue in the shadow of the old '''Pierce-Arrow factory'''. The staff here is not only uncommonly skilled in designing and baking some of the best cakes and pastries in Buffalo, but utterly friendly and accommodating to their customers' individual needs. In addition to supplying desserts to some of the finest restaurants in the Buffalo area, Carriage Trade's retail store is a great place to pick up delicious pastry items made from scratch, such as cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, muffins, sticky buns, scones, and more, all at prices that are surprisingly affordable given their quality. Pies, cakes and other specialty items are available too, but as this is a small operation that custom-designs all their cakes, these must be ordered at least a day in advance. A lunch counter is also present where a few light items such as soups, meatless chili, and quiche are on offer.",USA
New York,buy,Gatti Jewelers,"This small, friendly neighborhood jewelry store has been on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street since 2003. Gatti Jewelers' selection of bracelets, necklaces, earrings, watches, and other pieces is curated by an owner whose knowledge of gold and silver jewelry is encyclopedic. As well, Gatti does an impressive side business dealing in used musical instruments as well as accessories such as amplifiers. Estate sales are also handled.",USA
New York,buy,International Wine & Spirits,"Located on up-and-coming Main Street in the Vernon Triangle in a spacious, newly-remodeled storefront that was once home to the fabled '''Stuffed Mushroom''' restaurant, International Wine & Spirits stocks a selection of award-winning wines from the local region and around the world, as well as premium branded liquors such as whiskey, brandy, cognac, tequila and rum. Local connoisseurs love the quality of products available here for very reasonable prices — this place is well-known for taking full advantage of manufacturers' rebates from their distributors — but what's most notable about International Wine & Spirits is the breadth and diversity of their inventory. Service with a smile is the rule here, and International Wine & Spirits also hosts occasional wine tastings and other events.",USA
New York,buy,Illos Piano Restorations & Music Center,"It's doubtful that a traveler would come to Buffalo specifically to avail themselves of the thing that is this company's primary raison d'être — tuning, rebuilding, and restoring pianos — but dedicated musicians might be interested in knowing that Illos also sells a wide variety of new and high-quality used pianos from such brands as Yamaha, Steinway, Firth & Hall, and Goulding, as well as harpsichords and player pianos, and can arrange to have them transported from their shop on Main Street in Central Park to anywhere in the United States. If not, Illos also sells a full line of beautiful, 36-inch hardwood piano benches in a variety of finishes, accessories such as piano covers and wheel and tripod casters, and — best of all — a ''huge'' selection of sheet music. Illos has been in business since 1961, and their reputation is such that they have sold or restored pianos for clients as prestigious as the Chautauqua Institution and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, as well as dozens and dozens of Western New York high schools and colleges.",USA
New York,eat,Bertha's Diner,"Bertha's, which according to its slogan is ""the diner that takes you back a few years"", is a '50s-style affair that's located right next door to the North Park Theater. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and till 8PM on Fridays, Bertha's serves standard diner fare at unbeatable prices. The lunch menu is dominated by standard fare — burgers (monikers of selections such as the ""James Dean"", the ""Davey Crockett"", and the ""Buddy Holly"" continue in the '50s theme), club sandwiches, and similar items, as well as salads, wraps, and simple entrees. Full breakfasts comprise delicious omelettes, egg sandwiches, buttermilk pancakes and ""Buffalo's best Belgian waffle"", and weekly specials are offered. Cash only.",USA
New York,eat,Block's Restaurant,"Bucking the trend on Hertel (and all over Buffalo) toward ever more creative and upscale dining, the menu at Block's — which opened its doors in October 2015 at the former home of '''Allegro''' in the old '''Sample Building''' — is a good sight more down-to-earth than its predecessor. The name of the game here is classic pub grub and good old-fashioned American comfort food, but please don't confuse the small size and simplicity of the menu with indifference to quality: this place does what it does with panache. At lunchtime, chef-owner Michael Rottger cooks up a mean reuben, crispy and piled high with corned beef and fixin's, as well as an out-of-this-world French onion soup and a slate of burgers that's the one section of the menu where creativity reigns supreme (the ever-changing Burger of the Day would do Bob Belcher proud), while the ""California chicken"" platter (grilled with avocado and tomato and smothered with melted provolone) is the most popular of the somewhat smaller range of full-size dinners served Thursday through Saturday. Service is unfailingly professional and attentive, and if it's a nice day why not enjoy your meal on Block's breezy sidewalk patio?",USA
New York,eat,Bob & John's La Hacienda,"A newly remodeled dining area boasting several high-definition flat-screen TVs which are inevitably tuned to the big game (this place is understandably popular during Bills and Sabres seasons) is the setting where patrons of Bob & John's La Hacienda enjoy simple yet delicious items such as subs, wraps, burritos, a small selection of salads, pizza, and stromboli. A particular specialty at Bob & John's is the chicken wings, which come in a wide variety of delicious sauces including classic Buffalo, barbeque, Cajun, and Jamaican jerk (boneless ""wingdings"" are also available). A modest range of simple entrees, comprising mostly pasta dishes as well as a locally renowned fish fry that's available on Fridays, is also on offer; at lunchtime, a buffet is offered featuring pizza, soup and salad.",USA
New York,eat,Café on the Avenue,"At the former home of '''Sister's African Cuisine''', an interesting but ultimately failed experiment in acquainting Buffalonians with Liberian food has given way to one of the best breakfast joints on Hertel. The aptly named Café on the Avenue hops during the morning hours with a full menu of breakfast sandwiches and burritos (huge!), omelets, pancakes, French toast, and egg-and-breakfast meat platters, but the flagship item here is homemade donuts, prepared by what is proudly cited as ""the first Donut Robot in the Buffalo area"" and available in quite a few more varieties than you'll find at your average Tim Hortons or Dunkin' Donuts. At lunchtime, the slate of options transitions into classic American diner fare: no surprises on the menu, but everything's reliably good. Service can be hit-or-miss, but the price is right, plus the ambience is a solid improvement over the old days of Sister's: the reconfigured interior is spacious and airy, and the kitchen is open, with all the food prepared freshly before your eyes.",USA
New York,eat,Gramma Mora's,"Owned for over 30 years by the Mora family, Gramma Mora's has been a mainstay of Hertel Avenue since it moved here in 1996. Despite the legions of Buffalonians — including reviewers for ''Buffalo Spree'' and ''Artvoice'' — who sing the praises of this place's pleasantly mediocre Tex-Mex fare, it is undeniable that Gramma Mora's has been going steadily downhill for the past ten years or so. Still, the food is far from bad, and even by Buffalo standards, the portion sizes are very generous for the price.",USA
New York,eat,House of Hummus,"House of Hummus launched in the summer of 2016 in the former home of like-minded establishment '''Manakeesh & More''', and quickly took a place near the top of the echelon of the Middle Eastern restaurants and specialty grocers that have clustered around the west end of the Hertel strip. This family-owned eatery is headed by Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties, and the keys to House of Hummus' greatness are time-tested old-world cooking techniques and flavors that are intricate, well-balanced, and above all, authentic. The menu is not the most extensive in the world, but it covers all the bases: the twin centerpieces are the titular chickpea dip (large platters come topped with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and — optionally — shawarma meat) as well as what the owner describes as ""Western New York's fluffiest falafel"" (the fluffiness is due to the absence of pine nuts, and the indelible aroma of fresh parsley elevates it a cut above what you can get elsewhere in Buffalo). For main courses, chicken and beef shawarma is the most popular item on the menu, marinated overnight in a mix of red wine, vinegar, olive oil, and a secret blend of spices and topped in a delicious house-special sauce; gyro, shish kebabs, and a variety of salads are also on offer. As you might imagine, vegetarians and vegans will find an uncommonly ample range of choices, and if you're not in the mood for Middle Eastern food, they also make a mean Philly cheesesteak. Portions are generous, service is attentive and brimming with old-fashioned friendliness, and the restaurant itself is clean but small, with only a few tables in the dining room (thankfully, take-out and delivery are offered).",USA
New York,eat,Joe's Deli,"Joe's Deli is the brainchild of Joseph Lyons, and is located in the handsome brick storefront on the corner of Hertel and Colvin that was formerly home to '''Mastman's Kosher Deli''', a longstanding, iconic linchpin of the formerly burgeoning Jewish community in North Buffalo (the old Mastman's sign is still perched above the corner entrance). Though the business hasn't stayed completely true to its predecessor — this food isn't Kosher, and traditional Jewish sandwiches such as corned beef, pastrami, and Reuben are joined on the menu by a range of other sandwiches such as muffaletta, Cuban, and a concoction of grilled vegetables and herb cream cheese on a hoagie roll dubbed the Johnny Be Good — the emphasis on freshness and flavor at Joe's has inspired many locals to name it as the purveyor of the best deli sandwiches in Buffalo. Most interesting of all, however, are the wraps, whose variety is truly striking: a Thai chicken wrap, a Greek wrap consisting of feta cheese, olives, and fresh vegetables in Greek dressing, and a hummus wrap are among the offerings.",USA
New York,eat,La Kueva,"A small family-run restaurant with a modest menu, La Kueva nonetheless made a big splash in May 2013 when it became the latest in a long list of multiethnic eateries to chip away at the official designation of Hertel Avenue as Buffalo ""Little Italy"". Owner Luis Martinez's desire was to bring the subtle, delightful flavors of Puerto Rican cuisine out of the barrio and into the larger Buffalo restaurant scene; in a recent write-up on buffalo.com, he remarked: ""My people... already know about [Puerto Rican] food. I want to attract the Italians, the white people of North Buffalo and introduce them"" to it. La Kueva is already receiving rave reviews from Buffalonians for its take on Hispano-Caribbean favorites like pollo guisado, pastelones, and various tropical drinks, but for less adventurous diners, a range of sandwiches is available as well.",USA
New York,eat,Lone Star Fajita Grill,Lone Star Fajita Grill has been a North Buffalo institution for what seems like forever. Simple but excellent Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes at prices that can't be beat (nothing on the menu costs more than $3!) are served up at this sparsely decorated dive at the east end of the Hertel Avenue strip. Cash only.,USA
New York,eat,Shish Kabab Express,"A simply magnificent place to eat. Buffalo's first Iraqi restaurant, Shish Kabab Express serves all the standards of Middle Eastern cuisine — shawarma, falafel, tabbouleh — as well as unusual specialties unique to the cuisine of Iraq, such as quzi and Iraqi-style kebabs. As well, Shish Kabab Express stands out among the crowd of similar places at the west end of Hertel by offering a small range of South Asian specialties such as beef and chicken tikka. The food here is fresh and authentic, with 100% halal meat, and all the bread served at Shish Kabab Express (including the samoon, a staple of Iraqi cuisine) is baked fresh on the premises. The kicker is the prices, which, according to one reviewer, are often ""cheaper than a fast-food combo meal"".",USA
New York,eat,Belsito,"Striking a blow for the continuing Italian-ness of Little Italy — which is being gradually eroded by the diversification of dining options on Hertel — is Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip. Belsito's website loudly trumpets their ""unique foods made from Italian cured meats and cheeses"", which is an accurate description of its modest-sized, decidedly ""lunchy"" menu. A range of appetizer salads and cheese-and-cold-cut plates are on offer, the latter of which are served with fresh homemade bread and side salads, but the bulk of the menu consists of a mouth-watering selection of sandwiches and panini featuring various combinations of imported Italian charcuterie and cheeses of impeccable quality. Call the menu a one-trick pony if you want, but Belsito sticks to what it does well and earns raves from local foodies as a result. To drink is a dazzling selection of imported Italian wines, reputedly the best in the city, but the equally expansive beer list includes only a few imports — it's given over mostly to craft beers from regional microbrewers such as '''Southern Tier''', '''Ellicottville''', the '''Brooklyn Brewery''', and Buffalo's own '''Flying Bison''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. Best of all, Belsito is far less crowded than it ought to be, which makes for excellent service and ample opportunities to chat up the friendly, ever-present owners.",USA
New York,eat,CRāVing,"Situated at the heart of the Hertel strip at the former location of '''La Dolce Vita''', CRāVing is a brand-new restaurant operated by Jennifer and Adam Goetz. Fans of the Goetz's former restaurant, Allentown's sadly missed '''Sample''', will feel right at home here, with a creative menu whose accent, appropriately enough for ""Little Italy"", is on fresh and creative interpretations of Italian cuisine, including delicious homemade pizza. That's not to say that Italian food is CRāVing's sole focus by any means — selections here are as diverse as the German-inspired entrée of pork belly with mustard caviar and rye spätzle, and appetizers such as lobster poutine (!) and buttermilk-fried chicken with grits and sautéed collard greens. Lunch is a more easygoing affair, with a huge sandwich board hanging proudly on the wall.",USA
New York,eat,Jewel of India,"Given that Jewel of India is run by the same people who own '''India Gate''' on Elmwood Avenue and '''Taste of India''' in Amherst, patrons of this brand-new addition to the Hertel Avenue strip can expect the same healthy, high-quality fare here as at those other fine establishments. Jewel of India boasts an extensive menu featuring beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and vegetarian entrees; diners enjoy their meal in a lovely, spacious, and impeccably decorated dining room. Lunch and dinner buffets are also available.",USA
New York,eat,Kostas,"Of Buffalo's many, many Greek diners and family restaurants, Kostas has one of the most interesting and extensive menus. Since 1977, Kostas Family Restaurant has been serving familiar standbys such as souvlaki, gyro, and Greek salad, as well as harder-to-find Greek specialties such as ''tirokafteri'' and ''taramosalata''. Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and other such fare is also on offer, as is a modest selection of wines.",USA
New York,eat,La Tavola Trattoria,"""Tavola"" in Italian means ""table"", and as the owners of La Tavola Trattoria like to say, ""there's always something good on the table"". The storefront at 1458 Hertel didn't miss a beat after the closure of longtime neighborhood fixture the '''North End Trattoria''' in late 2012, with its new owners setting up shop here not long afterward. La Tavola differentiates itself from the myriad other Italian restaurants on Hertel with a Creole-fusion style that owners Victor Cali and Pat Gentile refer to as ""New Orleans Italian"", with entrées such as shrimp, sausage and chicken in Cajun cream sauce over homemade pasta combining several meats and diverse flavors for a result that's often bolder and spicier than traditional Italian fare. The pride of La Tavola, their expensive 100% wood-fired pizza oven, turns out not only delicious homemade pizzas (which tend more toward the traditional Italian side of the spectrum, perhaps more so than any other place in Buffalo) but also other specialties such as stuffed peppers. Sandwiches and burgers are also available in an ambience that is airy, modern, and impeccably decorated.",USA
New York,eat,Lloyd Taco Factory,"Lloyd's rise to the top of the Buffalo food truck heap was so meteoric that it was perhaps inevitable that they'd follow it up with a brick-and-mortar restaurant: in the five years before this über-popular Hertel Avenue spot's 2015 opening, Lloyd went from launching a struggling operation serving a citizenry who barely knew what food trucks were and where their legal status was uncertain, to a local culinary institution in a town where '''Mighty Taco''' long ruled the roost when it came to Mexican food. The ""high-end food and service at street-level prices"" credo under which Lloyd's trucks operate applies equally to the Taco Factory: the menu combines a curated selection of the most popular options from the truck (now if you want your fix of Tricked Out Nachos or the ""Dirty South"" dessert burrito, you know exactly where to find it on any given day) with some interesting new creations (the ""El Hombre"" quesadilla is probably the most popular of these, with chorizo lending a smoky aroma to a cheese-based filling that also includes potato, onion, and avocado crema, while the ""Mexicali Spring Rolls"" sees Lloyd dabbling in Asian fusion, stuffed with a cheese and mushroom mixture spiced up ever-so-slightly with charred poblano pepper with two different sauces for dipping). No matter what you order, you can be sure that it's done up right: everything is made with free-range, antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and locally grown produce and served on house-made corn tortillas made through the traditional ''nixtamalization'' process, the only restaurant between Chicago and New York City that does this. There's also a full cocktail bar with the best selection of mezcal in town, plus a wealth of specialty cocktails that are a bit pricey but worth it. It bears emphasizing that this is one of the most popular new restaurants in Buffalo — waits of over two hours for tables are not uncommon at peak days and times, and reservations aren't accepted, so maybe save Lloyd for when you're hungry outside of normal lunch or dinner hours.",USA
New York,eat,Mac's,"Bucking the trend toward the upscale that Hertel's dining scene (and that of Buffalo as a whole) has seen lately, this new spot in the former '''Empire Grill''' is unpretentious and unabashedly party-oriented — with loud, thumping Top 40 music on the stereo, a huge oval bar ringed with big-screen TVs, and a menu consisting of largely of familiar pub grub with some local twists. At Mac's, you can indulge in some pretty well-executed burgers and hot sandwiches, chicken wings that tend to be a bit spicier than normal, and a range of ""Trash Plates"" — their Buffalo-ified version of Rochester-style garbage plates, with '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters taking the place of '''Zweigle's''' white hots, and '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard taking the place of the regular yellow stuff. If you're a bit hungrier, there's also a small selection of full-size mains that bring out a more refined touch: various steaks and chops including a chicken-fried Delmonico, fish and chicken dishes, and a Thai noodle bowl with your choice of meat. Mac's is a pretty huge place — with two floors of seating, you can take your pick of a view of Hertel Avenue out the picture windows at street level, a bird's-eye perspective of the revelry below on the upper balcony, and a pleasant second-floor patio that rivals the '''Pearl Street Brewery''''s in size and provides a welcome respite from the thundering din inside — and the impeccable service is more befitting a luxurious black-tie restaurant.",USA
New York,eat,Més Que,"Opened in April 2012 with a name that echoes the slogan of FC Barcelona, Més Que is the first establishment of its kind in Buffalo: a sports bar and restaurant dedicated entirely to soccer. The owners of Més Que, whose other businesses around town include the longstanding West Side fine dining destination '''Left Bank''', have been fans of Buffalo's NPSL club since its foundation, and the state of affairs at this official soccer bar of FC Buffalo is lively and crowded — never more than during one of the soccer matches shown frequently on the flat-screen TVs behind the bar. You'll swear you were in Europe. The menu is small in size but outstanding in quality, with elegant pizzas, panini, pasta dishes, cheese and charcuterie plates, and heartier entrees that represent the cuisine of the Mediterranean, and Spain in particular. Even more impressive are the offerings at the bar, with a wine list of impressive size and a beer selection that draws heavily on imports and local and regional microbrews.",USA
New York,eat,Public House of Buffalo,"In 2014, when Frank and Sara Testa were finally ready to strike out on their own after years spent working their way up the rungs of the Buffalo restaurant scene, they happened upon the Hertel Avenue storefront most recently occupied by the short-lived '''Canvas @ 1206''', and the Public House of Buffalo was born (just in time for the Italian Festival that year!) They really did a spectacular job remodeling the place, installing a bar whose top is made from wood salvaged from wharf piers that were excavated during the construction of '''Canalside''' and hanging works by local artists on the wall for a finished product that's cozy yet airy, classy yet unmistakably pub-like. What's served at the Public House of Buffalo is, first and foremost, a huge selection of beer, available on draft as well as in cans and bottles — microbrews dominate some 80 entries on the beer list, including locally-produced craft beers from '''Flying Bison''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. If you're overwhelmed by all the choices, never fear: the bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable about their stock, and will be more than happy to point you in the right direction. As for the food, they describe it as ""elevated pub fare"" — classic bar food kicked up a notch with creative gourmet twists. For example, chicken fingers come milanese style and are served with a side of pesto aioli — and what would a Western New York bar be without chicken wings, tossed in barbeque or classic Buffalo sauce as well as options like Sriracha sesame sauce or '''Chiavetta's''' marinade. Owner Frank's roots as a Chautauqua County farm boy come out in his emphasis on locally-sourced farm-to-table produce, so if you're in the mood for a salad, expect to see seasonal ingredients and enjoy farm-fresh flavors.",USA
New York,eat,Romeo & Juliet's Caffe and Bakery,"The owners of Romeo and Juliet's are a family of first-generation immigrants who have many years of experience working in genuine Italian bakeries and kitchens, and with this charming restaurant that's been open on Hertel since 1998, they've recreated that experience to the delight of Buffalonians who flock here to enjoy light Italian fare such as pizza, panini and simple entrees, and a range of fresh, flavorful appetizers. The menu is filled out with such delightful selections as a wide and interesting gamut of salads and bruschettas and a small range of pasta dishes; the panini are especially good, a slate of delectable and creative options whose names, appropriately enough, are tributes to some of the great painters of Europe (check out the Picasso, described on the menu as ""an artwork of prosciutto crudo, soppressata, capicolla, salami and mozzarella""). Also, don't forget to visit the bakery, where cannoli, gelato, tiramisu, and other marvelously prepared Italian pastries and desserts are sold.",USA
New York,eat,The Sterling,"The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' was reborn in July 2015 under new ownership — namely Kevin Brinkworth, also known as one of the duo behind Elmwood Avenue's ever-popular '''Blue Monk''' — and there are more than a few cues taken from the Blue Monk experience at this brand-new North Buffalo destination. For instance, the popular duck fries appetizer — hand-cut French fries cooked in duck fat — was imported lock, stock and barrel from Elmwood, and the several dozen local and regional craft beers available on tap and in bottles mines much the same territory as well. However, by and large the focus on the menu here is not the Belgian and Northern French gastropub fare that's Blue Monk's stock in trade, but rather an eclectic selection of homemade, gourmet sausages. Featured sausage selections at The Sterling change periodically, but typically include such offbeat, exotic ""rare game"" blends as wild boar with cranberry and red wine, smoked bison with Burgundy and thyme, and duck with foie gras and Sauterne wine. Elsewhere on the small but impressive menu is a slate of combo platters of locally-produced, somewhat less hoity-toity (but still delicious) '''Wardynski's''' sausages with various toppings and sides, a selection of mac & cheese mains with a variety of toppings, and familiar yet well-executed pub grub such as wings, sandwiches, and burgers, the latter of which are especially accoladed. Perhaps most impressive of all, though, are the renovations that have been done here: far from the dank dive it used to be, The Sterling of today boasts a fully redone interior decorated with a copious collection of antique ""breweriana"" and mementos from the Brinkworth family's nearly century-long tenure in the local restaurant industry — check out the 1901 Ludwig & Company piano that was originally commissioned for the Pan-American Exhibition, and the circa-1890 back bar that the owner purchased from the hosts of the A&E television series ''American Pickers''.",USA
New York,eat,Ristorante Lombardo,"At the center of the action on Hertel Avenue, Ristorante Lombardo calls their food ""the best Italian in Buffalo"", a claim that is hard to refute given the extensive menu of elegant and authentic Italian dishes served to patrons in a setting that is among the most exquisite and upscale on Hertel. Ristorante Lombardo boasts a full bar and patio and an expansive wine list.",USA
New York,eat,The Globe Market,"The Globe Market is a delightful combination café and specialty food shop that is committed to offering a wide range of fresh, locally sourced products. An eclectic variety of gourmet salads, soups and sandwiches are made from scratch daily. Personalized gift baskets are also sold at the Globe Market.",USA
New York,eat,North Buffalo Farmers' Market,"What was once a dream in the mind of Buffalo locavore Patricia DiFrancesco Banning has now come to fruition: the North Buffalo Farmers' Market kicked off in 2014 with an impressive range of organic fruits and vegetables, breads and baked goods, artisanal pasta, coffee, organic honey, fresh-squeezed juices and delicious smoothies, and even bath and body products — all grown or manufactured locally. This is a true community partnership, with the Hertel-North Buffalo Business Association lending its support and a myriad of local businesses, including North Buffalo's own '''House of Olives''' and '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', turning out weekly to sell their wares. Best of all, you don't have to get up early on a weekend morning to attend — the market runs on Thursday evenings, perfect for folks looking for a healthy and affordable alternative to another restaurant dinner.",USA
New York,eat,Winter Market on Hertel,"You can take Eric and Andrea Amodeo out of '''Horsefeathers Market''', but apparently you can't take Horsefeathers out of the Amodeos: just a few months after moving to their new joint location on Hertel, the owners of '''The Pasta Peddler''' and '''Blackbird Sweets''' sought to replicate a wintertime institution at their old home on Connecticut Street by welcoming to their ample retail space a small but diverse range of Western New York farmers and artisans, anchored by the Pasta Peddler and Blackbird Sweets themselves, which stay open for business during market times. At the Winter Market on Hertel, you can get everything from locally-raised meat, dairy, eggs and greenhouse produce to jams and jellies, baked goods, bath products, and even gourmet dog treats and hand-crocheted plush toys and accessories — at a time of year when most farmers' markets close up shop. Caffeinated pick-me-ups are also available courtesy of '''Public Coffee'''.",USA
New York,eat,Frank's Sunny Italy,"Hearty, unpretentious Italian meals at a reasonable price are the stock in trade of Frank's Sunny Italy. Though the menu is not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination, familiar Italian standbys such as veal parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, and pizza keep Buffalonians coming back for more. Portions are notoriously massive at this family-style Italian eatery.",USA
New York,eat,The Kitchen Table,"The Kitchen Table moved in July 2014 to a larger location in West Hertel, but otherwise it's the same deal as before: they still serve up classic, unpretentious, all-American comfort food in a downhome atmosphere described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as ""a mix between a greasy spoon and a country kitchen"". Burgers (served with heaping sides of fresh-cut fries that customers rave about), club sandwiches, fish fry, and multitudinous flavors of Turkey Hill ice cream can be had, but the Kitchen Table's true claim to fame is their hearty, homestyle breakfasts, which are served all day. The staff here really goes out of their way to please, and they treat customers like family.",USA
New York,eat,Linda's Café and Smoothie Bar,"Linda's is where the West Side meets North Buffalo both literally and figuratively: this humble little storefront in West Hertel does double duty as a place to get not only a variety of healthy and delicious upscale smoothies and protein shakes, but also some of the tastiest and cheapest homestyle Puerto Rican food in town. Let's talk about the latter first: the menu includes not only all the usual suspects like ''bistec encebollado'', ''pernil'' (the specialty of the house), and ''tostones'' (fried crispy and with a flavor that boasts a delightful hint of garlic), but also several harder-to-find specialties you can't get anywhere else in Buffalo, like octopus salad and ''piononos'' (breaded and fried sweet plantains stuffed with a ground beef-and-potato mixture). As for the smoothies, they're carefully constructed concoctions where a large variety of fruits, berries, herbs, and other ingredients carefully chosen for their health properties are mixed, blended, and infused together to delicious results. Best of all, the folks at Linda's are dedicated to the community they call home: when they're not serving their delicious food to diners at the restaurant (for, it should be noted, great prices), they're just as likely to be catering a community event or giving it away for free at a local homeless shelter or food bank.",USA
New York,eat,Sophia's,"This humble establishment operated by Sophia and Sam Ananiadas serves some of the best (and biggest) breakfasts in Buffalo — so good, in fact, that they caught the attention of celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who dedicated a segment of his Food Network series ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" to the place. In addition to the usual lineup of pancakes, omelettes, French toast and the like, the Mediterranean flair of Sophia's cuisine is on full display in the giambotta, their signature breakfast platter of eggs, home fries, homemade Italian sausage, peppers, onions, and garlic. For lunch, an array of burgers, club sandwiches, and salads are on offer, as well as what may be the best souvlaki in Buffalo. Best of all, customers rave about the genuine warmth and friendliness of Sophia's staff that keeps them coming back.",USA
New York,eat,Taj Grill,"Though it's located in one of the sterile, monotonous plazas that line Delaware Avenue north of Park Meadow, the Taj Grill lauds itself as ""the finest Indian restaurant in Buffalo"". Though that claim is certainly up for debate — opinions seem to be divided evenly between this place and the Elmwood Village's '''India Gate''' — customers unanimously praise Taj Grill's extensive menu, which boasts a huge selection of all the traditional curries known by lovers of Indian cuisine available with chicken, beef, lamb, seafood, and even tofu and goat, as well as myriad options for vegetarians. The food here caters more to the Indian palette than the Americanized version of the cuisine available elsewhere in the region, to the delight of traditionalists. Best of all is the service, which is unfailingly friendly and upbeat.",USA
New York,eat,Tokyo II Japanese Seafood and Steakhouse,"Tokyo II is Buffalo's newest hibachi steakhouse and Japanese restaurant. Steak, seafood, rice, and other entrees are prepared for diners before their eyes on the hibachi in an entertaining spectacle. In addition, a wide range of sushi and sashimi is available, as is other Japanese fare, a small selection of Thai entrees, domestic and imported beers including Kirin, Asahi, and Sapporo, wine, and sake.",USA
New York,eat,Amy's Place,"A popular dive where the latest indie tunes can be heard on the soundsystem and people-watchers can enjoy a clientele that trends heavily toward bohemian urbanites and other alternative types (not to mention students of UB's nearby South Campus), Amy's Place is among the hippest eateries on Main Street. By day they serve a range of Lebanese and other Mediterranean fare of respectable quality, including abundant options for vegetarians and vegans. However, Amy's Place is perhaps best known for their substantial, delicious and reasonably priced breakfasts. Cash only.",USA
New York,eat,Doctor Bird's Caribbean Rasta-Rant,"This humble take-out (with a few tables for indoor seating) offers what is by far and away, without a doubt, the best Jamaican food in Buffalo. The jerk chicken, rotis, curry goat, and oxtail are all simply fantastic, and are universally served with a side of fried plantains and rice and beans. Wash your food down with a bottle of strong ginger beer. Reggae, calypso, and soca records are also for sale at the counter.",USA
New York,eat,Dosa Place,"Amherst's '''Palace of Dosas''' may have flown under the radar of the local restaurant scene, but even so, lots of local aficionados of South Indian cuisine were disappointed when it closed in 2013. They can rest easy: its owner Nick Emmanuel, a Sri Lanka native now in the midst of his third decade in the local restaurant industry, has reemerged at the '''University Plaza''' with the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor. Said menu is comprised of 100% vegetarian fare — one of the few places in the Niagara Frontier that can make that claim — prepared fresh everyday from all-natural ingredients. The place's namesake, and the star of the show, is the ''dosa'': Dosa Place serves about two dozen different variations of this light, airy lentil-based crêpe, either plain with butter or stuffed with various fillings such as onions, potatoes, ''paneer'' cheese, or vegetables, as well as a mix of spices. ''Utthappam'' also make an appearance, the dosa's thicker, doughier cousin that's been described as an ""Indian pizza"", with onions and other ingredients baked right into the crust. Rounding out the menu are a range of spicy vegetable curries, ''naan'' and ''chapati'' breads, and (as appetizers) battered vegetables, ''pakora'', ''iddly'' (fluffy rice- and lentil-based buns with various toppings and spices), and ''vadai'' (savory doughnut-shaped lentil fritters). Best of all, prices are a good sight lower than they were at Palace of Dosas, which themselves weren't too bad.",USA
New York,eat,Eddie's Chophouse,"In July 2015, when passersby on Main Street started to notice chicken and duck carcasses hung up in the front window where '''Slice of Italy''' used to be, it became clear that a new type of business had arrived in University Heights. Former UB student Eddie Liang opened Eddie's Chophouse in his old stomping grounds near the South Campus because he felt the time was ripe for Buffalonians to sample a new permutation of Chinese food, and what better spot for the big launch than in the thick of the vibrant Asian and Asian-American community gathered around the university? Eddie's is the first restaurant in Buffalo to serve ''siu mei'', or Chinese barbecue — a Cantonese culinary tradition where meat is coated in a seasoning sauce and then slowly rotisseried, bone-in, in a Chinese smoker — and your choices here are pork, duck, chicken, or spare ribs, served either over steamed white rice or as a soup with your choice of macaroni or rice or egg noodles. (If you opt for soup, further ingredients become available: steamed wontons, fish balls, and beef tripe.) A limited range of other selections are also offered, along with a wide selection of hot and cold teas to drink as well as iced mint lemonade, which might be the most popular item Eddie's serves. The pint-sized menu and spartan (if pleasant) interior are made up for by quality and value — the meat served here is fresh and bursting with flavor and comes in huge portions that make the low prices charged that much more spectacular. Eddie's also offers delivery at no charge for orders of $20 or more.",USA
New York,eat,Kalypso,"Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant may not have had its Grand Opening until February 2013, but it's already earning rave reviews among locals. Located just off Main Street in the former '''Fast Frank's''', Kalypso serves up a range of Caribbean specialties that is surprisingly ample given the relative humbleness of its appearance from the outside. Among the usual suspects — jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail — can be found several delectably prepared selections available nowhere else in Buffalo, such as brown stew chicken, Jamaican pepper steak, and escoveitch fish. A small selection of vegetarian options is also offered.",USA
New York,eat,Lake Effect Diner,"The Lake Effect Diner is a '50s-style affair located in one of the last remaining ""diner cars"" in America, carefully restored under the direction of local restaurateur Tucker Curtin. With oldies on the jukebox and waitresses dressed in '50s-style pink skirts, the Lake Effect Diner is as authentic as it gets. Decent diner fare — burgers, club sandwiches, french fries, milkshakes and malts — is available here for reasonable prices. The Lake Effect Diner has been featured on Guy Fieri's Food Network television series, ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"".",USA
New York,eat,Venus,"Located in the University Plaza, Venus is a friendly restaurant serving simple Greek and Lebanese foods. By comparison with '''Amy's Place''', University Heights' better-known, longer-standing Mediterranean restaurant, at Venus most of the bohemian ambience is sacrificed, but is made up for with food that, on the whole, is a good deal tastier than the sometimes lackluster fare served at Amy's. Shawarma, falafel, shish kabab and kofta, and gyros are available as either platters or wraps, and delectable Greek salads and fatoush are available for those in search of greener options (tabouli is on the menu as well, but never seems to be available). Though a good deal of the business done here is take-out or delivery, those enjoying their food at one of Venus' handful of tables are treated to a neverending stream of delightfully cheesy Lebanese music videos on the satellite television — a part of the Venus experience that's as integral as the food itself, in this author's opinion.",USA
New York,eat,May Jen,"Owned since 1981 by the Leung family, and before that for some time in a previous incarnation on Elmwood Avenue, May Jen is the oldest continually operating Chinese restaurant in Buffalo. Though extensive, the menu is not what you would call groundbreaking — the entree of prawns with glazed walnuts, a dish unique to May Jen, is the only eye-catcher in a sea of kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, General Tso chicken, and other standards. But the ambience is serene and pleasant, prices are reasonable, and the quality of the food is high enough for ''Artvoice'' readers to have voted May Jen the Best Chinese Restaurant in several annual ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' polls. Beer and wine are served.",USA
New York,eat,Ming Café,"Make no mistake about Ming Café — from the exterior it may look like just another unassuming hole-in-the-wall in University Heights, but what is served here is high-quality, gourmet Chinese food that is priced accordingly. Ming Café's menu is dominated by interpretations of classic Chinese standards — Szechuan chicken, kung pao shrimp, moo shu pork — that are fresh, flavorful, and prepared to order with an uncommonly refined elegance. The hot and sour soup is particularly good. But it's in the ""signature dishes"" section of the menu where Ming Café's true culinary stars come out to shine — a diverse array of delectable upscale options that can be best described as ""Asian-influenced"" rather than a strict interpretation of Chinese cuisine. The icing on the cake is the huge selection of authentic imported Chinese teas, as well as a variety of coffee. Cash only.",USA
New York,eat,Sato Ramen,"Opened in fall 2015, the satellite location of Satomi Smith's somewhat eponymous Elmwood Avenue noodle shop is actually a solid improvement on the original, with a considerably expanded selection of noodle bowls and small plates on the menu (they make up for this by not including any sushi or sashimi, as at Elmwood), and a youthful, funky vibe that's much more suited to its college-student clientele than the trendy but staid original location. At Sato 2.0, the three flagship ramen selections of the original restaurant are joined by Buffalo Chicken Ramen (the titular meat with corn, scallions, carrots, and black garlic oil in chicken broth), as well as Kimchi Ramen in a mixed pork and chicken broth. ''Donburi'' bowls and Japanese curry are also offered, but the pièce de résistance on the small plates section of the menu is the huge appetizer of Okonomiyaki Fries — sort of a Japanese take on poutine, smothered in mayo and ''okonomiyaki'' sauce and topped with dried bonito flakes, ''nori'' seaweed, green onions, and pickled ginger. There's a short drink list that prominently features local and regional craft brews as well as a variety of different sake selections, and for dessert there's green tea or ginger ice cream courtesy of Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''.",USA
New York,eat,Shango,"Though bouillabaisse, crawfish, po' boys and bananas Foster feature prominently on the menu, it would be a disservice to pigeonhole the lovely bistro run by owner and head chef Jim Guarino as simply a ""Creole"" or ""Southern"" restaurant. Instead, the cuisine offered at Shango is as diverse as it is high-quality. Additionally, the wine list is one of Buffalo's most extensive and has been honored with an award by ''Wine Spectator'' magazine; a carefully selected variety of import beers and microbrews is also available at Shango.",USA
New York,eat,The Steer,"The Steer is best known for its sometimes rowdy bar frequented by students from the nearby South Campus of the University of Buffalo, but let's not forget that it is also a restaurant that serves pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and — as the name suggests — mouth-watering steaks and chops. The Montana Room, located on the second floor of this unmissable Main Street landmark, is a banquet room equipped for up to 60 guests.",USA
New York,eat,Curry's,"Those who are expecting Indian cuisine will be disappointed — there's nothing exotic about the menu at Curry's. Rather, the sandwiches, entree salads, meat and pasta dishes served up here match the workmanlike reliability evoked by the humble exterior of this Kenmore Avenue restaurant. What ''is'' special about the heaping portions of classic American comfort food offered up at Curry's is the friendliness with which it's served — this is a real ""where everybody knows your name"" type of place — and its surprising quality, if not creativity. Beer-battered fish fry, a well-known Buffalo specialty, is served with aplomb on Friday nights.",USA
New York,eat,Yummy Thai,"Opened in 2013, the second location of Yummy Thai has a menu that's identical to the original restaurant in North Tonawanda, but at a much more convenient and centralized location. Here you'll find the usual lineup of Westernized Thai dishes that Stateside fans of the genre are familiar with — ''pad thai''; red, green and ''penang'' curries; ''pad kee mow'' and ''tom yum'' soup for those who like it spicy (unlike many Thai places, Yummy Thai doesn't blandify the food for the American palate; when they say ""spicy"", they mean it!); chicken and beef satay as appetizers. Portions are ample, but the quality of the food is as middle-of-the-road as the selection. If you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat, though, you're not completely out of luck at Yummy Thai, especially if you peruse the house-special stir fry mains. These aren't the most authentic things in the world, but they make up for it with creativity: the ""Peanut King"" features mushroom, bell peppers, baby corn, broccoli, and napa cabbage in a light peanut sauce, and in the ""Healthy Garlic"" the same vegetables are combined with fresh garlic and served in Yummy Thai's special garlic sauce; these along with most entrees are served with your choice of meat, seafood, or tofu for vegetarians. If you're in town on a busy Friday or Saturday night and don't feel like arriving at a restaurant for dinner only to wait an eternity for a table, the perennially uncrowded Yummy Thai may be the place for you, but don't expect that to necessarily translate into fast or attentive service, which is a weak spot here.",USA
New York,eat,Sinatra's,"The scion of a family that traces its roots back to Vallelunga, Sicily, John Sinatra opened his eponymous restaurant in 1981, serving family recipes handed down from generation to generation. Originally named '''Sinatra's Trilogy''' in honor of John's three sons who helped him run the business, the name was shortened to ""Sinatra's"" when the middle son, Michael, took ownership after his father's retirement. Though Sinatra's has remained true to its original dedication to delicious Sicilian and Southern Italian food, over the years it has become more known as an upscale destination serving an increasingly refined interpretation of that cuisine. A wide range of pasta dishes are on offer, made with fine ingredients imported from Italy; the pasta con sardi is an interesting choice in this regard, topped with fresh sardines, tomatoes, raisins, fennel and pine nuts. A range of seafood dishes is also available at Sinatra's, as well as chicken and veal served in milanese, marsala, piccata, parmigiana or diavolo style. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the wine list: a gargantuan slate of offerings that features whites, reds and reserve selections from Italy, France and the United States. Buffalonians absolutely rave about this place.",USA
New York,eat,Ashker's at the Park,"Opened in July 2014 on the site of the former '''Juicery''', the Delaware Park branch location of '''Ashker's Juice Bar''' (operated in conjunction with Dan McCormick of '''Santora's Pizza''' and the ubiquitous Mark Goldman) has proven to be an instant hit with joggers and bicyclists on '''Meadow Drive''' as well as golfers at the '''Delaware Park Golf Course'''. The Elmwood Village flagship location's menu of juices and smoothies are expanded on with a selection of gourmet sandwiches and salads whose names pay homage to the Buffalo oeuvre of Frederick Law Olmsted, the renowned landscape architect responsible for Delaware Park. For instance, ""The Bidwell"" sees ham, salami and cappicola piled onto a baguette and topped with provolone, roasted red peppers, cornichons, arugula, and homemade vinaigrette, and ""The Cazenovia"" is a classic Greek salad with red onions, tomatoes, feta, and Kalamata olives. As for the juices and smoothies, they're culled from the best and most popular of the offerings at the originbal Ashker's — yes, this includes the Zinger and the basil lemonade — and filtered water is offered free of charge to all. Best of all is the verdant ambience: there are few things in Buffalo more relaxing than sipping on a cold drink on these shady picnic benches, with the panoramic expanse of the Meadow in front of you.",USA
New York,eat,Vino's,"Vino's is a small restaurant, easily missable and in a fairly out-of-the-way location, with a limited menu and seemingly never open — and Buffalonians can't get enough. They crowd into the place whenever it's open, and many of them call it the best Italian restaurant in the city. Why? Simply put, what is served here is authentic homestyle Italian cuisine that is absolutely delicious and available for unbelievable prices. Entrees emphasize pasta dishes; particular favorites among Vino's regulars are the spaghetti with pesto sauce, lobster ravioli, and the spicy ""Charles diavolo"". Appetizers and desserts are equally lauded, and true to the restaurant's name, a small but delightful selection of wines and sangrias are also on the menu. But perhaps the thing about Vino's that is loved most warmly by locals are the owners, Kathleen and Tony, who truly go the extra mile to ensure that guests are welcomed and attended to with the sincerest regard.",USA
New York,eat,Nye Park Tavern,"With Nye Park Tavern, owner Mark Hutchinson — otherwise famous for his somewhat eponymous Delaware Avenue fine dining destination, '''Hutch's''' — takes his signature upscale template and adapts it to pub grub, with a local twist of course. There are no real surprises on the menu, but you'll sure get one when your food comes out: the quality of the ingredients and presentation are head and shoulders above what you'll get at your average Buffalo gin mill (for instance, the ""steak in the grass"" sandwich is a full-size New York strip smothered in fresh-cut, unprocessed provolone), which goes a long way toward justifying the price point. The signature item at Nye Park Tavern, though, are the so-called ""West Side spare ribs"", a smoky concoction inspired by the ones served at the long-gone '''Arkansas Lounge''' off Grant Street. The interior's been spiffed up nicely, too, while retaining the cozy homeyness of '''Papa Jake's''', which preceded it in this location.",USA
New York,eat,Oliver's,"""Fine Dining in the Old-School Tradition"" is Oliver's credo, and true to form, it is one of the most elegant restaurants in Buffalo, with prices to match. With myriad different permutations of Continental cuisine present on the menu, Oliver's is a foodie's dream come true, with veal milanese, strozzapreti, and foie gras torchon among the most popular delicacies on offer. The wine list is, to quote the restaurant's website, ""deeper than deep"". Oliver's also prides itself as one of Buffalo's best caterers.",USA
New York,eat,Fairy Cakes,"Located right across the street from the '''Buffalo Zoo''' and a couple doors down from '''Sweetness 7''', Fairy Cakes Cupcakery is a cute little café that features a fireside lounge and a cupcake bar and that differentiates itself from Buffalo's other cupcake outfits with flavors that are even more creative than its competition (their ""Pancakes and Bacon"" cupcake is topped with maple buttercream and real bacon, and their ""Original Buffalo Hot Wing Cake"" is a seductive marriage of rich chocolate and spicy cayenne pepper), a selection of ""adults only"" cupcakes whose recipes incorporate rum and other alcoholic ingredients, and, interestingly enough, a beverage selection which includes no fewer than 30 varieties of loose-leaf tea. A modest selection of other desserts are available. The consensus on Fairy Cakes is that the cupcakes are not quite as rich and flavorful as Firefly's are, but if nothing else, this place is worth a visit if only to experience the whimsical decor: an almost dollhouse-like setup in cheery pastel colors, you'd expect nothing less from a place named ""Fairy Cakes""!",USA
New York,eat,P. Moran's,"From crêpes and pastries to bangers and mash: at the end of 2015, restaurateur and Buffalo booster extraordinaire Prish Moran shuttered the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''' and replaced it a few months later with what is easily Buffalo's most authentic British pub. The beauty of this place lies in its simplicity and lack of pretense: the menu is on the small side and doesn't try for anything hoity-toity, it's just good solid UK comfort food. P. Moran's serves two kinds of meat pies — chicken and Guinness beef — and while the pies themselves are not quite up to the rarefied standard set by '''Parker's''' in South Buffalo, the ambience here is far better than a prefab warehouse in an industrial neighborhood: the dimly-lit, wood-panelled interior is picture-perfect, and the cozy bar features a good selection of beer (sadly, local craft brews dominate over imported British ales, and there aren't any taps here: bottles only) as well as wine and cider. Elsewhere on the menu you'll find a hearty ploughman's platter big enough to serve at least two, a vegetarian quiche that's a holdover from the old Sweetness 7 menu, cheese and sausage plates, and — for dessert — a delicious, dense figgy pudding ''à la mode'' with caramel sauce. Prices at P. Moran's are quite inexpensive except when it comes to beer and wine, which is another story entirely.",USA
New York,eat,Parkside Meadow,"In the words of ''Buffalo Rising'', ""dinner with a side of nostalgia"" is the order of the day at the Parkside Meadow. Let's talk nostalgia first: this place opened in September 2015 on the site of the similarly named '''Park Meadow''' bar, but those who may be familiar with that longtime neighborhood stalwart can be reassured that they're in for a much more relaxed experience than the rowdy frat-boy hijinks they may remember. Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie had their work cut out for them when they bought the place — it had been vacant since 1991 and had seen better days — but not only did they painstakingly restore the building to its former glory, but they filled the interior with such a vast collection of old-Buffalo postcards, photographs, and artifacts that it may as well be considered a satellite location of the '''Buffalo History Museum'''. As for the food, head chef Stephen Dulanski, fresh off the success of his run at new downtown hotspot '''Toutant''', has created a menu that is informed but not confined by the classic Buffalo pub grub that defines those bygone days, yet has improved on that template with food impeccably crafted using high-quality ingredients. Sandwiches rule the roost at Parkside Meadow: the reuben features tender, rosy corned beef piled high on thick-sliced, griddled-to-perfection rye, with Russian dressing and sauerkraut that add balanced notes without overpowering the flavor of the meat; meanwhile, in the pulled pork sandwich the spicy and peppery barbecue sauce that the meat is cooked in is tempered with cool, crunchy coleslaw. There are some creative touches too: the shaved lamb sandwich comes on toasted sourdough with melted Havarti cheese and spearmint aioli, for example, and the roasted leek and shiitake farfalle with Madeira cream sauce shows that Parkside Meadow can do more than just sandwiches. Service is excellent even when they're busy (which is pretty much all the time), and the downhome neighborhood friendliness of the staff is yet another reminder of olden times.",USA
New York,eat,Main Amherst Fillmore Market,"Launched for the 2016 season with funding from the Participatory Budgeting Buffalo program, the Main Amherst Fillmore Market sets up shop every Saturday morning and afternoon in the Vernon Triangle, in the parking lot next to '''International Wine & Spirits''', with a mandate of providing an outlet for fresh, healthy, locally-sourced foods in a part of town where the only food shops within walking distance are corner bodegas.

By day, the ""Foundry Lounge"" downstairs features coffee in a relaxing ambience; by night you can enjoy a rousing game of pool while bartenders whip you up an upscale mixed drink. The Foundry Suites also provides guests with free parking, free concierge service, free passes to '''LA Fitness''', and a 24-hour business center. Also, the location, while it may seem out-of-the-way at first glance, is quite convenient: the boutiques and restaurants of the Elmwood Village and Hertel Avenue, the greenery of Delaware Park, and the cultural attractions of the Museum District are all within easy striking distance.",USA

Darwin D. Martin, whose Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house is located kitty-corner from here, was a parishioner in the early days. With the Reverend Catherine Dempesy-Sims at the helm, the Church of the Good Shepherd, like many of Buffalo's Protestant congregations, is a progressive, diverse and accepting faith community (describing itself as ""a place of welcome to all, no exceptions"") which is active in a wide range of charitable and neighborhood-improvement organizations and initiatives.",USA
New York,other,North Park Lutheran Church,North Park Lutheran Church has traditionally been a congregation whose outsize sense of community — both within the congregation and as a component of the larger community — belies its small size.

Emperor Nicholas I conceived as a present to his daughter Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia on the occasion of her marriage. - Although the reddish-brown facade is elaborately rusticated and features Corinthian columns arranged in a traditional Neoclassical mode, the whole design was inspired by the 17th-century French Baroque messuages.

Saint Petersburg,see,Stroganov Palace,"Now the palace is a branch of the Russian Museum. - The palace was built to Bartolomeo Rastrelli's designs for Baron Sergei Grigoriyevich Stroganov in 1753-1754. The interiors were remodeled by Andrei Voronikhin at the turn of the 19th century. - The main façade of the Stroganov palace faces Nevsky Prospect. Here, Rastrelli rejects the cour d'honneur in the French manner. By this time, Rastrelli has developed his own style based on exploring the impressive façade, which implies the presence of three risolites, the subordination to a single center, rejection of verticalization, and stretching the building horizontally. Rastrelli gives the building a single mass movement toward the center. He skillfully emphasizes this by subordinating the lateral risolites to the central, imposing group of columns of purely decorative, not architectonic, function, deliberately building up tension toward the center of the sculpted front. Rastrelli uses the giant order, the method of visual fusion of the second and third floor windows, typical for the Baroque, and the differentiated arrangement of columns closely adjacent to the wall in order to create a masterful effect and an impressive Baroque façade facing St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. The facade carries an entrance arch supported by two Corinthian columns. The arch is crowned with a pediment bearing the Stroganov coat of arms. The spaces under the windows on the facade feature a man's profile. There are two practically anecdotal versions regarding this man's identity. According to one version, the man is the first owner of the palace, Baron Stroganov, whom Rastrelli wanted to surprise. However, many historians claim that the famous architect in fact left his own profile on the palace walls.",Russia

Saint Petersburg,see,Catholic Church of St. Catherine,"This is the oldest Catholic church in Russia, and the only church in Russia with the title of minor basilica. - On October 7, 1783, the church was completed. Because the Empress at the time was Catherine II of Russia (also known as Catherine the Great), the church was named after St. Catherine of Alexandria. Under the Soviets, the activities of the church were repressed. For 30 years, the building was used only as storage space for the nearby ""Museum of History of Religion and of Atheism"" located in former Our Lady of Kazan Church. Since 1980's the government used the building as offices and apartments. In 1992, city authorities decided to return the building to the Catholic Church. The restoration of the church was completed in 2008. - The building is in the shape of a Latin cross. The transept of the church is crowned by a large cupola. The temple is 44m in length, 25m in width, and 42m in height. The sanctuary has room for about 2,000 people.

Sprawling for over one kilometer and embracing the area of 53,000m2, the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building works commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional Neoclassical design submitted by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe (1729–1800). - The next century, Gostiny Dvor was continuously augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. By that time, the Gostiny Dvor had lost its popularity to the more fashionable Passage and New Passage, situated on the Nevsky Prospekt nearby. During the post-World War II reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being.

The Saint Petersburg building code did not allow structures taller than the Winter Palace, residence of the emperor. The architect found an elegant solution to the limit of 23.5m : the six-storey Art Nouveau building is crowned with a glass tower, which in turn is topped by a glass globe sculpture created by the Estonian artist Amandus Adamson. This tower creates the impression of a substantial elevation, but is subtle enough not to overshadow either the Kazan Cathedral or the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. - In 1919, the building was given to the Petrograd State Publishing House. It became the city's largest book store, and was subsequently named ""The House of Books"" in 1938. The book store remained functioning during the Siege of Leningrad until November 1942.

Saint Petersburg,see,The Passage,"This is an elite department store, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998. Parenthetically, the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre.The name came from a vast gallery between Nevsky Avenue and Italianskaya Street which provided the main passage through the mall. The gallery was covered over by an arching glass and steel roof, thus giving it a claim to being one of the world's first shopping malls. The three-storey building opened on May 9, 1848. It was one of the first structures in Russia to employ gas for lighting. Another innovation was an underground floor, where an electric station would be installed in 1900. Although the store specialized in jewellery, expensive clothes and other luxury goods, crowds of common people flocked to see the most fashionable shop of the Russian Empire. Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor,- the developer,- conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo. - To draw even more consumers to the store, the Soleille, one of the largest cinemas in the Russian capital, was opened in the complex in 1908. - In 1933, the municipal authorities declared the Passage a ""model department store"", the only one in Leningrad (former St Petersburg) and one of only three such stores in the Soviet Union. The renovated ""palace of Soviet trade"" (as the media touted it) opened in 1934 and offered about 30,000 types of goods, all manufactured in the USSR.

In 1906-08 the bridge had to be reconstructed and its arches reinforced. - '''The Horse Tamers''' rank among the city's most recognizable landmarks.

A prominent St. Petersburg merchant I. Lazarev, gave one of numerous houses for Theatre. In 1842–1896 an Italian architect L. Vendramini the house was rebuilt. - In 1896 Grand duke Nikolay Nikolaevich, grandson of Nikolay I, had bought the house and afterwards presented it to his favourite - well-known actress of Alexandrinsky Theatre M. Pototzkaya. In all probability in this period at will of Grand duke interiors of first floor were anew trimmed, and became splendid palace apartments. In 1910 year building was passed to treasury, and then was bought by private entrepreneur I. Piltzov, the inner apartments of the building were reconstructed for presenting theatre productions. - Interiors of theatre, cozy and elegant, bear marks of very different architecture styles, that is why they are eclectic in astonishing way. Well-known in whole city three-flights stairs, reception-rooms, lobbies with quaint patterns of modelling, dissemination of painting and bronze are evidence of refinement of rococo style. In decoration of lobby placed over entrance to the theatre could be seen influence of style of Italian Renaissance. One lobby was specially rebuilt as a grotto, which was stylish tendency in the beginning of 20th century. Walls of this hall were faced with raw masonry, in which cracks were hidden electric light bulbs; and in small ponds placed in the corners of grotto water flowed. Sometimes in theatre came people who were not interested in theatre at all, they were just curious – they wanted to see the luxurious stairs and to visit grotto. - In architecture of the hall – one of the most early and few in number Petersburg interiors of public purpose of the 1900's – it’s possible to see the influence of Russian late classicism, «streamlined neoclassicism». Hall differs from vivid theatre foyers by accented monumentality, plane angles of walls and discretion of architectural details; and elements of architecture borrowed from late classicism went well together with forms corresponding with engineer possibilities of that time. -",Russia

Due to strict dress code don't try to enter with a backpack and be ready to  hear that the party tonight is ""invitation only"". It means the security did not like your look. The place was opened by St. Petersburg avant-garde musician and heartthrob Kirill Ivanov and friends in the beginning of 2011, at the end of 2011 Mishka has already achieved the title of'' St. Petersburg's Best Bar'' according to TimeOut magazine. During daytime, Mishka more of a cafe (with free WiFi), where you can relax, read and/or chat and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and fresh salads. In fact, it's one of the few places that serves in line with the Western understanding of ""salad"" - a huge bowl of fresh greens with a choice of other fresh ingredients to add, rather than the traditional Russian understanding of salad which is usually a lot of mayonnaise with other ingredients and often without any greens at all. There are two spaces - the entrance space is the ""club"" side, generally the rowdier side and the place to get boozed up and drunkenly dance the night away, and the second space is more relaxed, more brightly lit, non-smoking, and a comfortable place to grab a bite to eat (even at 4am!) and sit and chat with your friends without shouting over the music from the entrance space.  At night there is usually a DJ playing (even on weeknights!) whatever hipsters are listening to these days (rather than typical Russian clubs that only play worn-out house and 90s pop) and the bar can get very crowded on weekend nights.  Try one of the dozens of specialty shots to get your night started in the right spirit... or to end your night, if you're on a bender.",Russia

Produkty features a carefully thought-out range of alcohol - all the makings of any classic cocktail as well as a delicious and dry cider ""St. Anton"", grog, milkshakes with berries, a homemade hot ginger tea, as well as freshly squeezed orange juice. The food is mainly vegetarian, and the offerings include couscous and sandwiches. All the furniture was brought from Berlin: the leatherette-upholstered bar, massive leather armchairs, round bar stools from the 1970s, chairs taken from GDR kindergartens and schools, typewriters and a Wurlitzer jukebox that only accepts Deutschmark (don't worry! you can buy the necessary Deutschmark tokens at the bar).

The gold items are sold by weight with a ""making charge"" added on top to cover the workmanship.

Both the Spice Souk and the Gold Souq are a rather hot and sweaty experience with limited air-conditioning, so wear appropriately cool, loose clothing if visiting in mid summer.

Though Artfarms' temporary works might pop up pretty much anywhere on the East Side, their two main installations can be found at the '''Michigan Riley Farm''' in Cold Spring and the '''Wilson Street Urban Farm''' in Broadway-Fillmore (see the ""Buy"" section for more on those). Respectively, these are the site of '''''Tree''''', a functional sculpture by Michael Beitz that consists of a picnic table designed in a curvilinear, branching form suggestive of a tree, and '''''Fall and Rise''''', a delicate-looking, roughly dome-shaped sculpture of curving metal rods and wire mesh that serves as a hothouse for the farm's more delicate plants, with the walls also used as lattices for climbing vines.",USA

At the Gallery @ the Guild, the focus is on so-called ""restoration art"": found objects from some of the same soon-to-be-demolished buildings where the warehouse store downstairs sources its merchandise are repurposed and reimagined in magnificent ways, displaying the timeworn beauty of the old craftsmanship.",USA
New York,see,Locust Street Art,"By most people's definition, what's housed in this repurposed Civil War-era convent on a residential street in the Fruit Belt is not an art gallery. Rather, Locust Street Art is best-known for offering free, professionally-taught art and photography lessons for children and adults; it's been doing so since 1959, when local art teacher Molly Bethel began giving informal painting lessons to neighborhood children in her living room. Locust Street Art has fostered the formative talents of many successful artists over the years, and has been recognized as a winner of the New York Governor's Award in 1985, as well as by the Harvard Graduate School of Education for excellence as an educational resource for economically disadvantaged communities. The best way to see the fruits of this effort are during the art shows and fundraisers Locust Street Art holds on an occasional basis, featuring the work of current students as well as other area artists.",USA

Intended as a mixed-use facility for offices and light industrial concerns, the building instead became an epicenter for the nascent East Side arts community, with studios, galleries, and cultural institutions snapping up a disproportionate share of the space. The prominent presence of the arts here is celebrated with '''Trimania''', a huge biannual festival featuring live music, performances and art shows on all five floors of the building, as well as '''Fourth Fridays''', a smaller monthly open house where studios and galleries display artists' works.

As one might expect, the exhibits at the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum run heavily towards antique cars and automotive memorabilia, especially Pierce-Arrows, the luxury sedans produced in Buffalo in the early 20th century to which the museum owes its name. The museum's ''pièce de résistance'' debuted in June 2014: Buffalo's seventh and newest Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building, a filling station constructed according to an original 1927 blueprint which Wright intended for the corner of Michigan Avenue and Cherry Street a short distance north of here.",USA

New York,see,Iron Island Museum,"With a history linked closely to the railroad industry that was so prominent in Buffalo at the turn of the century, the neighborhood of Lovejoy is nicknamed ""Iron Island"" because it is surrounded by railroad tracks on all four sides. The Iron Island Museum was opened in 2000 by the '''Iron Island Preservation Society''' and is dedicated to retelling the history of Lovejoy with a particular emphasis on the railroads that have shaped its identity. Formerly a funeral home, the Iron Island Museum's reputation for ghost sightings has attracted the attention of paranormal researchers from around the region and further afield, as well as the television shows ""Ghost Lab"" and ""Ghost Hunters"". Accordingly, overnight ghost hunts, conducted periodically by reservation, are a popular offering of the Iron Island Museum.",USA
New York,see,Nash House Museum,"The Nash House Museum is located just east of downtown: one block from Michigan Avenue, the birthplace of Buffalo's African-American community in the mid-19th Century. This Nationally Registered Historic Place was once the home of Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until his retirement in 1953 — was a personal friend of such nationally-known luminaries of black history as Booker T. Washington and Adam Clayton Powell, and was instrumental in the founding of the local chapter of the NAACP and in advocacy on behalf of Buffalo's African-American citizenry in the years before the Civil Rights Movement. Today, his house is open as a museum that contains engaging exhibits and archival records chronicling the history of Buffalo's African-American community. Also, the house itself is architecturally significant as a particularly good example of the wood-frame, partially prefabricated ""Buffalo doubles"" that were built here by the thousands around the turn of the century.",USA
New York,see,"Martin Luther King, Jr. Park","The crown jewel of the East Side's parks is its representative in the roster of Buffalo's Olmsted network: the site of the '''Buffalo Museum of Science''', the '''Humboldt Basin''', a handsome rose garden, walking paths, playgrounds, picnic shelters, and pleasant greenery. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was the first of Buffalo's Olmsted parks to open to the public, in 1872: called ""The Parade"" at first, it was designed to host military drills and other large gatherings, with the brightly colored '''Parade House''' as its centerpiece and '''Humboldt Parkway''', the most magnificent of all the Olmsted parkways in Buffalo, linking it to the rest of the system. But the Parade was far from any military installations Buffalo had; to the consternation of Olmsted, the park instead became a gathering place for the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed his quiet pastoral vision for it with raucous oompah bands that played at the Parade House and neighborhood scamps damaging the grass with their roughhousing. To the rescue came Olmsted's two sons, the successors in his firm; their 1896 redesign curved Fillmore Avenue to discourage through traffic and added the Humboldt Basin, a lovely '''Lily Pond''', and formal gardens. The Olmsted brothers renamed the park Humboldt Park, a name that was changed yet again in 1977 to its current one. Sadly, like most of the other elements of Buffalo's park system, the integrity of the Olmsteds' original design of the park sustained considerable damage over the course of the 20th Century: the Parade House is long-gone, part of its west edge was sacrificed in 1929 for the science museum, and there's a basketball court where the Lily Pond used to be. But the greatest indignity happened in 1960, when Humboldt Parkway was torn asunder to make way for the '''Kensington Expressway''' ''(see infobox at right)''. The '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy''' is hard at work righting those wrongs: the Humboldt Basin has already been renovated and reopened, the restoration of the '''Shelter House''' is ongoing, and plans are afoot to recreate the Lily Pond.",USA
New York,see,Humboldt Basin,"The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin is a five-acre (2 ha) water feature of several functions: in the summer it serves as a ""splash pad"" where neighborhood kids can cool off and frolic underneath fountains of cool water that jet upwards from sprinklers embedded in the ground, in the winter it's an outdoor ice rink, and in the spring and fall it's a pleasant, peaceful reflecting pool. The Humboldt Basin was reconstructed and reopened in 2013 by the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy'''; originally, it was part of the Olmsted brothers' 1896 redesign of what was then called Humboldt Park, an immense wading pool with a sand and clay bottom (later replaced with concrete) that had been dry and abandoned since the 1980s.",USA
New York,see,Martin Luther King Tribute Plaza,"Designed by sculptor John Wilson, the Martin Luther King Tribute Plaza was unveiled in October 1983, six years after the city made good on its longstanding promise to neighborhood residents to rename the erstwhile Humboldt Park in honor of the civil rights leader that's depicted in this eight-foot (2.5m) bronze bust portrait. The figure is sculpted in a somewhat idealized way; in the words of the artist, it was intended to ""sum up the larger-than-life ideas"" of Dr. King and capture his ""inner meaning"" rather than simply as a lifelike representation. Underneath the bust, on the side of the low stone wall that serves as its pedestal, is a bas-relief engraving of Dr. King at the podium at his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.",USA
New York,see,Rose Garden,"Hidden in plain sight on a quiet pedestrian walkway right next to the science museum is Martin Luther King, Jr. Park's rose garden: a small, cozy, tree-shaded oasis recently restored by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy where a variety of roses and other flowering plants bloom in season.",USA

Today, Buffalo hosts the largest organized Dyngus Day celebration in the world — including Poland, where the festival has largely been forgotten. Since the mid-2000s, Buffalo's annual Dyngus Day celebration has once again been held in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore at the grand old '''New York Central Terminal''', a majestic old Art Deco train station that is yet another of Buffalo's architectural masterpieces that is undergoing extensive restoration. After the Dyngus Day Parade through the streets of Broadway-Fillmore opens the festivities, traditional Polish food and (even more popularly) drink are served in the old dining room, with polka bands attracting revelers to the dance floor. Celebrations are also held at '''St. Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr Church''' (the so-called ""Mother Church of Polonia""), the '''Adam Mickiewicz Library''', and the many Polish-owned bars and taverns that continue to soldier on in the old neighborhood.",USA

Not only do artists and other businesses open their studios and display their latest masterwork to the public, but all six floors of this old WWI-era factory building are transformed for an evening into a giant freeform performance space, where live bands, DJs, comedians, dancers, poets, and performance artists vie for your attention in a lively multimedia art party that doesn't wind down until well after midnight. Drinks flow freely, the hungry can choose from a multitude of food trucks and other vendors, and all proceeds go to benefit the '''Buffalo Arts Studio'''.",USA

Today, each June 19th sees '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' host the nation's third-largest Juneteenth festival. Beginning with a parade that proceeds westward down Genesee Street from Moselle Street to the park, Buffalo's Juneteenth festival is a lively two-day celebration that includes demonstrations of traditional African and African-American art, music and dance, ethnic foods, crafts and wares, and activities for children.",USA

As well, a sprinkling of nationally-famous jazz performers stop by occasionally, plus other types of music (for instance, on the bill of the 2014 festival was Alassane Sarr, an African dancer and fourth-generation ''griot'' originally from Senegal). There are eight performances in all: four on each festival day.",USA
New York,do,Queen City Jazz Festival,"The newest in a growing list of festivals celebrating Buffalo's long-neglected jazz history, the late-July Queen City Jazz Festival sees a slate of mainly local jazz artists take the stage for an evening at the historic '''Colored Musicians Club''' on Broadway. There are two stages — the main one indoors as well as a refreshing outdoor performance space — that host about fifteen acts combined, and the adjacent '''Colored Musicians Club Museum''' opens during the festival with reduced admission rates.",USA
New York,do,Pine Grill Reunion,"Though the '''Pine Grill''' closed some thirty years ago, the memories of the halcyon days of that Jefferson Avenue nightspot — when jazz greats like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and Dizzy Gillespie played to packed houses — are sweet enough to have inspired the '''African-American Cultural Center''' to launch an annual jazz festival that bears its name. Much like the '''Masten District Jazz Festival''', concerts take place at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' on consecutive Sunday evenings: in this case, the first two in August, beginning at 4PM sharp. The first week features nationally-famous acts, while the second week is all about the local jazz scene that's still going strong in Buffalo — and best of all, performances often feature the same old Hammond B3 organ that was once the centerpiece of the Pine Grill. Also, unlike the Masten District festival, food vendors are on hand (though you're welcome to BYO as well).",USA
New York,do,Dożynki Polish Harvest Festival,"''Dożynki'' is a traditional harvest festival of rural Poland that goes back centuries, and since 1980, it's been celebrated in Buffalo over three days in mid-August at '''Corpus Christi Church''' on Clark Street. Dożynki is has grown into one of the largest annual festivals in Polonia; appropriately enough for its harvest theme, Polish cuisine is the star of the show: chefs vie annually for the coveted prize of ""Buffalo's Best Pierogi"", and a special ""Polish pizza"" is trotted out just for the occasion. As well, there's live polka music, folk dancers, guided tours of the church, raffles, and the ever-popular crowning of ""Miss Dożynki"", as well as a special Harvest Mass that kicks off the final day of the festivities.",USA
New York,do,Canisius Golden Griffins,"Canisius College is home to seventeen athletic teams whose games are huge draws for Buffalonians. The ""Griffs"" play Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference basketball at the {{marker|type=do|name=Koessler Athletic Center|lat=42.920964|long=-78.857466}} on Main Street at East Delavan Avenue, while outdoor sports like soccer and lacrosse are held at the {{marker|type=do|name=Demske Athletic Complex|lat=42.921329|long=-78.855885}} a short distance away.

New York,do,FC Buffalo,"Founded in 2009, FC Buffalo is a member of the National Premier Soccer League. After spending the previous two years at '''Canisius College''''s '''Demske Athletic Complex''', as of the 2015 season the team has moved back to its original home at {{marker|type=do|name=All-High Stadium|lat=42.943069|long=-78.831007}} in Fillmore-Leroy.

Tickets are reasonably priced.",USA

The 130-seat theater is located inside the cultural center's headquarters on Masten Avenue in Buffalo's East Side, and features a handful of productions each year with an especial focus on the African-American experience. Among the famous personalities that have performed on the Paul Robeson Theatre's stage include Ossie Davis, Phylicia Rashad, and Woodie King, Jr.",USA
New York,do,Torn Space Theater,"Aside from being Western New York's premiere Polish-American social club as well as home to both Buffalo's oldest Polish library and one of its largest '''Dyngus Day''' celebrations, the historic {{marker|type=do|name=Adam Mickiewicz Library and Dramatic Circle|lat=42.890083|long=-78.839391}} is also where this avant-garde black box theater has been operated since 2000 by local impresarios Dan Shanahan and Melissa Meola. Torn Space Theater's production team draws on multiple different artistic media and disciplines, such as music and visual art, to present lively, imaginative, and truly original dramatic works by auteurs from around the local region, as well as innovative reimaginations of well-known existing works like Eugene O'Neill's ''The Hairy Ape''. In addition to the performances at the Mickiewicz Library, Torn Space is unique among the Buffalo theatre community in producing site-specific works designed specifically to be performed in iconic Buffalo settings such as '''Canalside''' and '''Silo City'''. And, around Halloween, their annual '''Prom of the Dead''' art and music bash packs the house at the '''Dnipro Center''' on Genesee Street.",USA
New York,do,Central Park Grill,"Most of the time, ""CPG's"" is a cozy, sedate Main Street bar & grill situated about midway between '''Canisius College''' and University Heights, serving well-prepared comfort food and cocktails to the over-25 crowd. What it's best known for, though, are the sizzling blues shows that happen every Friday and Saturday night, where local combos like Dive House Union, the Jony James Band, and the Heavenly Chillbillies strut their stuff at the center of the Buffalo blues universe. Other genres like soul, funk, jazz and reggae crop up from time to time too, and if there's no band onstage when you visit you can still get your fix with the Internet jukebox and its encyclopedic selection of blues numbers.",USA
New York,do,Colored Musicians' Club,"Located on Broadway just outside downtown, this former home of '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''' (and, before that, the '''Charlie Zifle Shoe Store''') has done double-duty as a renowned jazz club since not much later than the union chapter's foundation in 1918, made necessary when '''Local 43''' voted to bar local African-American musicians from membership. With jazz music all the rage among the black community at the time, the union's second-floor performance space became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of local ragtime and jazz bands after their workday was finished, or on Sundays, to see them rehearse in the practice space the union provided free to its members. Soon enough, it was a venue in its own right, playing host to world-famous luminaries like Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton, and more. The tradition continues today: the Colored Musicians' Club hosts big-band concerts on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons followed by a legendary open jam session in the evening. And if you're interested in the club's storied history, there's also an attached museum ''(q.v.)'' where you can learn all you've ever wanted to know about Buffalo's jazz scene of yesterday and today.",USA
New York,do,The Foundry,"The Foundry is a former industrial workshop in Masten Park that now serves as an incubator for a wide range of grassroots small businesses, as well as a venue for various community-centered events and happenings. One of those events is '''Roc da Mic''', a monthly showcase for Buffalo's underground hip-hop community. On the last Thursday of each month, local MCs, DJs, breakdancers, poets, and other artists converge to strut their stuff in a freeform open-mic extravaganza.",USA
New York,buy,Bailey Jewelry,"Yes, ""CASH FOR GOLD"" is proclaimed loudly and proudly on the signs that adorn the front of this humble storefront, but Bailey Jewelry is more than just another sleazy old-gold broker. On the contrary, the selection of 10-karat, 14-karat and silver jewelry here is impressive indeed. As is the rule on the East Side, the merchandise here runs heavily toward urban and hip-hop styles: big, chunky hoop earrings, pendants, and diamond rings and watches abound on the shelves here. If you don't like what you see, Bailey Jewelry's owner will even custom-design a piece just for you. Prices are fair for what you get, but what you get is of surprisingly high quality, so come prepared to spend a little bit. If jewelry repair is what you're after, they do that too — again at fair prices.",USA
New York,buy,Beauty Plus,"In business on Bailey Avenue since 2009, the main stock in trade at Beauty Plus is a range of wholesale beauty salon equipment and supplies, as well as a great selection of wigs, in many cases made of real human hair. However, there's a wide range of street-style jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing on the walls and shelves of this crowded shop at the heart of the Kensington-Bailey business district. Beauty Plus is also an authorized dealer of Dickies workwear.",USA
New York,buy,Carrie's High Fashions,"Carrie's High Fashions is a small place that's not particularly easy to find: look for the small ""Hats & Shoes"" sign in the window next to '''Jackson Hewitt Tax Service''', on the east side of Bailey Avenue. Hats and shoes are indeed the cornerstones of the merchandise at Carrie's, the selection of which comprises resale vintage items as well as vintage-inspired new pieces. There's elegant, high-fashion ladies' hats perfect for church on Sunday, and beautiful dresses in bold yet refined colors and styles.",USA
New York,buy,City Fashion,"Since 2005, City Fashion's stylish, elegant ladieswear has been attracting folks from all over the city and beyond — folks come from as far as Toronto to browse the great selection of quality items on the racks. if you're planning a special occasion such as a graduation, prom or wedding, you're in luck. The service here is friendly and helpful, and they do tailoring and alterations as well.",USA
New York,buy,Fashion City,"A huge store with a huge selection, Fashion City's inventory goes above and beyond the streetwise urban styles you see in other Bailey Avenue clothes shops: you'll find plenty of that, but also a healthy admixture of clothes in a more traditional, even preppy, aesthetic. The interior of the store is decorated in a brash and vibrant scheme, highlighted by a loud black-and-white checkered tile floor, and it's where you'll find a wide range of name-brand clothes for men and women on racks, shelves, even hanging from the rafters. You'll find sweats, hoodies, jeans, t-shirts, baseball caps, flannels, bubble jackets, shoes and boots (there's a huge wall given over to Timberlands), and much more. Fashion City is also an authorized dealer of Dickies work apparel.",USA
New York,buy,KoKo's Fashions,"Ladies' fashions are the main attraction at this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip, and value for your money is what sets it apart from the competition. Koko's is a clothing store designed for the professional, no-nonsense urban lady on the go: eschewing the loud, brash, somewhat tacky streetwise styles you'll find elsewhere, the clothes here are sophisticated, understated, and upscale while retaining just the right degree of sass. And the prices can't be beat. At Koko's plus sizes abound, there's a great selection of shoes — and if you're a Buffalo Bills fan in town during football season, you're in luck, as this is when they clear out space on the slaes floor for a ''huge'' variety of Bills jerseys, hoodies, jackets, men's and women's shirts, and (for the most diehard fans) vintage-style Zubaz pants.",USA
New York,buy,Lucky's Fashions,"Lucky's may not look like much from the outside, but there's a huge selection of different stuff inside that goes above and beyond ""The Latest Fashion and Beauty"" that the sign outside touts. The front of the store is given over to a decent selection of polo shirts, men's and women's T-shirts, jeans, and workwear, while in back you have bath products, body oils, wigs, hair extensions, and other such items. Finally, this jack-of-all-trades shop even sells, unlocks and repairs cell phones — a variety of brands and plans are offered. No matter what brings you here, though, you can be assured of friendly and helpful service. Lucky's also has a second location on Sycamore Street in Broadway-Fillmore that deals in cell phones only.",USA
New York,buy,One of a Kind Fashion,"""Don't be predictable"", exhorts the motto emblazoned on the front of this humble storefront, and true to its word, One of a Kind Fashions offers up an inventory that's different from your average Bailey Avenue urban clothing boutique: the selection here is decidedly upscale, without sacrificing any of the streetwise style of its neighbors. The retail space here is split into two levels: in front there is streetwear and accessories like watches, belts, jewelry, handbags and shoes whose aesthetic tends toward the loud and outlandish; walk up a few steps in back to find a range of more conservative dresses, skirts, and tops perfect for a night on the town. Furthering the balancing act between elegance and sass is the interior, brightly lit and decorated with stylish minimalism yet with delightfully gaudy accents here and there like mirrored walls.",USA
New York,buy,Swag,"There's lots of urban clothes crammed into this ample, warmly decorated strip-mall boutique, particularly menswear: t-shirts, jeans, hoodies and more. Belts, shoes, boots and other accessories come in bold, bright colors and really make a statement. The folks at Swag also fix broken mobile phones, iPads and iPods.",USA
New York,buy,United Men's Fashion,"Established in 1929 by brothers Morris and Herman Cohen and still run by the same family, United Men's Fashions is by far the oldest operating business in the neighborhood. Over the years it's expanded its footprint into all three of the adjacent houses at the corner of Midway Avenue, cementing its place at the center of the Ken-Bailey retail universe. ""The clothes make the man"" is a maxim that's oft-repeated here, and United Men's Fashions lives those words out with their extensive selection of menswear: a high-quality array of suit jackets, dress shirts and pants, tuxedos and other formalwear, sweaters, hats, and men's accessories such as ties, cufflinks, lapel pins, and belts occupy the shelves here. Despite sporting a style that's sometimes flashy, with bright, offbeat colors to choose from, what's sold here is classy and sophisticated: these pieces would be much more at home in a high-end men's shop in New York or Los Angeles than on the East Side, as attested to by the thriving online mail-order business these folks do to homes all over the United States. Prices are not half bad, either, and the icing on the cake is superlatively friendly, attentive and helpful customer service of the kind that makes it easy to understand how the business has lasted this long.",USA
New York,buy,Young Fashion,"Since 1992, owner Kim Young has operated this urban fashion boutique, stocking street gear and accessories for both men and women at the heart of the Bailey strip. The styles you'll find at Young Fashions are pretty much in line with the standard set by its neighboring competitors, but the selection is decent, and they're also an authorized seller of Dickies brand workwear.",USA
New York,buy,An Chau Asian Market,"If you've been to its big sister on Niagara Street, you'll know what to expect from the East Side satellite location of An Chau: crowded aisles stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Compared to its West Side counterpart, this place is smaller but also cleaner and less chaotic and claustrophobic, with shelves crowded with all manner of sauces, oils, pickles, snacks, and packaged groceries. The far-side aisles are lined with coolers and freezers that contain frozen meats and fresh exotic produce from tamarind to mung beans to Korean pears to white beech mushrooms, and there's a small counter in the back for fresh meat cut to order. One difference at the Bailey Avenue location is there's also a small range of Caribbean foodstuffs there, including johnnycake mix. If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, An Chau has you covered — and if you just got done tucking into a bowl of ''pho'' down the street at '''Pho 99''' and have the itch to try making some at home, they have frozen meatballs and even packaged instant soup mix. A word of warning, though: check the sell-by dates, as An Chau is known to occasionally keep expired or near-expired items on the shelves.",USA
New York,buy,Bailey Furniture,"Owned and operated by Paul Diamond since 1980, Bailey Furniture is one of the longest-standing businesses in the area. The name of the game here is used and antique furniture, along with some new furniture. There's a wide selection to browse through at this crowded little shop, especially of dining room furniture, which seems to be a particular specialty. As the inventory is sourced mostly from used goods people sell to the shop, quality (and value for your money) varies widely from item to item, and the shopping experience is akin to a giant estate sale. Still, like any estate sale, there are bargains to be had at Bailey Furniture for those who are willing to hunt for them. It might be worthwhile to call ahead if you're thinking of stopping in: the staff has a habit of adhering rather loosely to their posted opening hours.",USA
New York,buy,New Style Records and Movies,"A 20-year veteran of the local music industry, Civic Davis has been selling the latest in R&B, hip-hop, reggae, gospel, jazz, and blues albums in this small shop since 1996. Browse through the selection of CDs and cassettes in the stylishly decorated sales floor overlooked by a huge fishbowl. DVDs of blockbuster Hollywood movies are available, as well as — interestingly — a range of spa and beauty care products.",USA
New York,buy,Big Basha Central,"Located just off the Jefferson Avenue exit of the '''Kensington Expressway''' at the edge of the Fruit Belt, Big Basha Central has been ""your one-stop shop"" since 1995 for clothing and gear in a wide variety of urban styles: T-shirts, hoodies and jeans from brands like Rocawear, Black Label, and Coogi, designer sneakers and Timberland boots, jackets, and ladieswear too. There's also a bodega-cum-beauty supply shop, '''Big Basha Market''', across the street.",USA
New York,buy,Park Avenue Coat Company,"Besides being a wholesale distributor of brand-name and designer leather coats, jackets, winter wear, caps, and t-shirts, Park Avenue Coat Company also has several retail locations, including one just outside downtown on the Near East Side. Here, in a no-frills warehouse environment, you can find some of the absolute cheapest outerwear in town: not only do you still pay wholesale prices for anything that's on the racks, but Park Avenue also sells ""slightly irregular"" merchandise direct from the manufacturers at an even steeper discount. If you want, say, a licensed Starter jacket of your favorite NFL, NBA, NHL, or NCAA sports team, but only have $15 to spend, this is the place for you. New merchandise arrives weekly, and prices tend to be especially good around February and March when they're clearing out their winter gear — but sadly, Park Avenue's massive retail floor is not very well staffed by salespeople, so you mostly have to fend for yourself to find what you're looking for.",USA
New York,buy,Utica Sneakertown,"A lot bigger inside than what it looks like from the parking lot, this Korean-owned footwear destination at the '''Jefferson-Utica Plaza''' in Cold Spring carries a decent selection of shoes — they're a licensed dealer of Timberland boots as well as Converse products. Oddly enough, Sneakertown also carries a modest array of urban-styled jewelry.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo Brewing Company,"Contrary to popular misconception, the Buffalo Brewing Company is ''not'' Buffalo's first nanobrewery (that title technically goes to '''Community Beer Works'''), but their pint-sized facility on the edge of the Ellicott District is certainly more in line with what most folks think of when they hear that term — Buffalo Brewing has a production capacity of two barrels per day, a pittance next to what CBW churns out on the West Side. Owner John Domres is a consummate beer aficionado — he started homebrewing almost as soon as he could legally drink — and by the time he purchased this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue and set about renovating it for its new purpose, this part of town had already staked its claim as epicenter of Buffalo's spanking-new artisanal brewing and distilling industry, with about a half-dozen like-minded neighbors in the nearby Old First Ward and Larkinville. The core of Buffalo Brewing's repertoire consists of four permanent beers, all produced 100% by hand and named for years significant to Buffalo's history (easily their most popular offering is ""1842"", a toasty Vienna lager made with imported hops whose name commemorates the invention of the grain elevator by Buffalo milling magnate Joseph Dart), along with a slate of seasonal brews named similarly. The hours they keep are brief, but if you're in town on a Friday or Saturday, they'll fill your growler for the unbelievable price of $15.",USA
New York,buy,Michigan Riley Farm,"Located on 12 vacant lots in Cold Spring that were sold at a municipal foreclosure auction in 2011, Michigan Riley is a bit different than most area urban farms. Rather than being owned and operated by one person or family, this place is run cooperatively: individual participants sign up each year for one of two levels of membership, with ""farmers"" ($150/year) entitled to a share of both the produce from the farm itself and profits from sales in exchange for a commitment of four hours of farm work per week throughout the season, and ""gardeners"" ($25/year), who are not held to any hard-and-fast commitments but can take a proportional share of the produce based on how much work they put in. For short-term visitors and those who aren't interested in volunteering, the best way to get your hands on some of Buffalo's freshest locally-grown seasonal vegetables and herbs is at the seasonally-open farm stand on Riley Street — as well as a few blocks away at '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street, on the second Saturday of each month.",USA
New York,buy,Swings Specialty Wings,"Buffalo's culinary history is a cautionary tale, littered with stories of folks who've tried and failed to reinvent the chicken wing. Kobie Lewis is different. Since 2002, this consummate wing lover has been on a quest to craft the perfect iteration of Buffalo's signature foodstuff, and along the way he's learned the important lesson of working within the limitations of his source material rather than trying to force chicken wings to fill roles they weren't designed for. The result is what he calls ""specialty wings"", or ""swings"" for short — and Lewis has five '''National Wing Fest''' trophies to attest to his success. Every evening at this part-food shop, part-takeout restaurant, you can choose from over 18 original flavors, comprising the standard Buffalo sauce with varying levels of heat, barbecue wings from classic to hickory-smoked and honey BBQ, and oddballs like taco-seasoned and lemon-pepper wings. Swings sells their house-recipe wing sauce and barbecue sauce in bottles as well, in-store or via mail order.",USA
New York,buy,Choco-Logo Confectionery,"From his start in 1985 making custom promotional chocolate bars embossed with corporate logos (hence the name), ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson has guided Choco-Logo to its present-day status as perhaps the most highly-regarded chocolate manufacturer in Western New York (the accolades even extend to the pages of the ''New York Times'', who lauded them as the official chocolate provider for '''Bloomingdale's''' department stores). Located on Broadway just outside downtown and right next door to the historic '''Colored Musicians' Club''', Choco-Logo's small factory store has been open since 2005 to sate Buffalonians' sweet tooth with artisanal chocolates manufactured just a short walk away. Most of the time the selection here is fairly modest, comprising dark and milk chocolate truffles, chocolate-covered nuts, Choco-Logo's famous ""Nutcorn"" (caramel corn stuffed with roasted nuts and coated in chocolate), and a variety of sea-salted caramels that were sampled by President Obama during his visit to Buffalo in 2010. But the holidays is when you really want to come — his seasonal selections are where Johnson's creativity really comes out to shine, with unique truffle options such as Eggnog, Black & Tan, and Ice Wine. Small-group tours of the attached chocolate factory are also available on request.",USA
New York,buy,The Peddler,"During winter, Newell Nussbaumer's upscale flea market — which spends the milder months at '''Parish Commons''' in the Elmwood Village — moves indoors to '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street. As always, the Peddler features a dizzying variety of antique knickknacks and upscale vintage clothes sold by a growing roster of vendors.",USA
New York,buy,Alive Christian Bookstore,"Operated since 1995 by the '''Greater Refuge Temple of Christ''''s Reverend Gordon Sweat and his wife Larcenia, Alive Christian Bookstore carries copies of the Bible in a variety of different translations, as well as Bible study materials, Sunday School readers from the Union Gospel Press, and sundry other Christian literature. The purview of this place doesn't end with books, though; Alive is also a source for church supplies including robes, clergy shirts and other specialty clothing.",USA
New York,buy,Bible Society of Western New York,"The Bible Society of Western New York has been active since 1847, a nondenominational and nonsectarian ministry that distributes to the local citizenry free copies of the Good Book written in a language that is plainspoken and accessible to the masses. That mission continues on today, but they also run a ""Bible Book Store"" on Main Street in Fillmore-Leroy that stocks a huge selection of different Bibles representing every edition you can think of as well as 40 foreign languages. Youth ministry guides, Bible study materials, and a small selection of other Christian and secular literature are also to be had, and the Bible Society has also teamed up with their next-door neighbor, '''Bender's Christian Store''', to offer church supplies such as Communion wafers, offering envelopes, and hundreds of different Christian homeschooling goods too. The ambience here is strictly no-frills — the better to keep their charitable, not-for-profit ''raison d'être'' going — but the staff is knowledgeable with any questions you may have, and the prices are unbeatable.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo ReUse,"Headquartered appropriately enough in an old industrial building on the north edge of Cold Spring, Buffalo ReUse's game is ""upcycling"" authentic discarded architectural elements, plumbing fixtures, furniture, and other interior pieces from homes that are slated for demolition or undergoing renovation — thereby keeping trash out of landfills while reducing demand for new items and the raw materials necessary to produce them. At the weekend ""sidewalk sales"" they hold in front of the building's Dupont Street entrance, you can buy these one-of-a-kind items — stuff you won't find in a million years at '''Home Depot''' or '''Lowe's''' — at a small fraction of what you'd pay for comparable reproduction pieces. Even if you're not looking to redo your home, the folks at ReUse are full of ideas for repurposing these old antiques into furniture, picture frames, decorative items, and more.",USA
New York,buy,Doris Records,"If you're a fan of modern R&B and hip-hop music or the sweet strains of classic soul and Motown, you'll want to make a stop at this institution that's been anchoring the north end of the Cold Spring business district since 1962. At Doris Records you'll get friendly service with no pretense or condescension, but to describe the place as ""old-school"" would be true in some ways and not in others. For instance, it's getting more and more rare to come across this type of small, friendly mom-and-pop record shop anymore — but the hipster-driven resurgence of vinyl LPs has yet to find its way here, with CDs and DVDs dominating the inventory and only a modest selection of record albums. You can also browse a modest variety of baseball caps, T-shirts, and other streetwear, as well as racks of urban-oriented lifestyle magazines such as ''XXL''.",USA
New York,buy,Bikeshop Buffalo,"The original Bikeshop has been at the service of East Aurora bicycle enthusiasts since 2006, and it's only fitting that the shop's first introduction to the rapidly growing community of urban cyclists in Buffalo has come via a storefront in '''The Hub''', the complex of bicycle culture-themed shops and loft apartments opened in 2014 in the old '''Sibley & Holmwood Candy Company''', of which Bikeshop is one of the original tenants. At Bikeshop Buffalo you can expect the same expert service and friendly mom-and-pop atmosphere as at the original, but here the product lines trend sharply toward high-performance road bikes for urban use, to the almost complete exclusion of off-road and mountain bikes. Bianchi, Redline, and Scott are some of the popular brands carried here, and available exclusively at the Buffalo location is the '''Retül''' line of professional performance-enhancing bike fittings. Also on offer are a full range of parts and accessories, helmets, jerseys, shoes, and even bike-mountable GPS units. Prices are high, but so is the quality of what this place carries, so if you're a serious cyclist Bikeshop Buffalo merits a look.",USA
New York,buy,Gear Up,"This brightly-decorated storefront in Delavan-Bailey is a destination for those in search of urban-oriented sportswear, outerwear, jeans and sneakers from popular brands like Nike, Timberland, and New Era. Gear Up is a crowded and not particularly well-organized place, but there are some nice finds if you're willing to hunt them down a little bit. That's especially true of the sneaker selection: if you're looking for something that really stands out, with bright colors and unusual designs, stop by. New arrivals come in every week, and Gear Up also boasts a modest range of ladies' fashions, handbags and other accessories.",USA
New York,buy,Get Your'z,"Owned since 2006 by James Barclay and situated on Genesee Street an easy walk from '''Schiller Park''', Get Your'z is a source for trendy, statement-making designer ladies' apparel (and some menswear too). Dresses, blouses, stylish jeans, leggings and hosiery come in bold colors and daring styles, and sales and promotions happen frequently. Interestingly, Get Your'z also stocks a range of car accessories.",USA
New York,buy,KeeKee's,"Owner Lakeisha Williams proudly sells her line of new and secondhand women's ""Fashions on a Budget"" in this sparsely decorated storefront in the heart of the Delavan-Bailey business district. If your tastes tend toward the Afrocentric, KeeKee's is the place for you, with lots of colorful wooden jewelry and flowing dresses in tribal-style prints, but aside from that the styles here tend to be a bit more understated than what you'll find on a your typical East Side urban fashion boutique. But there are some really upscale finds here among the dresses, blouses, shawls, shoes, handbags, and other accessories.",USA
New York,buy,Legacy Apparel & Footwear,"A newer addition to the roster of Bailey Avenue clothing boutiques, Legacy Apparel is a huge emporium located at the far southern end of the strip stocked with a huge range of streetwear for both men and women — hoodies, jackets, baseball caps, and some of the best-priced jeans you'll find anywhere on the East Side. Bright colors and hip-hop styles abound. And if Bailey Avenue is particularly busy on the day you visit, never fear about parking — Legacy Apparel boasts an ample off-street lot.",USA
New York,buy,Mr. Millennium II,"The East Side satellite location of the original '''Mr. Millennium''' in Grant-Amherst, Mr. Millennium II is located in Delavan-Bailey and mostly stocks the merchandise that has made the original so successful: a mixture of prepaid mobile phones and accessories on the one hand, and on the other hand a staggering range of clothing for men and women that runs the gamut from T-shirts and hoodies to designer jeans to ladies' formalwear to jewelry and accessories galore.",USA
New York,buy,Sky's the Limit,"Sky's the Limit is run by local entrepreneur Ahmed Ahmed, a second-generation Yemeni-American immigrant who also owns '''Farm Fresh Market''' across the street. The main attraction here is a dizzying range of beauty supplies as well as wigs and weaves, but there's also a similarly impressive selection of urban-style women's apparel and footwear, with excellent bargains to be had on bold, sassy tops, leggings, dresses and other formalwear, work uniforms, and even kids' clothing. The downside at Sky's the Limit is the customer service, which tends toward the inattentive.",USA
New York,buy,Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar,"As the name indicates, Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar is a small grocery store in Schiller Park that serves the needs of the area's teeming South Asian immigrant community with a small selection of ethnic foods. Here you'll find a variety of spices, staple foods such as rice and dried grains, as well as more standard bodega fare such as soda pop, snack foods, and canned goods. Friendly customer service is a specialty at Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar: the credo is ""Quality comes first, profit is its logical sequence"".",USA
New York,buy,Steve's Meats,"Steve's Meats has been serving the Delavan-Bailey community and beyond since 1978, and you don't get that kind of longevity in a business without something special in the mix — and the one factor that makes this place stand out from the rest of Buffalo's purveyors of fresh meat is the topnotch customer service. Again and again, customers rave about the consistent friendliness of owner Mark Lesinski and his staff and how they truly go above and beyond in assisting their customers, whether it be in-store helping them navigate the counters and freezers or making home deliveries to regular customers who can't make it out for whatever reason. As well, Steve's stocks some of the freshest meats around: stuffed pork chops, steak rollups, chuck roasts, chicken breasts, and even custom-made combo packs fly off the shelves, and in the freezers you'll find a selection of chicken fingers, pizza logs, and other snacks, Jamaican-style beef patties, and breakfast treats like waffles, French toast and hash browns. If you're visiting near the beginning of the month, you'll likely have to brave crowds, but customers nearly always leave happy.",USA
New York,buy,Dennise's More 4 Less,"""More"" is no exaggeration here — the merchandise offered by Georgetta Lowe at her brand-new Schiller Park shop can only be described as wide-ranging. Dennise's sells everything but the kitchen sink — kids' and adult clothes; shoes, handbags and accessories; housewares and decorative knickkacks; toys, quirky gifts, and even some furniture — with service that's friendly and outgoing. It can sometimes be a challenge navigating the crowded and jumbled interior of this place, but the prices are decent (and sometimes better than decent — sales and promotions are frequent, and special events take place periodically).",USA
New York,buy,M&J Wholesale,"This Delavan-Bailey destination stocks everything for the tobacco enthusiast on your list: M&J's has hookah pipes, loose tobacco, rolling papers, and other accessories for sale at rock-bottom prices (cash only, though).",USA
New York,buy,Broadway Market,"These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space boast dozens of stalls and eateries selling all manner of groceries, prepared foods, housewares, decorative baubles, and unique gifts all under one roof. Though its current building was erected in 1956, the Market dates to 1888, the very beginning of the area's rise as home of the city's Polish community; it was not only a place for neighborhood residents to stock up on daily essentials, but also a gathering place for Buffalo Poles to meet up with their friends, see and be seen, and enjoy a comforting reminder of their homeland. Today, Polish and other Eastern European foods and gifts still predominate, but the Market's offerings are slowly diversifying to better reflect the vibrant pastiche of the modern-day East Side, with soul food stands, halal groceries, and other eclectic goods on offer. The Market is most popular in the weeks leading up to Easter, when Buffalonians crowd through the doors in search of savory ''kielbasa'' and Polish hams, traditional pastries like ''chruściki'' and ''placek'', and the '''butter lambs''' that are a tradition peculiar to Buffalo. But it's worthwhile to visit during other times of the year too, when it's quiet enough to get a real feel for the place — outside the Easter season, Saturday is the best day to go, as many if not most of the stalls close on weekdays.",USA
New York,buy,"Dexter's Hats, Caps and Things","At the Broadway Market on Saturday mornings and afternoons and pretty much anywhere else in the city at other times, Dexter Shaw sells quality men's hats — fedoras, porkpies, newsboy caps, and more — to neighborhood types looking for a snazzy addition to their style. Satisfaction is 100% guaranteed.",USA
New York,buy,Everything's Very African,"Perhaps be a more accurate name for this place would be ""Everything's Very African-American"" — while they stock a token selection of tribal-themed decorative items as well as shea butter shampoo and body lotion, you won't find any dashiki, kaftans, or other such items here. Instead, this Broadway Market fashion boutique features a range of smart urban styles that walk the line between upscale elegance and street-level sass, with fancy dresses and ladies' hats as well as some really nice gold jewelry.",USA
New York,buy,Gridlock Lacquer,"With Gridlock Lacquer, Lisa Menchetti offers a full line of specialty hand-mixed nail polishes in colors and designs that pay tribute to the mighty industrial history and rich culture of Buffalo — only here can you adorn your nails with the vibrant colors of ""Loganberry"", ""The Blizzard of '77"", and the Polish-themed ""Smingus Dyngus"". All products are cruelty-free and made with ingredients sourced from U.S.-based suppliers, and they contain no toxic formaldehyde. And if you're visiting from another Rust Belt city, they have Rochester-, Pittsburgh-, and Cleveland-themed collections as well.",USA
New York,buy,The Custom Hatter,"The Custom Hatter is an institution that's been quietly prospering among the decline of the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood for over three decades: it's where owner Gary Witkowski practices the fast-disappearing craft of old-style hatmaking. A lifelong East Sider, Witkowski came up in the retail industry as a salesman and buyer in the hat department of upscale downtown clothier '''Peller & Mure''' — that's where he first came to an appreciation for fine men's hats, which he later honed as an apprentice to master milliner Henry Goldstein of Lynn, Massachusetts before striking out on his own in 1980. Today, in addition to the countless neighborhood residents he has helped to cap off (as it were) a formal ensemble in just the right way, Witkowski can boast of having outfitted big-budget Broadway shows like ''Guys & Dolls'' and ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', of his hats being worn on the big screen by stars like James Garner and Leonardo DiCaprio, and of his store being lauded in the pages of the ''New York Times'' and ''Fortune'' magazine. Orders are called in from around the country for fedoras, porkpies, homburgs, and other hats — all crafted on antique millinery tools — but if you're in the market for one yourself, this pleasant, well-lit store is stocked floor-to-ceiling with selections. Prices rank decisively in the high-end, but what you're paying for is quality that's second-to-none: Witkowski's workmanship hearkens back to the old school, using real beaver, chinchilla and muskrat fur with linings and leather sweatbands carefully sewn in place, rather than glued.",USA
New York,buy,Shoe Heaven,"Tucked away in plain sight in a low-hung, unassuming building next to '''St. John Kanty Catholic Church''', Shoe Heaven is a one-stop shop for sassy ladies' footwear in bright colors and daring designs. Dominating the inventory inside this bright, airy, well-kept shop are platform heels and wedges, but you can find lots of pumps, sandals, flats, and other styles too. Shoe Heaven's staff engages their customers with service that is always warm and gracious, and the merchandise is suitable for all budgets: nothing is priced higher than $60!",USA

New York,buy,Al Baraka Halal Meat & Food,"Serving a growing immigrant community on the East Side from a stall in the traditionally-Polish Broadway Market, Al Baraka's kitchen-sink list of merchandise consists of flours and grains, a huge selection of teas, dried fruits and legumes, fruit juices and other cold drinks, a small selection of halal meats, and more and more. Products from India and the Middle East are the main attraction, but there are also East Asian groceries to choose from as well. Staff is friendly as can be.",USA
New York,buy,Broadway Seafood & Meat,"Situated along the back wall of the Market with one large cooler for seafood and one for meat, Broadway Seafood & Meat is ''huge''. The latter cooler has pretty much every kind of butcher meat you can think of, including unusual items like rabbit and soul-food staples like hamhocks, pigs' feet, turkey necks and chitlins; the former proudly displays fresh whole fish on ice (again, pretty much every kind you can think of; the selection of freshwater whitefish is especially good), as well as huge five-pound fish fillets, crab legs that come fresh or packaged, and homemade hush puppies for a side dish. Service is prompt and friendly, and prices have to be seen to be believed.",USA
New York,buy,Camellia Meats,"Aside from the stand-alone location in Humboldt Park they expanded to in 2013, Camellia Meats' Broadway Market stall is still alive and kicking, with a full range of the same high-quality, low-price fresh meats you can get at the other place. Yes, that includes the award-winning house-brand '''Cichocki's''' Polish sausage.",USA
New York,buy,Deb's Delights,"Drawing on her background in the catering business as well as her talents in the kitchen, Debra Dechert took up canning as a hobby in 1989. Little did she know that a quarter-century later it would turn into a lucrative business for her: Deb's Delights ships its inventory nationwide from their headquarters in East Aurora, and their products sit on the shelves at numerous supermarkets in the Western New York Area in addition to its flagship retail outlet that opens for business each Wednesday at the Broadway Market. What products make up that inventory? No less than 70 different varieties of jellies, relishes, salsas, hot sauces, condiments, and — above all — pretty much any kind of vegetable that can be pickled; a high-quality range of stuff that ably demonstrates the truth of her slogan, ""If you can't, I can"".",USA
New York,buy,Famous Horseradish,"Sure, at this longtime Broadway Market vendor you can pick up a jar of the delicious, zesty namesake product which can otherwise be found in supermarkets all over the area, as well as harder-to-find beet horseradish. But Famous Horseradish also stocks a full range of horseradish-infused products like spicy mustard and cocktail sauce, as well as a variety of homemade pickles and sauerkraut. The remaining space on the shelves is filled out by a selection of fresh produce that's similar to the kind of stuff you'll find at '''Lewandowski's''', but reduced in variety and quantity — though naturally, if you're in the market for fresh horseradish root you're in luck.",USA
New York,buy,Keeping Traditions,"Keeping Traditions is the project of brother-and-sister team Greg and Julie Czochara, who keep alive their late mother's traditional pierogi recipe (hence the name) that their family enjoyed every Christmas: they handmake hundreds of these dumplings a day in their facility in Tonawanda, fresh-freeze them, and ship them to a growing roster of local stores and supermarkets as well as selling them directly to the public at the Broadway Market, on Saturdays from mid-November through Easter (unlike the majority of the vendors at the Market, Christmastime is Keeping Traditions' high season; they're here daily around the holidays). The pierogi these folks make are pretty hefty — around 5 inches (13cm) in size on average — and come with a variety of fillings including farmer cheese, cheddar cheese, onion, potato, sauerkraut, mushroom, and various combinations of the above, as well as special varieties that change from month to month.",USA
New York,buy,Kissed by the Sun Spice Company,"Kissed by the Sun Spice Company was born in 1999, when owner Liz Fickhesen fell in love with the bold, zesty flavors of the Caribbean while on vacation in Tortola. True to form, these all-natural, all-kosher, pesticide- and MSG-free spice blends are the perfect accompaniment to island cuisine (their website even has an online cookbook for some ideas). Kissed by the Sun's biggest sellers are their seasoned sea salt blend with garlic, celery seed, parsley and a hint of ginger — a healthy alternative to table salt with one-third the sodium — as well as the sweet-hot pepper flakes made from the skins of red and jalapeño peppers, flavorful yet not too spicy.",USA
New York,buy,Lewandowski Produce,"Open six days a week, this longtime Broadway Market vendor is the place to come if you want fresh fruits and vegetables. Most of what you'll find at Lewandowski's is fairly standard produce-section stuff — onions, potatoes, lettuce, broccoli, peppers, and other stuff that will do you well if you plan to whip up a delicious Polish meal, as well as apples, oranges, bananas — but there are some more interesting finds as well, especially when it comes to root vegetables (rutabaga and yams are ubiquitous) and a surprising selection of unroasted nuts and fresh herbs. Lewandowski's also stocks a small variety of honey, jams, and preserves.",USA
New York,buy,Lupas Meats,"When it comes to Broadway Market butcher shops, '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' may have size and variety on their side, but these guys have the crowds. The venerable stand operated by family patriarch Petru Lupas and his son, David, is an old-school operation — ""as close as you can get to the original Broadway Market"", in the words of one reviewer who grew up in Polonia during its golden years — and the constant hustle and bustle of customers testifies to the quality of what they sell. Lupas sells meats that are handcut daily, and the stars of the show are (of course) Polish delicacies such as fresh and smoked kielbasa, ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and slab bacon. This is also a place to find workmanlike cuts like oxtails, neckbones, hog jowls, chicken feet and other stuff that you can't get at fancy-shmancy places elsewhere, as well as soul-food cuts that cater to an incresingly African-American customer base. In terms of deli meats, bologna, ham, and other pork products abound, as do local brands: '''Wardynski's''' and '''Sahlen's''' wieners, '''Russer''' ham and bologna, '''Yancey's Fancy''' deli cheeses, and Lupas' own house brand. To cut down on the already low prices, you might opt for one of the variety packs if you're buying a large quantity, or else show up late in the day, when prices are reduced to move as much inventory as possible.",USA
New York,buy,Malczewski's,"In Buffalo, Malczewski's is synonymous with the local tradition of the ''baranek wielkanocny'', or butter lamb — the centerpiece of the traditional Easter breakfast spread, it's a block of butter sculpted by hand into the shape of a lamb (symbolic of the ""Lamb of God"" of Catholic iconography), with a red ribbon tied around its neck (a symbol of the blood of Christ) and a red-and-white Alleluia flag stuck in its back. The butter lamb is a tradition native to several Eastern European lands, but on this side of the Atlantic it's unique to Buffalo. Since Mr. and Mrs. Malczewski retired in 2013, '''Camellia Meats''' has taken over the making of the butter lambs, as well as the rest of the operations at this old-school Broadway Market food stall: all your favorite Polish specialties are represented, from homemade pierogi and ''kluski'' noodles to ''kiszka'', ''kapusta'', ''czernina'', farmers' cheese, and smoked hams.",USA
New York,buy,Pierogi by Paula,"In her hometown of North Tonawanda, Paula Duge grew up with the tradition of helping her mother make traditional Polish pierogi for their Easter morning breakfast. Today, the savory dumplings she whips up at her facility in suburban Rochester are still made by hand using authentic ingredients and the secret Kurasiewicz family recipe — ""just like Babci made"", as the saying goes. Whether it be traditional savory fillings like potato, sauerkraut, or imported farmers' cheese or dessert pierogi stuffed with fruit preserves, they're all preservative-free and delicious. Paula's sister Judy handles the Buffalo-area operations of Pierogi by Paula, including its presence at the Broadway Market every Saturday. (If you're here on Tuesday or Friday, the folks at '''White Eagle Bakery''' have a key and can get you pierogi from the freezer case.)",USA
New York,buy,Spices by Milly,"Spices by Milly offers up a selection of spices and herbs that dwarfs what you can find on the shelves of your average supermarket, and whose chef-level quality comes from the hours of research the owner puts in on the ideal physical characteristics and preparation and storage methods for each of her individual products. That's just the beginning of the story, though: Milly also stocks a huge range of prepared goodies like cooking oils, salad dressings and dips, hot sauces and salsas, dehydrated vegetables, a range of premium quality herbal teas (including decaffeinated varieties), and powdered soup and gravy mixes based on her own family recipes.",USA
New York,buy,A.D. Asian Variety Mart,"In business on Sycamore Street since 2009, the Bengali-language sign that adorns the front of the building testifies to the origin of owner Muhammad Munshi, to the identity of the immigrant community it serves, and to the type of goods that you can find inside. Namely, the merchandise at A.D. consists of halal groceries from all over the Indian Subcontinent and the Middle East, with an emphasis on meats including chicken, beef, lamb, goat and more. As well, you can pick up a range of fresh produce and Asian spices.",USA

New York,buy,Al-Madina Grocery & Variety Store,"Halal meats such as chicken, beef and fish are proudly touted on the sign in front of this little Bengali-owned store, as well as fresh produce that's locally sourced in many cases. But the true essence of Al-Madina is that it's very much a regular grocery store, only scaled down in size, with all products certified halal and a small variety of ethnic goods too. As well, you can find housewares and toiletries here including pots and pans, dish soap, baby powder, shampoo, and the like.",USA
New York,buy,Foodland,"This Middle Eastern and South Asian food shop opened in late 2014 at the far east end of the new shopping plaza at the corner of Broadway and Sweet Avenue. At Foodland you'll find a mix of specialty groceries including halal meat and fish, fresh produce, spices and frozen foods. As well, they always have a pot of hot coffee on.",USA
New York,buy,Kamuna International Grocery,"Opened in 2013 in the former home of '''Dick Haberl's Tire Center''' in Schiller Park and moved three years later to its current location in the heart of the East Side's immigrant community, this place's name is something of a misnomer: the inventory at Kamuna International Groceries consists mostly of standard bodega fare like cold drinks and packaged snacks. But there is a small selection of halal meats and other Arabian and African food items, as well as ethnic clothing, shea butter and other toiletries.",USA
New York,buy,Wilson Street Urban Farm,"Wilson Street Urban Farm comprises 25 lots on the west side of Wilson Street between Broadway and Sycamore: about two acres (a little less than a hectare) of land tilled by the Stevens family, who, as transplants to Buffalo from the rural areas outside the city, use their agricultural know-how to serve as mentors and role models to a growing movement of like-minded homesteaders. The farm grows a wide range of produce such as turnips, arugula, cucumbers, peas, carrots, kohlrabi, onions, garlic, beans, leafy greens and herbs, both outdoors in the ground as well as inside their custom-built hothouse. While about half of the harvest goes to feed the nine-member Stevens family themselves, they offer the rest up for sale on Saturday mornings at their farm stand, which is one of the best places in the neighborhood to get fresh seasonal veggies — indeed, the mission statement of the farm is to ""make fresh, local, naturally-grown produce readily available to Buffalo's East Side"".",USA
New York,buy,Chruściki Bakery,"At the Broadway Market, countless Polish confectioners have come and gone over the years, but the Chruściki Bakery is the stalwart original that (despite a marked decline in service and quality over the years) still keeps folks lining up all year long, but especially in the weeks leading up to Easter, to satisfy their sweet tooth. The titular item that earned this place their stature is ''chruściki'', otherwise known as ""angel wings"" — flat strips of dough twisted into ribbon shapes, deep-fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar; a light-as-air deliciousness — but you can also pick up ''pączki'', ''placek'', ''makowiec'', and ''mazurek'', as well as home-baked rye bread, pierogi, and full hot breakfasts. The Chruściki Bakery also has locations in Kenmore and Lancaster.",USA
New York,buy,Franklin's Kettle Korn,"Kettle corn is the specialty that gave this longtime Broadway Market stall its name: it comes in three sizes and in regular, cinnamon, and extra-sweet flavors.

New York,buy,Melanie's Sweets Unlimited,"Scratch-made cakes, pastries and cookies come out of the oven all day at Melanie Krygier's sweet shop, which has been open here at 999 Broadway since 1978. Melanie's specialty is ""lamb cakes"": lamb-shaped slabs of pound cake drizzled in a sweet sugar glaze and frosted with a white coconut icing.",USA
New York,buy,Strawberry Island,"""We'll dip anything in chocolate"" is the saying around here, and at Strawberry Island that can mean anything from marshmallow Peeps, to roasted nuts, to Twinkies, to the fresh strawberries that gave this place its name. But that's just the beginning of the story: this old-time candy shop stocks all the sweets you remember from the halcyon days of your youth — jelly beans, saltwater taffy, crispy sugar waffles, fudge — as well as only-in-Buffalo specialties like sponge candy (available in regular, dark chocolate or orange chocolate) and Charlie Chaplins (a mix of marshmallows, roasted cashews, and coconut flakes covered in chocolate fudge and sprinkled with coarse salt).",USA
New York,buy,Sweet Temptations du Jour,"Barbara Keating started out whipping up small batches of family-recipe Polish pastries like ''makowiec'' and selling them at craft shows and farmers' markets around the area, but today Sweet Temptations du Jour has expanded to an eclectic array of sweets representing culinary traditions from across Europe — German ''pfefferneusse'' spice cookies, Russian teacakes, Italian ''cugidati'', and Croatian-style apple strudel are just a few of the concoctions available by special order from the website. As for the Broadway Market stand where you can find Keating every Saturday, it stocks a limited slate of changing selections from Sweet Temptations' oeuvre, always including the specialty of the house: light, crunchy sugar waffles dipped in chocolate and topped with candied nuts, dubbed ""Sweet Nuthings"". Chocolate-covered kettle corn is another big seller.

New York,buy,White Eagle Bakery,"Owned since 1925 by four generations of the same family, White Eagle Bakery is most famous for their ''chruściki'', the familiar red-and-white boxes of which adorn the shelves at '''Wegmans''' and other area supermarkets in the runup to Easter. But these folks sell the whole lineup of Polish pastries: ''placek'', strudel, cream horns, pastry hearts, cakes and pies, and the seasonal favorite ''pączki'' which flies off the shelves from Fat Tuesday all the way through to Easter Sunday. As well, a close second to ''chruściki'' on the list of customers' favorite White Eagle products is the wholesome, soft-crust seeded Polish rye bread baked fresh daily. If you're in town at the beginning of the week, come see these folks at their other location, '''D&L Bakery''' in Depew.",USA

New York,buy,Prestige Furniture,"""Louie the Furniture Man"" is the guy you want to see at Prestige, which has been going strong in St. John Kanty since 1970.

New York,buy,Theresa's Treasures for the Home,"The name of this shop is a bit of a misnomer: the main stock in trade at Theresa's Treasures for the Home is a collection of jewelry that runs toward the loud and gaudy (sometimes hilariously so) — large, brightly-colored, and obviously fake gemstones that wouldn't look out of place at a Mardi Gras parade. Kitsch abounds in the housewares selection too: there are lots of porcelain decorative figurines and kitchenware, cut glass dishes & goblets, and trinkets such as solar powered dancing animals. If you're among the Eastertime crowds at the Broadway Market, you'll also find painted wooden Easter eggs and other seasonal fare.",USA

New York,buy,Cedars Bakery,"This combination Lebanese food market and lunch counter is housed in a nondescript, low-slung brick building in an industrial section of Lovejoy, so it's easy to miss. Don't, though — the tasty Mediterranean specialties manufactured, sold and served at Cedars bakery have earned every single one of the many raves that Buffalo foodies have tossed their way since the place opened in 1981. Originally located on Niagara Street in the West Side, co-owners James and Andrew Issa, a pair of brothers that represent the second generation in this family-owned enterprise, moved to Dingens Street in 2001 and also run a branch location in Orchard Park. These folks are known for their pita bread — baked onsite daily and among the freshest in the city — but Cedars is a place where you can get pretty much any ingredient you need to whip up your own tasty Mediterranean meal: imported olive oil, ''dolmades'' (grape leaves), ''labneh'' (strained yogurt), hummus, tahini, and a freezer section fully stocked with goodies like falafel mix, prepared ''spanakopita'' pies, and more. The lunch counter serves freshly prepared pita sandwiches, wraps, and savory meat pies.",USA
New York,buy,European Deli,"With proud red and white flags decorating the front window and ads for '''Żywiec''' beer posted all over the walls, it's not hard to guess what's stocked at this small, charming Kaisertown shop: all things Polish and edible. The European Deli's owner, Teresa Ignatowska, is a Warsaw native who met her husband when he was an American tourist, and she started the shop as a way of keeping in contact with her Polish roots after moving to Buffalo in 1971. This place keeps odd hours, only open during the end of the week, but if you're around at the right time you can take advantage of the huge selection of meats that's the European Deli's biggest draw. Front and center is the ''kielbasa'', which comes fresh, smoked, double-smoked, and in a few flavored varieties such as garlic. You can also find ''kabanosy'', ''kiszka'', ''saucison'', Krakus ham, and other delicacies. Polish pastry and baked goods are also popular — including ''makowiec'' (poppyseed cake), ''pączki'' (doughnut-like pastries stuffed with fruit preserves, especially popular around Fat Tuesday), and hearty rye bread — and you'll also find farmer cheese, herbal tea, and Polish-language books, greeting cards, and videos. Everything sold here is imported directly from Poland, and much of it can't be found anywhere else in Buffalo.",USA
New York,buy,Federal Bakers,"True to its name, Federal Bakers stocks a variety of provisions for amateur bakers and expert pastry chefs alike.

Federal Bakers also carries a selection of ready-to-eat prepared desserts in its modest-sized freezer section.",USA
New York,buy,Slavic Bazaar,"Slavic Bazaar is ''the'' place for Eastern European groceries in Buffalo, but don't be fooled by the painting on the side of the building of a pig in a frying pan: while fresh meats are indeed sold here, the selection is more modest than, say, '''European Deli''' on Clinton Street. Where Slavic Bazaar excels is in canned and packaged groceries, as well as frozen foods. Unlike the aforementioned European Deli, the selection here goes far beyond Poland: foods from Kashuba's native Ukraine as well as Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Latvia, and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe are well-represented on the shelves. Canned vegetables, snacks, chocolate, pickled products, jarred fruit preserves, and spice mixes abound, along with an ample wall of freezers stocked with pierogi homemade in the factory behind the store, frozen ''borscht'' and other soups, savory ''pelmeni'', and more. As for that modest selection of meats, there's a deli counter where you can get ''salo'', ''kiszka'', ''kabanosy'' and other favorites, as well as a small walk-in cooler with things like smoked fish fillets and Bulgarian ''kashkaval'' cheese. And if you happen to work up an appetite shopping for your favorite Eastern European imports, Slavic Bazaar also has a lunch counter where you can sink your teeth into mouth-watering pierogi (cooked in the Ukrainian style, smaller and denser than their Polish cousins), hot, sizzling sausage, and more.",USA
New York,buy,B West Studio,"Founded in Allentown in 2006 and moved to its current home in 2014, B West Studio is the project of local artist Peter Caruso. In addition to Caruso's own work — characterized most often by energetic yet anonymous crowd scenes, rendered in acrylic paint in a style indebted to 19th-century Impressionism and often including familiar Buffalo streetscapes as a setting — B West's gallery space in the heart of Kaisertown also displays an eclectic range of works by other artists from Buffalo and around the region, with an emphasis on student works. Many of the high-quality pieces displayed in the gallery are available for sale, generally at $400 or less. Special exhibits are held on a monthly basis.",USA
New York,buy,Kaisertown Crafts and Gifts,"With a background in garment production and an accomplished career as a seamstress behind her, Elisabeth von Hahn emigrated to Buffalo from Germany in 1999 and opened this cute little shop a few years later. In the words of the website, Hahn's mission to ""for the younger generation to learn the crafts that are dying out in this modern era"", so instead of focusing exclusively on popular or trendy pursuits such as knitting and cross-stitching, Kaisertown Crafts and Gifts carries supplies for a wide range of different crafts. If you're into spinning, weaving, quilting, lacemaking, or paper crafts such as stamping or Cricut, this is the place for you — they even cater to jewelry and stained-glass artisans! Even if you're not in the market to buy anything, Kaisertown Crafts and Gifts is a busy place: craft instructor Dawn Flammger comes by on a frequent basis to host classes in knitting, cardmaking, and scrapbooking, and the store even welcomes DIY types anytime during business hours for ""open crafting"", where you can pursue your craft in-store and even borrow Kaisertown Crafts' rubber and acrylic stamps, embossing folders and Cricut cartridges for a nominal price. They do alterations, too, and as for the ""gifts"" half of the equation, a range of porcelain figurines, plush toys, knitted items, books, handbags and accessories are stocked.",USA
New York,buy,The 11th Hour,"Tucked away in an easy-to-miss storefront near '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the motto at The 11th Hour is ""Where Fashion Meets Style"" — and the style in question is more urban than urban. On the pastel-pink racks at this nicely-decorate boutique you'll find a compendium of edgy, eye-popping, envelope-pushing pieces, each color brighter and each pattern louder than the next: these jeans, tops, bodysuits, shoes, and accessories are for those who want to make a real statement, and decidedly ''not'' for those who don't like to wear their clothes skintight. Personal styling services are also offered.",USA
New York,buy,Signature Apparel & Footwear,"Since 2009, this large Bailey Avenue clothing emporium has been a destination for urban athletic wear and street-level styles that are often preppier than other fashion boutiques on the East Side. At Signature you'll find a wide selection of shoes, as well as ''lots'' of name brands: Polo, Timberland, Champion, New Era, and Levi's are only some of them.",USA
New York,buy,Al Madina,"From the outside, this little place in Humboldt Park looks like the perfect spot to pick up a cold pop, candy bar or salty snack — and indeed, if you're in the market for something like that, you won't be disappointed. But Al Madina is much more than just another corner bodega. The sign outside the door boasts of an international selection of groceries that encompasses ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Arabian, Nepali, African, Spanish, and American"" goods, but in reality, the accent here is decidedly on Middle Eastern and South Asian foods — principally halal meats and fish, spices, and a modest selection of fresh produce. Al Madina is also a source for clothing, both including both Western and traditional Muslim garb.",USA
New York,buy,Appletree Halal Market,"Appletree Halal Market's main claim to fame is some of the best takeout halal food you'll find in Western New York: a range of Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes including chicken, goat and lamb curries, biryani, and even halal pizza are ladled out for you from steam trays for some jaw-droppingly low prices. But if you'd rather try your hand at making your own version of this delicious cuisine, have no fear: Appletree stocks everything you need, from fresh meats to vegetables to an amazing selection of spices, plus hummus and tahini, fresh pita bread, delicious fruit juices, frozen foods, and more. You can even find traditional Muslim clothing such as ''hijabs'' and ''abayat'' here. What really sets Appletree apart, though, is the warm and helpful service provided by owner Mohsin: a friendly, larger-than-life character who imbues the place with a boisterous spirit that's light-years from the taciturn surliness of other halal food store personnel.",USA
New York,buy,Bailey Avenue Café and Bake Shoppe,"At Bailey Avenue Café and Bake Shoppe you can get a great variety of cakes, pies, cookies, brownies, and other sweet treats, as well as prepared sandwiches and wraps and even soul-food dinners such as catfish fillets and fried chicken, served and/or sold to you in a spotlessly clean environment by folks who are as courteous as can be. But that's not the real reason you should visit: instead, stop in to show support for the work of '''Saving Grace Ministries''', who operates the shop as a job training service for their staff of formerly homeless individuals.",USA
New York,buy,Camellia Meats,"Camellia Meats was born in 1935, when Edmund Cichocki, a longtime butcher for '''Slawinski Meats''' at the '''Broadway Market''', struck out on his own, selling his own family-recipe Polish sausage and ham. Over eighty years later, the business is still run by the third generation of the same family — and while you can get all the same stuff today as you could back then (the merchandise still trends toward Polish specialties such as ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and the aforementioned Polish sausage which has gone on to win many awards), and the Camellia of today carries a full line of over fifty fresh-cut meats both at their Broadway Market outlet and the stand-alone shop that opened on Genesee Street in 2013. This gargantuan meat market boasts a 40-foot (12m) refrigerated display case and a row of freezers on the back wall, selling multitudinous cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and fish, deli meats and cheeses, and a small selection of fresh produce and prepared foods. If you're planning to make a large purchase, take advantage of their discounted package specials.",USA
New York,buy,Jawani Market,"Located on Fillmore Avenue in Humboldt Park, Jawani is a halal grocery store and bakery that carries a modest selection of Middle Eastern specialty foods — with an accent on halal meats such as goat, lamb, chicken and fish — alongside an otherwise bodegalike selection of candy, snacks, cold pop, cigarettes, and the like. Fresh produce is also sold.",USA
New York,buy,Pickles & Peppers,"A family-operated urban farm operated under the auspices of the '''Farmer Pirates''' collective, Pickles & Peppers is situated on a six-acre (2.5 ha) plot near the border of Genesee-Moselle and Broadway-Fillmore that's shared with Farmer Pirates' '''central composting facility'''. Owners Alex and Dan grow a range of hot peppers and other vegetables that they sell fresh, dried, pickled and prepared into a wide range of artisanal hot sauces at a seasonally-operated farm stand on Gittere Street. You can also pick up fruits from the orchard located on the same site: several dozen heirloom apple, cherry, and pear trees as well as berry bushes do double duty as a haven for area wildlife.",USA
New York,buy,Walden Halal Groceries,"At this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', you'll find a mix of ethnic specialty groceries from the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent that prominently includes a range of hand-slaughtered halal meats of superior variety, quality, and freshness: lamb, chicken, beef, and more are available directly to customers or sold wholesale to area restaurants. If you have a specific order in mind, you can even deliver it to the store via text and they'll have it waiting for you when you arrive. As well, Walden Halal Groceries also sells fresh produce, an impressive variety of spices, and bodega fare such as snacks, candy, and cold drinks. The store closes during Friday prayers, and customer service is limited by the staff's tenuous grasp of English, but this is still a good place to go for fans of Asian and Arabian cuisine.",USA
New York,buy,The Guild @ 980,"The Guild @ 980 is operated out of a 100-year-old factory building on the historic Belt Line Railroad by '''ReUse Action''', a group that splintered off of '''Buffalo ReUse''' in 2011 but shares much the same ''raison d'être'': salvaging construction materials, architectural elements, and furnishings from soon-to-be-demolished homes, refurbishing them, and offering them up for sale to the next generation of home builders, thereby preserving the old-fashioned craftsmanship of the original items while simultaneously conserving raw materials and preventing waste from building up in landfills. If you're in the middle of a home construction project, The Guild offers your pick of old doors, windows, wooden beams, bathtubs, sinks, floor tile, light fixtures, and the like — and if not, you can still peruse a pretty nifty selection of antique furniture and home decor. The Guild also boasts a small third-floor gallery space described above.",USA
New York,buy,Ansar Cellular Communication & Fragrance,"The main attraction at this crowded, jumbled Fillmore Avenue bodega is a range of prepaid cell phones and calling plans, but Ansar also carries a wide range of specialty fragrances, toiletries and household items for the Arabian and African community that has coalesced in Humboldt Park: here you can find incense, rose attar and other fragrant essential oils, oil burners, shea butter soaps, and the list goes on. The picture is completed by the optimistic go-getter personality of owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur: whether expounding on his personal philosophy of ""do for self"" or just chitchatting with his customers, his spirited presence is a delight to visitors to Ansar.",USA
New York,buy,Hobby Boyz,"You would never imagine that such an interesting, eclectic and high-quality range of merchandise would be available in a ramshackle brownstone storefront in Delavan-Grider, but stop in to Hobby Boyz and your expectations will surely be exceeded. Browse the shelves and you'll notice that the accent here is on supplies for hobbyists: the selection of remote-control cars and airplanes, scale-model hobby kits, and supplies for collectors holds its own with any other outlet in Western New York. If what you're aiming for is something a bit more active, Hobby Boyz is also an authorized dealer and repairer of Razor brand scooters (both electric and nonmotorized); they stock a full line of accessories and safety equipment too, as well as skateboards, dirt bikes, Minimoto bikes, ATVs, and pretty much anything else you can think of on wheels. But it gets even more diverse than that: as if to really emphasize the ""variety"" in owner Richard Wagstaff's slogan, ""a new-style variety store"", you'll find a full line of car stereos and audio equipment, designer clothes, video games, DVDs, hair-care products, convenience-store snacks, and a ridiculously ample range of other goods.",USA
New York,buy,Leslie's One Man's Junk Is Another Man's Treasure Boutique,"Simply put, Leslie Thomas' small, friendly Fillmore Avenue boutique is a gold mine for folks in search of high-quality vintage items: secondhand skirts, blouses, fancy dresses, shoes and even menswear are available for a song, as well as housewares and decorative items. Donations are graciously accepted, too — as the store's credo goes, ""the value in a person is in what he gives, not what he receives"".",USA
New York,buy,Our World,"On and off since 1969 — when he's had the spare time to put into running it, on top of working his primary job — Our World Boutique has been Harry Stokes' own labor of love. Its latest iteration opened in 2009, in the same building the shop was in when it last closed its doors in 1987, but the inventory on the shelves remains the same as ever: Our World was described in a ''Buffalo Rising'' writeup as being ""dedicated to a world of ethnic delights"", but really that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Instead, the ''huge'' range of items stocked here are a magnificent reflection of the vitality of Buffalo's African-American community in all its facets. ""Diaspora gifts"" of all descriptions are the name of the game here: from African-inspired artwork, housewares, and decorative knickknacks, to toiletry items like black and shea butter soaps and a range of natural body oils and creams, to scarves, kaftans and other clothing. But if Our World's inventory has one singular strong point, it's literature — Bibles, Korans, and books touching on African-American themes abound; those interested in local African-American news and views can pick up copies of the ''Challenger'', ''Criterion'', or ''Final Call''; and, above all, they stock Buffalo's largest selection of Afrocentric greeting cards, with over a dozen series represented. The vivacious personality of Our World's owner is matched by the vivacious colors on the outer walls of the building: proud, bright reds, oranges, greens and blues, inspired in equal measures by the attractive storefronts of Elmwood Avenue and other fashionable shopping districts, as well as the vibrant hues of Africa. This place is truly one of a kind.",USA
New York,eat,Auntie's Jamaican Restaurant,"Auntie's has flaws, but they're worth overlooking. The place keeps odd hours and is helmed by an owner who's known to be cranky with customers from time to time, but the food is delicious and the menu is much wider-ranging than other area Jamaican restaurants. You'll certainly find what you're looking for at Auntie's if you're in the mood for one of the basic standards, like jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail, or escoveitch fish, but if you're feeling more adventurous, they also have harder-to-find selections like curry shrimp, ackee and saltfish, and red snapper. Best of all, Auntie makes her own ginger beer; if you're not in the mood for that, other drinks include sorrel, Irish moss, and healthy carrot and cucumber juices. Dessert adds a strong Southern/Creole accent to the proceedings, courtesy of options like banana bread and homemade sweet potato pudding.",USA
New York,eat,Baba's Place,"Baba's Place opened in 1989 as '''Sam's Express''' and has been serving ""ethnically influenced comfort food"" (their words, and perhaps the best possible description of the fare served there) under their current name since 2001. This is a tiny little restaurant with only a few tables, but that just makes the selection of food available there all the more impressive: a mélange of Greek and American specialties that come in portions that are huge and prices that aren't, and are served quickly and efficiently by friendly staff. Buffalo Greek diner staples such as gyro and souvlaki are served the traditional way — with pita bread and a Greek salad on the side — or you can get them on sub rolls. They're equally good either way. Baba's Place serves a range of other pita-pocket sandwiches and ""pita tacos"" as well, plus shish kebabs and a truly delicious rice pudding; vegetarians will be pleasantly surprised by the range of meat-free options here, such as falafel and ''spanakopita'' (spinach pie layered in ''phyllo'' dough). Consensus says the American food served here isn't quite as good as the Greek, but you can get a selection of hot and cold subs and melt sandwiches, as well as Asian-influenced selections such as your choice of chicken, beef or shrimp stir-fried over rice.",USA
New York,eat,Bailey Fish & Seafood,"Bailey Fish and Seafood is the only seafood restaurant on the East Side — and the only one it needs. There's no indoor seating here, so you'll have to take your food back to the hotel with you, often braving seemingly endless lines to do so (especially on Fridays, when their topnotch fish fry packs the house) — but it's worth it. Why? Simply put, the food here is ''really, really good'': the freshest, tastiest seafood Buffalo has to offer, with shipments of high-quality product arriving daily from all over the United States. The marquee item at Bailey Seafood is the ""Haddock Super Sandwich"", a feast that truly lives up to its superlative name: a gargantuan fried filet on a locally baked '''Costanzo's''' bun, topped with tangy coleslaw and homemade French fries, big enough for two people to share yet at a price of only $5. This and other sandwiches are frequently ordered in combos (or, for larger parties, ""family packs"") where the already excellent value for your money is improved further. Dinnertime at Bailey Seafood sees mains like breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp skewers, crawfish, steamed clams, and various fish filets served ''à la carte'' or in combo packs, and they even sell fresh fish and one-, two-, and five-pound packs of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters if you're planning an event. Meanwhile, the slate of appetizers and sides is where the Southern and Creole influences that pervade Bailey Seafood's menu come out best: try the hush puppies, mac & cheese, fried okra, or homemade sweet potato pie if you want a sample. Service is quick and friendly especially considering the unrelenting crowds the staff has to deal with; if you want to make it easier on them and yourself, you can call ahead or order online and they'll have your food waiting for you when you arrive.",USA
New York,eat,Caribbean Experience,"With a multitude of '''Taste of Buffalo''' awards under its belt and a strong claim on the title of best Jamaican food in town, the ""experience"" here is astoundingly good, if a bit strange at first. The odd way the restaurant is set up is usually the first impression for first-time visitors to Caribbean Experience: the front room is a handsome if usually empty bar with a pool table, and the counter where you order your food is in the back (ring the buzzer in front to get the owner's attention). In between is a large dining room, sparsely but pleasantly decorated with Jamaican flags adorning the dark wood panelling of the walls. The food served here earns no points for innovation — Caribbean Experience's menu sticks to the standards, but does so with aplomb. The jerk chicken is flavored perfectly, not overpowering in its spiciness but with a meaty, somewhat smoky aroma and none of the sweetness that occasionally pops up at places like '''Curly's''' or the recently closed '''Mangoz''', and the culinary excellence carries over to the other selections as well: curry goat, brown stew chicken, oxtail, escoveitch fish, and a few others. Authenticity is the rule, and portion sizes are huge especially considering the prices. All meals are served with fried plantains, red beans and rice (they'll cover it with delicious, spicy jerk gravy if you want — highly recommended), and steamed cabbage; all your favorite island beverages are offered as well, from ginger beer to Irish moss to rum punch.",USA
New York,eat,The Fire Spot,"Opened in 2016 in a restored building on Bailey Avenue, The Fire Spit's name is apropos — not only is its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter, but he valiantly persevered with his dream of operating a family-owned restaurant even after an electrical fire ripped through the building just before the planned opening of the restaurant, setting him back two full years. But, what does The Fire Spot serve? Char-grilled hot dogs? Blazing-hot Mexican or Asian food? Wilkinson doesn't take the metaphor quite that far, but if you're in the mood for some delicious, homestyle soul food classics made fresh to order and served by one of the friendliest staffs of any restaurant in the city, this is a place you should check out. Though The Fire Spot does stay open through dinnertime, breakfast (all-day!) and lunch are the two busiest times of the day here: the biggest seller on the menu by far are the chicken and waffles, uniquely served with whole, unsplit wings fried up to crispy perfection (you can substitute tenders or traditional wings on request). At lunchtime, you can also try a delicious steak hoagie slathered in Wilkinson's own secret-recipe ""Tailgate Comeback Sauce""; if you've come with a bigger appetite, tuck into one of the combo platters on the dinner menu where fried chicken, haddock or shrimp come with your choice of Southern-style sides. The Fire Spot is a small place with only a few tables in the dining room, so come prepared for crowds or else you might consider getting your food to go.",USA
New York,eat,Mike's Steak Joint,"First off: if you're coming here with Ethiopian food in mind, you're going to be disappointed. Though some sources state otherwise, it seems that Mike's brief experiment with shoehorning Ethiopian specialties into his menu is permanently finished. However, if you're looking to nurse a hangover after a night of bar-hopping in nearby University Heights, the menu here is frequently described as a tastier and cheaper version of '''Jim's Steakout'''. As you might have inferred from the full name of the place, steak is the marquee ingredient: Mike's claim to have invented the steak taco is dubious at best, but that doesn't make it any less delicious, and the ""Steak in the Hood"" hoagie comes with pork sausage in addition to the titular filling. Aside from steak, Mike's serves a full range of hot and cold subs, burgers, sausage sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, and tacos. They deliver, too.",USA
New York,eat,Pho 99,"Founded in 1999 (hence the name) and located since 2003 on Bailey Avenue within walking distance of the '''South Campus''' of the '''University at Buffalo''', Pho 99 is Buffalo's first Vietnamese restaurant — and though it no longer can claim the title of the ''best'' place in town for this cuisine, it still does a brisk business especially with university students and faculty. Noodle bowls, fried rice plates, and meat-based entrees are all available, but this place's specialty is ''pho'', a Vietnamese soup made with rice noodles and flavored with bean sprouts, green chili peppers, basil and mint leaves, and lime juice. Raw beef is added to the soup; the piping hot broth cooks the beef before the soup is served. Consensus says the formerly impeccable quality of Pho 99's food took a hit after the place came under new management, but the fare here is still passable, and the service is friendly, if often slow.",USA
New York,eat,Kensington Avenue Pizzeria,"Kensington Avenue Pizzeria is a conundrum: locals' opinions on the place are among the most wildly mixed of any restaurant in Buffalo. They're equally likely to praise the deliciousness of the steak tacos and fettuccine Alfredo as to denounce the slow and inconsistent service, ""rough around the edges"" waitstaff, and high-ish prices. This place does earn points for their expansive menu, though — the sign outside the door reads ""the largest variety of pizzeria foods around"", which is too modest; this place's oeuvre spreads far beyond the realm of what you would usually find in a neighborhood pizza joint. Joining the usual stuff on the menu is a full range of hot and cold sandwiches, subs and burgers, Italian specialties like sausage cacciatore, shrimp scampi and various pasta dishes, Southern-style fried chicken, a selection of Greek souvlaki platters, steaks and porkchops, even Puerto Rican fare like ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil''. If you do feel like going the traditional route, though, the ""Kitchen Sink Pizza"" — with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham, onions, mushrooms, green and black olives, and sweet and hot peppers — is a winner if you're especially hungry. Breakfast is served daily till 2PM, and the place opens up on Sundays during football season to accommodate Bills fans.",USA
New York,eat,Dnipro Café,"Every Friday evening at the '''Dnipro Center''' — an ethnic club and gathering place for Buffalo's Ukrainian community for over eighty years — the spacious ''rathskeller'' is converted to a restaurant serving a mix of Ukrainian and American specialties. While they're decently executed, the American foods on the menu are mostly simple, uninspired fare that you could find in any roadside diner — hot and cold sandwiches, main-course salads, chicken fingers and wings, heartier dinners centered more often than not on deep-fried seafood — but you're at the Dnipro Center, so it'd be a crime anyway not to go ethnic. Start off with an appetizer of ''borscht'', then choose from a slate of options that includes ''holubtsi'' (cabbage rolls), ''varenyky'' (Ukrainian-style pierogi), and more — or, if you're really hungry, opt for the ""UKE Combo"" which combines both of the above plus savory ''kovbasa'' sausage, tangy sauerkraut, and dark rye bread.",USA
New York,eat,So Delicious,"At any time of day, you can come to this little place in Fillmore-Leroy — the old location of '''Taste of Soul''', which moved to Bailey Avenue in 2013 — for a full range of ""quick and delicious"" fast food, including burgers, chicken wings and fingers, pizza, tacos, hot and cold subs, and even Jamaican patties. But So Delicious also serves breakfast, and Saturday and Sunday evenings sees a heartier range of full-size soul-food dinners served up. The pleasant, well-lit dining room tops off the coziness of the So Delicious experience, decorated in warm hues of orange and brown.",USA
New York,eat,Taste of the Caribbean,"Located in the former home of '''Garris BBQ''' on William Street just outside of downtown, Taste of the Caribbean immediately took its place alongside '''Doctor Bird's Rasta-Rant''' and '''Caribbean Experience''' in the pantheon of Buffalo's best Jamaican restaurants when it opened in 2015. The menu doesn't stray too far from the standards — jerk chicken, escoveitch fish, oxtail, brown stew chicken, and various ""combo specials"" thereof, each of which come with peas and rice as well as your choice of two additional sides — and prices are a bit higher than the competition, but you get what you pay for. Everything is bursting with flavor: the jerk chicken is juicy, savory, and perfectly spiced (neither bland nor overpoweringly fiery); the peas and rice have an ineffably nutty aroma that is utterly tantalizing; even the steamed cabbage is delicious. Most of Taste of the Caribbean's business seems to be take-out, but there are about a dozen tables for seating in their dining room, which is brightly decorated with walls painted azure blue and colorful patterned tablecloths. Best of all, the grandmotherly Jamaican lady who works the counter is supremely friendly (she'll chat your ear off if you let her) and service is quick and efficient.",USA
New York,eat,Tony's Ranch House,"Open six days a week for breakfast and lunch, the somewhat misleadingly named Tony's Ranch House is a neighborhood institution where the Pitliangas family has served a full range of Greek and American diner fare since 1981 to a loyal clientele comprised of a mixture of neighborhood regulars, '''Sisters' Hospital''' employees, and '''Canisius College''' students. The menu sticks to the basic burgers and melt sandwiches, but throws in a few Greek specialties for good measure: chicken and beef souvlaki, gyro, ''spanakopita'', ''baklava'' for dessert. Texas hots are on the menu too, the sauce sourced from a recipe that's been in the family since the 1950s. There's also a copious slate of breakfast options that includes homemade doughnuts and about a half-dozen specialty omelettes. The interior has been renovated and updated yet retains that classic homey ambience, but the quality of the food and service are merely average (and seem to be declining after the death of the longtime owner, George, a few years ago).",USA
New York,eat,Trini's Tropical,"Serving up delicious Caribbean fare in a small, modest Jefferson Avenue storefront, Trini's clientele draws equally from neighborhood locals and '''Canisius College''''s student body. The menu is on the small side and, for those familiar with island cuisine, doesn't contain any surprises: curry chicken, jerk chicken wings, and oxtail are the best-loved options, but you can also get brown stew chicken, a variety of different ''roti'', and Jamaican patties with beef or chicken. Everything comes with heaping portions of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice on the side, and uniquely among area Caribbean restaurants, you can have the staff adjust the level of spiciness to your personal taste. Trini's ambience is strictly no-frills — food is served in Styrofoam trays and eaten with plastic silverware — but the staff is as friendly as can be, and the sweet strains of classic soca and calypso music complete the picture. They cater, too.",USA
New York,eat,Twisted Pickle,"Located on the inner edge of the Fruit Belt right next to the Medical Corridor, the unmissable Twisted Pickle (look for the neon-green plaster cow sculpture along Michigan Avenue; the effect is like nothing so much as a '''Chick-Fil-A''' advertisement) mostly does takeout and delivery for hospital employees and guests, though there are a few small, not-particularly-comfortable indoor tables. Jammed into an unassuming little building that used to be a doctor's office, the place is so named for the selection of ""specialty pickles"" they serve as appetizers: classic dill, garlic, hot and spicy, and Southern-style deep-fried pickles, all homemade. Other than that, though, the Twisted Pickle's oeuvre is pretty much your standard takeout fare — subs, burgers, wraps, main-course salads, tacos and fajitas, and pizza (whole or by the slice). Try the bacon dog, which is just what it sounds like: a hot dog bun filled with a locally-manufactured '''Sahlen's''' frankfurter and several slices of bacon. The food is passable but no great shakes, but the quick, friendly service and good prices make up for that. And, while you're waiting for your order to come up, you can play at one of the last remaining original '''Pac-Man''' arcade consoles in the Buffalo area.",USA
New York,eat,The Big Easy,"In May 2016, the long wait was finally over for the new occupant of the former Midtown home of '''Buffalo Steak & Seafood''' to be unveiled — and at the helm of the new operation was local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans. Here at The Big Easy, with the help of his fiancée-cum-head chef Lisa, he pays tribute to his newfound culinary obsession, and does so with aplomb: this place may not be able to compare with '''Shango''' or '''Toutant''' when it comes to upscale ambience, but in terms of authenticity it blows both of them out of the water. The Big Easy's menu offers a degree of variety without being overwhelming in length, and the ""deep-fried Southern mainstays"" (to borrow the words of one reviewer) you can order at the counter are dominated by a selection of po' boy sandwiches, which come in 6-inch or foot-long sizes and are filled with generous portions of meat and fixin's: shrimp, fried catfish, and Cajun chicken are the most popular selections, though you can also get a roast beef or hot smoked sausage sandwich. Seasoned fries come on the side in all cases. Elsewhere on the menu is easily Buffalo's most authentic take on the muffuletta sandwich; a distinctly Louisianian take on that Buffalo specialty, the fish fry (Southern-fried catfish takes the place of breaded haddock); and out-of-this-world bread pudding for dessert — but The Big Easy's customers reserve their highest praise for the seafood mac & cheese that's available as a side order (though the portions are so gargantuan it'd probably serve just as well as a main course); a perfectly cooked, creamy and saucy ambrosia with almost as much shrimp and crawfish as pasta. The Big Easy mostly does takeout business, but there's also a small, immaculately clean dining room with a few spartan yet comfy tables and chairs. Service here is enthusiastically helpful and friendly — these folks really go above and beyond in showing customers they appreciate their patronage.",USA
New York,eat,Chef's,"Since 1923, Chef's has been serving hearty Italian cuisine that is comparatively adventurous for neighborhood family-style establishments of its kind. Entrees range from familiar fare such as veal and chicken parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, and spaghetti to more elegant selections such as dandelion salad. Reasonable prices and generous portions. Buffalonians love this place.",USA
New York,eat,DiTondo's,"Buffalo is a place that's well-known for having great Italian food, but DiTondo's never seems to get its due as part of the cream of the crop. Maybe it's their odd hours; maybe it's because of '''Chef's''', its better-known neighbor on Seneca Street, drawing folks in a block before they get here. Whatever it is, lots of locals are missing out, so don't make the same mistake they do. There's a tiny little regular menu with maybe a half-dozen options on it, mostly homestyle, unpretentious red-sauce fare — everyone loves the chicken and spaghetti parm, covered with the thickest shell of melted mozzarella you've ever seen — but the daily specials are the real heart and soul of DiTondo's, which might consist of anything from hot sandwiches, to yummy main-course salads, to pasta in a marinara sauce that lacks the overt sweetness you'll find elsewhere in Buffalo. Whatever you order, expect hefty portions for blue-collar prices — and save room for the homemade custard pies, if they have any left (they're popular!) Best of all, DiTondo's friendly, no-nonsense, super-efficient service is a godsend for first-time visitors who aren't sure what to order. It bears emphasizing that they don't accept credit cards, and Friday is the only day they open for dinner — otherwise it's lunch only, but then again, that's probably when you want to come anyway (popular with Buffalo politicos and other heavy-hitters, lunch at DiTondo's is prime time for local celebrity-spotting!)",USA
New York,eat,Je Ne Sais Quoi,"""Tastes Like Something"" is the (rather odd) motto here, and that ""something"" invariably consists of soul food classics cooked up to downhome perfection — ""as if I were having Sunday evening dinner at Big Momma's House"", in the words of one happy customer. Je Ne Sais Quoi opened in spring 2016 at the former Jefferson Avenue home of '''Mr. Bones' BBQ''' and instantly earned a devoted fanbase. You walk in from the ample parking lot and order from off the blackboard menu hanging on the wall: there's a small core list of permanent options (fried fish, chicken, and shrimp, barbecue ribs, and various combinations thereof) complemented by a revolving door of Southern-fried daily specials. Sides, of which two come with your meal, change daily as well. At Je Ne Sais Quoi the service is friendly as can be and the portions are generous, but prices are a bit higher than similar East Side soul food joints, and they do not accept credit cards.",USA
New York,eat,Oakk Room,"Located in the heart of Midtown, The Oakk Room boasts an environment that's sophisticated yet relaxed, and serves an upscale and Jamaican-influenced take on classic soul food — or, as one reviewer put it, ""comfort food jazzed with exotic spices"". The menu places a definite emphasis on seafood — there's crab cakes, fish and grits, and a beer-battered fish fry on Fridays — and the Caribbean influences come out to shine in options such as jerk chicken and curry fish. The Oakk Room's cocktail list also boasts around two dozen specialty martinis to choose from. Though the range of selections on the menu is small, the food is well-executed for the most part; service is attentive and friendly, and prices are good for what you get. The ambience can best be described as that of a classic old pub, ""lived-in"" yet well-kept and refined, and the clientèle is diverse.",USA
New York,eat,Bailey's Homestyle Cooking,"The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking is an odd but delicious hodgepodge: simple hot-off-the-grill fare like burgers, hot sub sandwiches, hot dogs and French fries rub elbows on the menu with succulent Southern specialties like barbecue ribs and mac & cheese, and they even serve Jamaican-style curry chicken. All this is dished out to you in a homey, unpretentious environment for budget-friendly prices.",USA
New York,eat,East-West Café,"Take the respective halves of this place's name to mean ""Eastern Europe"" and ""Western New York"", and you'll have a pretty accurate idea of the menu here. At East-West Café, you're just as apt to nosh on Polish specialties like ''gołąbki'' (cabbage rolls), tangy ''czernina'' (duck blood soup), and huge, mouth-watering Polish sausage dogs that dwarf the buns they're served on (condiments are around the corner from the cash register) as you are to enjoy local favorites like beef on weck, fried bologna sandwiches or fish fry. Simple sandwich-shop fare like burgers, fries, subs, and melt sandwiches round out the menu, along with breakfast fare in the morning and sides such as chili mac and collard greens that add a soul food element to the mix. Service is quick and friendly.",USA
New York,eat,Jafran Halal Restaurant,"Since January 2015, Mahmuda Chowdhury and Sitara Arshad have been serving up ""Halal Income Halal Food"" (no exaggeration, prices are ''very'' good!) at this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market. South Asian specialties are the rule of thumb at Jafran — an ample selection of ''biryani'', Pakistani-style kebabs and ''kofta'', and tandoori chicken is featured — but you can also get familiar American fare like burgers, chicken and beef hoagies, pizza (plain cheese only), and even fish fry. All the food served at Jafran is ''jabeha'' halal, and on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the restaurant's separate entrance leading directly to Broadway enables it to stay open much later into the evening than the market itself.",USA
New York,eat,Margie's Soul Food,"Though it served what was considered by many a Buffalo gourmand to be the best soul food in town, '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''' closed down in 2016, a victim of its own off-the-beaten-path location in a humble stall deep in the bowels of the '''Broadway Market'''. Flash forward a few months and its successor, Margie's, presents for the aficionado of downhome Southern cooking a scenario that's much the same as before — and, let's hope, a fate much different. Margie Hawkins is the eponymous owner/chef who brings to bear decades of familiarity with the savory ways of the cuisine of the American South that dates back to her childhood days, which she spent cooking for a crowded house of 21 brothers and sisters in her hometown of Selma, Alabama. Now, six days a week at the Market, she cooks up the most authentic takes on fried chicken (a breast and wing cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside), mac & cheese (as sinfully greasy and gooey as anything you'll find in the Deep South), barbecue ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender with a delightful tinge of raspberry in the glaze), and peach cobbler that you can find anywhere in the Niagara Frontier. Yes, just like before, but along with the aforementioned holdovers from McKenzie's menu are more esoteric regional specialties like pigs' trotters and oxtail that are worth a try if you're in a more adventurous mood. If you've ever been down South to a ""meat and three"" joint, the setup will be instantly familiar to you, but at Margie's it's ""meat and two"" — that is, you choose from a meat-based main course and two side dishes, plus cornbread and a biscuit, served to you cafeteria-style in styrofoam takeout containers for a flat price of $8. It doesn't get better than this.",USA
New York,eat,Potts Deli & Grille,"As the signs indicate, Potts Deli serves a combination of Polish and American fare. If you've been to the main location on Rossler Avenue in Cheektowaga, you'll notice that the menu at the Broadway Market satellite is abbreviated and tilts more heavily toward standard American comfort food — but you'll also be pleased to know that the award-winning quality of the huge pierogies remains unscathed (don't be put off by the price; you get what you pay for in terms of both size and quality). If you're in the mood to eat Polish, you can also opt for ''gołąbki'', smoked ''kielbasa'' (no fresh, sadly), or a ""Polish platter"" that combines all three with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes on the side. As for Potts' American selections, you've got a workmanlike slate of standard diner options punctuated by local favorites like fried bologna and '''Wardynski's''' hot dogs. Whatever you order, it's served up with businesslike efficiency in a friendly, folksy environment pleasantly secluded from the rest of the market.",USA
New York,eat,R&L Lounge,"Going strong for over 80 years, R&L Lounge is an honest-to-goodness throwback to old Polonia, courtesy of inimitable owners Ronnie and Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969. Perhaps the best description of dinner at R&L was given by the reviewer who compared it to ""sitting around the kitchen table with relatives"", and grandmotherly barkeep Lottie is nothing if not fully engaged with her customers — the philosophy she expounded on in a May 2010 writeup in the ''Buffalo News'' (""A bartender is like a psychiatrist... a lot of bars don't make it because they're not trained to be people's people; they're only trained to pour drinks"") means that she's liable to come over to your table and talk your ear off, dishing on the latest neighborhood gossip or showing off old family photos. The ambience — original tin ceiling, homey wood-paneled walls where old Genesee Beer ads share space with tacked-up pictures of the Virgin Mary — completes the old-school picture. As for the food, R&L's menu is limited in size but impeccable in quality: Lottie's take on ''gołąbki'' is light as air and delicious, and her handmade pierogi are elegant in their simplicity, standing up well on their own merits without any of the traditional accompaniments like sautéed onions and sour cream. Most popular of all, though, are the Friday fish fries — it's standing room only during Lent as folks from all over Western New York stream back into the old neighborhood to feast on these delicately tasty haddock filets, and R&L stays open well into the evening to accommodate them. Keep in mind that this is a small, family-run operation, so the place sometimes closes without notice and can run out of food on a particularly busy day. It's always best to call ahead.",USA
New York,eat,Lucky's Texas Red Hots,"Lucky's Texas Hots is a neighborhood institution in Kaisertown, serving up ""slime dogs"" and other fresh-off-the-grill goodies seemingly forever at their humble Clinton Street storefront. The local specialty that makes up 75% of the restaurant's name is Lucky's main claim to fame, but its variation of the Texas hot doesn't quite stack up: local consensus says the sauce has a bland, somewhat off-putting flavor. You're better off sticking to the other offerings, which consist of summery fare like grilled chicken sandwiches, sausage dogs, burgers, and Philly-style cheesesteak sandwiches. An upside is that service is friendly and efficient, and breakfast is served all day.",USA
New York,eat,Neapolis Family Restaurant,"They stay ""stick to what you know"", and Neapolis Family Restaurant follows that credo to a tee: leaving the cutting-edge haute cuisine to the other guys, the name of the game here is familiar homestyle diner fare, served with a smile in a spacious dining room that's humble but clean and well-kept — ""the prototypical family restaurant"", in the words of one reviewer. To describe Neapolis as a Buffalo-style Greek diner would be technically true but a bit misleading; the souvlaki, Greek salad, and so forth that's on the menu actually pales in comparison to their classic all-American offerings, such as a range of burgers and melt sandwiches, corned-beef hash, and mind-blowing milkshakes made the old-fashioned way. Breakfast starts early and continues all day, with a workmanlike slate of pancakes, omelettes, and egg-meat-and-toast permutations augmented by delicious homemade pastry. Hearty dinner platters are added to the menu on Friday nights, when they stay open past lunchtime until 8PM. Service at this family-owned stalwart can sometimes be slow, but it's always extremely friendly, with a genuine personal touch — come in a few times and they'll remember your name for years — and the food is ''cheap''. A real hidden gem, this place is.",USA
New York,eat,Doctor Bird's Caribbean Corner,"The satellite location of '''Doctor Bird's Caribbean Rasta-Rant''' presents a somewhat different scenario than at its big sister in University Heights. For one, the selection is quite a bit more narrow — there's a wide range of Jamaican patties on offer, including several choices for vegetarians, but the rest of the menu is made up of two different types of ''rotis'' as well as a few dinner platters; curry chicken or beef, oxtail, and haddock come with sides of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice. On the other hand, the Caribbean Corner also boasts a selection of packaged ingredients for those who'd like to try their own hand at island cookery, including jerk spice and an impressive array of other spice blends. There's also snacks, pop, cigarettes, and other bodega items.",USA
New York,eat,Happy Swallow,"Six days of the week, the Happy Swallow enjoys a placid existence as an neighborhood gin mill that is (in the words of '''Forgotten Buffalo Tours''') ""a rare survivor of the 'family-owned tavern' era"" on the East Side, with longtime owner Tommy Golinowski pouring tall cold ones for a dwindling population of regulars in a homey, wood-paneled interior that's as old-school as it gets. But on Friday evenings only, the kitchen opens up and visitors flock in to enjoy hearty, homestyle Polish dinners at prices that take you back almost as many years as the Happy Swallow itself — this is an experience that was once common in Buffalo but is getting harder and harder to find, so don't miss this place if you can help it. At dinnertime, fish fry is the main attraction, especially during Lent; it comes in either yellow pike or traditional haddock, breaded or battered, and it's ''really good''. Also on the menu is fried shrimp and scallops, plus a grand seafood platter that includes both of those plus a half-serving of fish. Pierogies (with cheese, sauerkraut or potato), roast beef, and other specialties are served too, and all dinners come with heaping sides of fries, coleslaw, American or German potato salad, macaroni salad, and bread and butter.",USA
New York,eat,Ike & BG's Ribs,"Ike's is just a tiny little takeout joint on a desolate stretch of Genesee Street that's only open three days a week, but the Southern-style barbecue fare they dish out is so good that it'd be unthinkable to leave them out of this article. In case you couldn't figure it out from the name of this place, at Ike & BG's the name of the game is ribs — meaty, mouthwatering half- and full racks of pork ribs come slathered with a super-spicy hot barbecue sauce that ""will burn your soul"", in the words of one especially feisty reviewer. There's also dinner specials of fried or barbecued chicken, barbecue fish, steak hoagies, and more. And don't forget the mac and cheese, coleslaw, and other stick-to-your-ribs (no pun intended!) sides.",USA
New York,eat,Lee's Barbeque,"Since 1969, Lee's has been dishing out what many people call the ""best barbecue in Buffalo"" out of a old converted clapboard house in the heart of Humboldt Park. As usual with this type of cuisine, the key is the sauce, and rather than the sticky-sweet, tomato-based Kansas City- and Memphis-style sauces typical to barbecue joints around here, Lee's stands alone in Buffalo with an East Carolina-style sauce: a thin sauce with a vinegar base, spicy and sharp in flavor with no tomato at all. You can get extra sauce with your meal for $1, and be assured: you ''will'' want some. The menu is simple and straightforward, with top billing given to pork ribs and shoulder available either as a sandwich or a dinner platter with coleslaw, potato salad, or French fries on the side. Portions are huge, and though the quality of the meat is somewhat inconsistent, most of the time it's topnotch: meaty, fall-off-the-bone tender, and — most importantly — always saucy. Lee's also serves barbecued half-chicken, chicken fingers and wings, and haddock dinners that are especially popular on Fridays.",USA
New York,eat,Ms. Goodies,"The specialty that put Ms. Goodies on the map is something they call the ""junkyard dog"", which is a hard concept to wrap your head around at first — sort of a cross between a hot dog, a taco, and a fish fry, this odd concoction consists of a fried haddock filet, French fries, and coleslaw slathered with hot sauce and stuffed into a flour tortilla. But it's delicious enough to have won multiple awards at the '''Taste of Buffalo'''. But the junkyard dog is only the beginning of the story at Ms. Goodies. Breakfast and lunch is the time to come to this Bailey Avenue dive; respectively, you can indulge in delicious Southern-style chicken and waffles or a create-your-own-breakfast option with eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, grits and more as building blocks, or avail yourself of hot-off-the-grill hot dogs, burgers and fries. As well, if you're after a soul-food take on Buffalo fish fry, Ms. Goodies stays open for dinner on Friday nights with a menu that also includes fried chicken, mac & cheese, sweet potato pie, and other downhome treats.",USA
New York,eat,Mattie's,"The two big selling points that owners Mattie and Butch Holt use to tout their Fillmore Avenue hole-in-the-wall are ""the best breakfast in Buffalo"" and ""great soul food you'll have to taste to believe"", and true to their word, those are the two things Mattie's does best. In the morning you can get eggs served with your choice of breakfast meat plus grits and home fries on the side, as well as breakfast sandwiches, pancakes and waffles, corned beef hash, and more — all whipped up skillfully and with aplomb. At lunchtime the focus shifts to hearty Southern-fried specialties like mac & cheese, fried catfish, collard greens, and some of the most delectable fried chicken you've ever tasted: the perfect combination of crispy exterior and moist, tender interior. The downside of Mattie's is the other foods on their menu — standard lunchtime fare like burgers, subs and hot dogs are just okay — as well as the prices, which are way higher than the competition. Also, while the neighborhood old-timers that congregate here are as friendly as can be, the same can't be said of the service. Folks have been known to get overcharged here, too, so beware.",USA
New York,eat,ECMC Farmers' Market at Grider,"In the midst of the ""food desert"" of the East Side, where the nearest full-service supermarket is often miles away and the poor often subsist on what they can get from the local corner bodega, fresh fruits and vegetables are, understandably, often hard to come by. From a health-care perspective, that's bad news — and that's why, in 2010, the '''Erie County Medical Center''' launched this neighborhood farmer's market aimed at helping the residents of one of Buffalo's most economically deprived neighborhoods to improve their dietary habits. Much more than just a half-dozen or so vendors of fresh produce, prepared foods, and artisanal goods, the ECMC Farmers' Market is also a place for fun and educational events with an overarching theme of promoting a healthy lifestyle — there's everything from ''tai chi'' demonstrations, to dance and cooking classes, to seed and plant giveaways for those who want to try their hand at gardening. Food trucks are on hand for those who work up an appetite browsing through the greenery.",USA

Single or double rooms are available, with complimentary satellite television and high-speed wireless Internet. The bathrooms are shared, dormitory-style, and a kitchen and common room is available. On-site parking can be had for a nominal fee, but on-street parking is free and nearly always easy to find. The Moreland Guest House enforces a minimum stay of 3 nights, and a maximum of two guests per room.",USA
New York,other,Erie County Medical Center,"The Erie County Medical Center has a history that stretches back to 1902, when the city government founded it under the name '''Buffalo Municipal Hospital''' to treat victims of a smallpox epidemic. It moved from East Ferry Street to its current location ten years later, kicking off a vigorous campaign of expansion under the leadership of Dr. Edward Meyer, and took on its present name after its operations were taken over by Erie County in the 1970s. Today, ECMC is the largest single hospital in Buffalo, with 602 inpatient beds, and is an important teaching facility for '''UB Medical School''', with many faculty members doubling as doctors and other caregivers. ECMC is Western New York's designated treatment center for trauma care and HIV/AIDS treatment, and is also renowned for its specialization in transplantation, burn care, mental health services, and rehabilitation.",USA
New York,other,Sisters of Charity Hospital,"Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity was founded in 1848 by Bishop John Timon: one of many charitable institutions he put in place for the benefit of Buffalo's Catholic community, which at the time consisted mostly of the desperately poor Irish immigrants of the First Ward. The hospital was run at first by a staff of nuns from the Sisters of Charity (hence its name) and moved to its current location in Fillmore-Leroy in 1876. In the present day, Sisters is the flagship facility of '''Catholic Health System of Buffalo''', with 586 beds between its main location and its branch hospital in Cheektowaga. It provides a wide range of medical and surgical care but is particularly well-known as an excellent maternity hospital.",USA

Like its counterpart, Bethel's original home on Vine Alley once served as a station on the Underground Railroad. Since 1953, they've worshiped in the former '''Presbyterian Church of the Covenant''' in Cold Spring, a Gothic-style building erected in 1903. Bethel's pastor, the Rev. Richard Stenhouse, not only leads electrifying services but is also a powerful force in the improvement of the lives of his flock and the community at large — through the church, '''Bethel Head Start''' provides quality preschool education to disadvantaged Buffalo children, '''Bethel Community Development Corporation''' has built several dozen new single-family homes around Cold Spring for struggling families, and there's even a community credit union.",USA
New York,other,Bethesda World Harvest International Church,"An unmistakable beacon in Midtown with its metallic modernist facade and huge animated LED sign flashing onto Main Street, Bethesda World Harvest International Church's history is anything but recent: its roots stretch back to the 1930s, when Elva and Richard White, a husband-and-wife team of traveling revivalist preachers, settled down in Buffalo and founded what was at first known as the Bethesda Revival Center. These days, it's not only a church in its own right where Bishop Michael Badger leads services every Sunday morning, but also the headquarters of the '''Bethesda Fellowship of Churches''', a nationwide network of religious communities specializing in humanitarian and missionary work in Africa.",USA
New York,other,Durham Memorial AME Zion Church,"The dispute facing Bethel AME Church at the turn of the century — whether they should continue meeting in the traditional heart of Buffalo's black community, or move away from what had since become a seedy red-light district — was so controversial that it ended up splitting the congregation in half, giving birth in 1901 to what was first called '''St. Luke's AME Zion Church''' and later renamed in honor of their longtime Pastor, Rev. Henry Durham, after his death. Their current church building, a charming little brick Gothic church in the Ellicott District, was erected in 1920 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places — and it still packs them in every Sunday morning to hear Pastor George Woodruff preach.",USA
New York,other,Emmanuel Temple Seventh-Day Adventist Church,"Emmanuel Temple Seventh Day Adventist Church is a vibrant congregation that welcomes newcomers and visitors with open arms to their beautiful Saturday-morning services with a positive and inspirational message that carries them through their week. They've been doing their thing since 1958 in the former home of '''St. Stephen's Evangelical Church''' in the western reaches of Broadway-Fillmore — a medium-sized, red-brick Gothic building erected in 1911 whose steeple still contains its original Howard clock and three bells cast by the '''Kimberly & Meneelee''' Company of Troy, New York.",USA
New York,other,Elim Christian Fellowship,"The Rev. Dr. T. Anthony Bronner is a Philadelphia native who first cut his teeth in the local faith community as pastor of '''Calvary Baptist Church''' in Humboldt Park. In 1999, he struck out on his own to found this huge, vibrant congregation, expanding to Rochester with its identically-named sister church three years later. Elim is truly a church for the 21st Century — it meets in a huge, warehouse-like building tucked away on a side street in Fillmore-Leroy, engaging a tech-savvy audience with modern-style services live-streamed over the Internet that feature sermons reposted weekly on social media. As well, this is a congregation that truly goes the extra mile in making folks feel welcomed and like a member of the family, whether they're regular attendees or first-timers.",USA
New York,other,Faith Missionary Baptist Church,"The friendly community of Faith Missionary Baptist Church has been led since 1981 by Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister: this pillar of the local community has not only ably stewarded his congregation, expanding and modernizing his church campus, but has also partnered with local not-for-profits and the city and county governments to establish educational, housing, and community service programs to benefit all residents of the East Side. His church on Humboldt Parkway is the site of frequent fellowship meetings, potluck dinners, and other events to engage his flock and others far beyond Sunday mornings. The red neon cross that lights up Humboldt Parkway from the entrance may be unmistakably Christian, but the building that houses Faith Baptist started out as the nucleus of the early-20th Century Hamlin Park Jewish community: this was where '''Temple Beth David''' met until 1955. It's a handsome, beige brick building erected in 1924 in a style that mixes the Neoclassical with the Georgian Revival: the baskethandle arches atop the stained glass windows on the sides testify to the former, while the latter is represented by a huge Palladian stained-glass window above the entrance that still boasts a proud Star of David in white and blue.",USA

New York,other,Friendship Missionary Baptist Church,"Friendship Missionary Baptist Church is a neighborhood institution that's been going strong for over a century: it has been housed in three separate buildings since its establishment in 1913, but true to the neighborhood that nurtured it, all of those buildings have been located on or near Clinton Street in the Ellicott District. Almost as storied as the history of the church itself is the history of the welfare institutions it's sponsored for the local area: from the community grocery store it ran in the Depression years to its status as the first black church in Buffalo to evangelize over the radio airwaves beginning in the 1940s, and right through today with the community educational initiatives, food banks, and other programs maintained by Reverend Edward Jackson. But of course, the Sunday morning services, where longtime members as well as visitors are welcome to a seat at the table, remain the heart and soul of Friendship Baptist — they take place in a brick building dating from 1954 that, like the congregation itself, blends tradition with modernity.",USA
New York,other,Macedonia Baptist Church,"Macedonia Baptist Church's twin emphases are inclusivity and evangelism. Here, visitors and new members are not so much welcomed with open arms as infused with a sensation of suddenly finding one's long-lost family, which dovetails nicely with their goal of spreading the good news of their faith by engaging with the community in myriad different ways, at services as well as with scholarship programs, food drives, and other community betterment efforts. Pastor Herman Alston is the one who carries on the church's long tradition: founded in 1921, it bounced around various locations around the area (including most notably a spell in the 1970s, '80s and '90s at the historic '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''') before landing in the old '''Masten Park Baptist Church''' on East North Street in the Fruit Belt: a simple yet striking English Gothic building erected in 1932 using local limestone.",USA

Pleasant Grove Baptist Church's history can be traced back to 1918, but its present building is relatively newer: erected in 1977 from a design by Wallace Moll, one of the biggest names in the unsung late-20th Century Buffalo architectural community, Pleasant Grove's interior is brightly lit and centered on a modern-style, cross-shaped stained glass window above the altar.",USA
New York,other,St. John Baptist Church,"Affiliated with the American Baptist Convention, St. John's is a congregation whose humble roots — the first service was helmed by Rev. Burnie McCarley in a tiny storefront in Broadway-Fillmore and attended by a congregation that numbered four — belie its modern-day status as a true mover and shaker among Buffalo's African-American faith community. As much a community service organization as a religious community, St. John's 45-acre (18 ha) campus on the west edge of the Fruit Belt comprises not only the church itself — a colorful, brightly-lit, modern structure that's a well-known landmark in the blocks east of downtown — but also '''McCarley Gardens''', a development of 150 affordable townhouses that's about as well-kept and safe as public housing in Buffalo gets, '''St. John Tower''', a nine-story senior citizens' apartment complex, and the '''Rev. Dr. Bennett W. Smith Family Life Center''', a large facility that hosts recreational and educational events open to the community.",USA
New York,other,True Bethel Baptist Church,"Without question, True Bethel Baptist Church is the preeminent African-American religious congregation in Buffalo — and without question, its pastor, the Rev. Darius Pridgen, is the city's most powerful black preacher, serving also as a philanthropist (the church operates numerous charities including a food pantry, thrift shop, emergency housing service, and vocational rehabilitation for the homeless), preservationist (his financial backing was instrumental in the recently-completed restoration of the old '''Michigan Street Baptist Church'''), forceful mouthpiece for the African-American community in Buffalo, and, since 2011, in the city government as president of the Buffalo Common Council. True Bethel is actually three churches in one, with two locations in Buffalo and one in Niagara Falls, but it's the East Ferry Street location that's the biggest — a huge megachurch the size of a Walmart, with an attached '''Subway''' sandwich shop and room for almost five thousand worshippers, the massive scale of this place is a perfect reflection of the outsize stature of its head honcho. The three services held here every Sunday are energetic, empowering, and speak to the contemporary concerns of modern-day African-Americans and Christians in general. And don't worry if you can't make it down for one of them — you can also listen to services live on the radio on '''WUFO''' 1080 AM, or watch them on Time Warner Cable channel 20 or streaming on the Web.",USA

More recently, the church successfully fought off an attempt by the Diocese to merge it with '''Our Lady of Czestochowa''' in Cheektowaga, and this understated English Gothic-style building erected in 1953 remains today the home of a congregation that's on the small side, but vital and welcoming to all.",USA

However, as oratories go, St. Casimir's is an unusually active one: this exquisite Byzantine Revival building in polychromatic terra cotta hosts six Masses a week as well as a full slate of community events and services (including a raucous '''Dyngus Day''' shindig) that preserve its status as the nexus of Kaisertown's Polish community.",USA
New York,other,SS. Columba & Brigid RC Church,"The story of this proud congregation is the story of the historic linchpin churches of two adjacent but very different neighborhoods: '''St. Brigid's''', founded in 1853 as the ""mother church"" of the Irish immigrant community of South Buffalo and located for years on Louisiana Street in the Old First Ward, and '''St. Columba''', which served the Italians of the Ellicott District beginning in 1888 and was famous for years as the site of the '''Printers' Mass''', an extra-late service at 1:30AM on Sunday nights held especially for the newspaper printers whose shifts ended just before that hour. The two churches merged in 1968 after St. Brigid's was destroyed by fire, and today SS. Columba and Brigid is a friendly and welcoming Near East Side church with a congregation that draws heavily from the newly minted Hispanic quarter of the Ellicott District, and which strives to use its ""contagious Christianity"" as a positive force in the lives of all who enter.",USA
New York,other,St. John Kanty RC Church,"St. John Kanty has been anchoring the eastern part of Broadway-Fillmore since 1890, when Bishop Stephen Ryan had had enough of hearing about parishioners of '''St. Stanislaus''' killed on their walk to church while crossing the dangerous '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks that divided the neighborhood. Despite the fact that its building lacks the architectural majesty of many of Polonia's older churches, St. John Kanty counts a congregation that's among the East Side's most vibrant — aside from the half-dozen Masses held here each week, the church remains a powerful force in Buffalo's Polish community through its sponsorship of a bevy of community services for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. It continues to grow, too, accepting the former members of '''St. Adalbert's Basilica''' into the fold when the two churches merged in 2011.",USA
New York,other,St. Katharine Drexel RC Church,"St. Katharine Drexel is a new parish, formed in 2007 from the merger of Lovejoy's three Catholic churches: '''St. Agnes''', '''Visitation''', and '''St. Francis of Assisi'''. The new congregation meets in the former home of the latter church, a newish building in a modernized and simplified interpretation of the English Gothic style that's stood on North Ogden Street since 1959. As well, the new name of the parish is a sort of homage to its former namesake: canonized in 2000, Katharine Drexel is a new-school saint who, in turn-of-the-century Philadelphia, worked tirelessly in the spirit of St. Francis for the benefit of the urban poor and against the racial segregation and prejudice that ruled the day.",USA
New York,other,St. Lawrence RC Church,"St. Lawrence Church is located just inside the city line in Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles. '''St. Gerard''', located at the intersection that gave the neighborhood its name, was their church, but as Delavan-Bailey grew in population it became too small to accommodate all the congregants. Thus St. Lawrence was founded as a mission church in 1914, graduating to the status of full-fledged parish in its own right in 1929. Today it is a small but diverse and friendly congregation that's welcoming to visitors and active in the community.",USA
New York,other,St. Martin de Porres RC Church,"From the 1990s through today, the story of the Catholic churches on the inner East Side was one of shrinking congregations and of churches closing and merging with each other. St. Martin de Porres is one of the East Side's first ""blended churches"" — a merger of '''St. Matthew''' in Genesee-Moselle, '''Our Lady of Lourdes''' in Midtown, '''St. Boniface''' in the Fruit Belt, and '''St. Benedict the Moor''' in Cold Spring — and it's unique among them in that the merger came at the request of the parishes, rather than being imposed on them by the Diocese. When the building they call home today was dedicated by Bishop Henry Mansell in 2000, it was the first new Catholic church in 50 years to be built within the city limits. Another way St. Martin de Porres is unique is as Buffalo's only majority-black Catholic church, and among the ways it tailors its ministry to the worship culture it serves is with a rousing gospel choir headed since the parish's inception by the inimitable Ella Robinson, as well as an '''African-American Catholic Gospel Music Resource and Recording Center''' slated for the Parish Center they plan to build on their Humboldt Park campus.",USA
New York,other,"St. Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr RC Church","The most well-known and vibrant Catholic church on the East Side, this ""Mother Church of Polonia"" has stubbornly retained its status as central hub of the community in Broadway-Fillmore. St. Stan's is best known among locals as a place to celebrate Dyngus Day or trek with your old Polish grandma on Easter, Christmas and other holidays — but it's an equally magnificent experience other times of the year, when it's just you and the neighborhood regulars. For an extra dose of old-school neighborhood authenticity, go to St. Stan's Polish-language service, held at noon every Sunday.",USA
New York,other,St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church,"The seat of the Buffalo Deanery of the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''', St. Nicholas serves a cluster of Ukrainians located in Lovejoy whose history dates back to the early 1880s. It was Reverend Iwan Zaklynskyj who was the church's founding father — in 1905, he and a group that broke away from the congregation of '''SS. Peter & Paul''' on Ideal Street after its ethnic composition shifted began meeting in a small wood-frame structure on Central Avenue. The present building, a Romanesque-style beauty in Broadway-Fillmore designed by prominent East Side architect Wladyslaw Zawadzki, dates to 1919. Today, St. Nicholas — along with the '''Dnipro Center''' on Genesee Street — is one of the twin nuclei of Buffalo's under-the-radar but vibrant Ukrainian-American community: the church plays host not only to weekly services but also fun-filled community events and, on Friday afternoons, to the '''St. Nicholas Friday Kitchen''', where ''varenyky'', ''borscht'', and other lip-smacking Ukrainian specialties are dished out for a song. St. Nicholas is also the sponsor of the ""Good Samaritan"" radio show broadcast Sunday afternoons on '''WJJL 1440 AM''', broadcasting inspirational religious programming in both Ukrainian and English.",USA
New York,other,SS. Peter & Paul Orthodox Church,"Though it was founded in 1884 as a Ukrainian congregation, SS. Peter & Paul became dominated in short order by Russians, who began immigrating to Buffalo in the 1880s and were attracted to Lovejoy due to easily available jobs on the railroads. The departure of the Ukrainians for a separate congregation in 1905 cemented SS. Peter & Paul's status as the first Russian Orthodox church on the Niagara Frontier (these days it's affiliated with the '''Orthodox Church in America'''). The congregation continued to grow throughout the 20th Century and into the 21st, accommodating an influx of refugees from the former Soviet Union, and the richly decorated Russian Byzantine-style building in which it meets today, with its unmistakable onion dome, dates to 1933. Visitors to SS. Peter & Paul today will encounter a congregation that is close-knit yet welcoming to newcomers, with uplifting services held in a mix of English and Old Slavonic.",USA
New York,other,Cleveland Hill United Methodist Church,"A small and close-knit faith community whose ethnic diversity mirrors that of the neighborhood it calls home, this church was founded in 1925 as the '''Cleveland Hill Evangelical United Brethren Church''' and has worshiped in its present building, a simple, modern-style brick and stone church in Kensington-Bailey, since 1949. Today, Pastor Holly Dale-Coty leads a congregation that is active in the community and enthusiastically welcoming of visitors and newcomers.",USA
New York,other,Grace United Church of Christ,"The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''' has been a mainstay in Delavan-Grider for over a century: the congregation still worships in its original brick Carpenter Gothic building erected in 1915. Today, Pastor Larry Jackson leads Sunday services that are friendly and imbued with a positive and uplifting message, and continues the tradition of community engagement that's been one of Grace's trademarks from the start: potluck dinners, lively choir concerts, and other events are frequent and well-attended.",USA
New York,other,Hananiah Lutheran Church,"Affiiliated with the Lutheran Church — Missouri Synod, Hananiah is a new congregation that's led by Reverend Kenyatta Cobb, who doubles as a chaplain for the Buffalo Police Department and the '''Erie County Medical Center'''. Since 2007, they've been based in the former '''A. L. Weber Furniture Store''' on Genesee Street in Humboldt Park, with services whose style blends respect for tradition with innovations that speak to modern Christians. Hananiah Lutheran Church is a small congregation, but it boasts an outsize commitment to community service — their food pantry serves the neighborhood Monday through Thursday — and an ethnically diverse makeup.",USA
New York,other,Hermon Karen Baptist Church,"Affiliated with the Karen Baptist Convention, it was in 2015 when pastor Myo Kyow moved his flock from their former home on the West Side to the erstwhile '''St. James Catholic Church''' in Kensington-Bailey: a hulking English Gothic structure designed by Karl Schmill and built in 1926 for a mixed German and Irish congregation on what was then the outskirts of Buffalo's urbanized area. As before, Hermon Karen Baptist serves as spiritual home to a growing contingent of Buffalo's Burmese immigrant community, whom Pastor Kyow and company actively engage with friendly services, a host of worthwhile events, and group meetings sponsored by a wide range of community groups.",USA
New York,other,Immanuel Lutheran Church,"Immanuel is a pint-sized congregation — over the course of its history, it's never had much more than the two or three dozen members it boasts now — so it's pretty impressive that the church has been able to hang tough in Lovejoy for over 120 years. The congregation was founded in 1894 with services held in German for the first twenty years of its history, and it moved to its current location — the former '''St. Peter's Episcopal Church''' — in 1951. Headed up today by pastor Glen Richardson, Immanuel may be a small church, but the community is friendly and welcoming to visitors. It's affiliated with the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church.",USA
New York,other,Lincoln Memorial United Methodist Church,"Lincoln Memorial UMC is a handsome stone church in the English Gothic style, built in 1921 for the '''Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church''' and situated in a verdant milieu in Hamlin Park. At Lincoln, not only does the congregation bend over backwards to welcome and accommodate newcomers, but Pastor George Nicholas is uncommonly talented at crafting sermons whose messages cut across all types of people and walks of life to touch all hearts. There's even a coffee hour after services.",USA

Reverend Lowell Avery is a true dynamo, leading his church not only in rousing Sunday-morning services but in a full range of community programs and ministries.",USA
New York,other,Metropolitan United Methodist Church,"Much the same as '''St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church''' just on the other side of Humboldt Parkway, the story of Metropolitan UMC is one of five struggling, shrinking inner-city congregations — '''St. Andrew's''', '''Bithynia''', '''Good Shepherd''', '''Masten Community''', and '''Otterbein''' — pooling their resources and merging together to keep the flame of their faith alive in the midst of a changing neighborhood. The building, erected in 1981 on the site of the demolished '''Humboldt Square Evangelical Church''' (later temporary home to predecessor congregation Good Shepherd), is a handsome building in a modernist style; the congregation is small and tight-knit yet friendly and welcoming; the services are helmed weekly by Pastor Angela Stewart.",USA
New York,other,New Covenant United Church of Christ,"Like '''Durham Memorial AME Zion Church''', New Covenant UCC's history can be traced back to the controversy among members of '''Bethel AME Church''' over the undesirable location of their place of worship in what was then Buffalo's red-light district. Desiring to go one step beyond Durham's solution and dispense with Methodism entirely, this church was founded in 1904 and met in a converted house on Potter Street (now Nash Street) donated by one Mr. William Lloyd, hence its original name '''Lloyd's Memorial Congregational Church'''. The congregation moved to its present building in the Ellicott District in 1964 and took on its current name ten years later after merging with '''St. Peter's Evangelical Church'''. New Covenant remains a very active congregation both at Sunday services and in the community at large, with a neighborhood food pantry, an active music ministry, and frequent guest speakers and other events. The congregation is very welcoming to visitors and new members, too.",USA
New York,other,St. Philip's Episcopal Church,"Though you'd never know it from its low-key reputation, St. Philip's is one of the East Side's most historic churches: founded in 1861, it is one of the district's oldest extant congregations, and was the first (and is still the only) majority-black congregation in the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York. They worshiped for years on Goodell Street in the Fruit Belt before their building fell victim to urban renewal in 1974, and their current home is the former '''St. Clement's Episcopal Church''' in Delavan-Grider. Services at St. Philip's blend the traditionally Episcopalian with twists that speak to the African-American identity of its members — for example, there's both a traditional and a gospel choir — and St. Philip's is also the home church of the local chapter of the '''Union of Black Episcopalians'''. There are two services a week led by the dynamic Rev. Gloria Payne-Carter.",USA
New York,other,University United Methodist Church,"With a history that stretches back to 1918, the University Methodist Church has been a linchpin presence at the north end of Kensington-Bailey for far longer than most anything else in the neighborhood. Though services are still held in its original, imposing red-brick Gothic building, the church is now linked together with the nearby '''Cleveland Hill United Methodist Church''' — the two congregations share the same pastor, the Rev. Holly Dale-Coty, as well as the same outsize vitality and spirit of community engagement that belie the small size of the flock, and the same warm welcome for visitors.",USA

Accordingly, Pastor Lou Krutz and his cohorts foster an accepting, low-key, come-as-you-are environment in their services, with a special focus on ministering to youth and young adults: a nursery and Children's Church are available during regular Sunday services, and teens and young adults are catered to during Tuesday and Wednesday night programs, respectively. In order to represent their faith to the community in the best possible way, CityReach goes far beyond simply welcoming new members: they actively and enthusiastically encourage visitors to check out what they're all about.",USA
New York,other,Evangelical Baptist Church,"In the beginning, this was the '''First Russian-Ukrainian Baptist Church''', where a few dozen people met each week to conduct services in the Russian language. As Lovejoy changed and diversified, the church began accepting folks of other ethnicities into the fold and holding services in English; finally, in 1951, the much larger congregation moved into the striking modern building the worship in today. Despite that, the core message has remained the same: the Evangelical Baptist Church is a friendly, fundamentalist Christian congregation that's extraordinarily committed to their faith. Pastor John Carpenter leads weekly services at which all are welcome.",USA
New York,other,First Universal Christian Church,"An interdenominational, full-Gospel Christian congregation that is welcoming and open to all, at the First Universal Christian Church husband-and-wife pastor team Rob and Sue Bradbury preach services with a positive, empowering message, with a contemporary-style delivery that's not bogged down in intimidating pomp and ceremony but is laid-back, accessible, and relevant to modern-day life.

The building dates to seven years after the congregation was established, a sandstone and limestone edifice in a pleasant English Gothic style whose design was unique among all the city's Catholic churches: church, school and rectory were combined in one large cross-shaped structure. Today the church portion is where Sheikh Ibrahim Memon leads one of Buffalo's largest Muslim congregations in Friday prayers, while the school portion of the building is now home to the '''Universal School''', which provides a private Islamic education in the Sunni tradition to elementary- and middle school-aged students.",USA

At the former, ''jum'a'' and other services are held for a congregation composed of about a hundred families, mostly immigrants from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; in the latter, students from pre-kindergarten through grade 10 are educated in a combination of the standard New York State curriculum and rigorous study of the principles of the Sunni Islamic faith.",USA

Cleveland's relationship with Frances would blossom into a romance, culminating in their marriage in 1886, the first and still the only presidential wedding to ever take place at the White House. Folsom Cleveland was immensely popular — the public was struck by her beauty, poise and intelligence, and ladies of the day slavishly copied her fashion sense — and she's still the youngest First Lady in U.S. history. Though the house at 168 Edward Street is not open for tours, the city has placed an interpretive plaque in front of it with details on Folsom Cleveland's life, historical importance, and legacy. Architecture buffs will also take note of this fine example of the mid-19th Century red brick Italianates that remain popular on the Lower West Side.",USA

This bright, airy, and spacious gallery features the work of its owner Doreen Boyer DeBoth, a painter, photographer and jewelrymaker; her husband, noted potter Douglas DeBoth, whose works are available for sale at the gallery; and other local artists working in a diverse variety of media. As well, temporary exhibitions are frequently held whose themes are often related to the rich history and unique identity of Black Rock and Grant-Amherst: Boyer DeBoth is a founding member of the '''Black Rock Historical Society''' and spearheaded the '''Black Rock Historic Photo Project''' whose constituent works can be seen on the exterior walls of several Amherst Street buildings. As well, a modest selection of books on local history and art are available for sale.",USA

Under the careful direction of Anna Kaplan, whose pedigree in the local arts community has included stints as curatorial assistant at the '''Albright-Knox Art Gallery''' and on the faculty of '''Daemen College''''s fine arts department, the BT&C Gallery's focus is not only on hosting exhibitions of minimalist, abstract contemporary art in a diversity of media, but also — contrary to the majority of other Buffalo galleries whose promotional focus is strictly on the local market — to work actively in the marketing of local artists to galleries and collectors outside Western New York.",USA
New York,see,Buffalo Religious Arts Center,"Located at the former '''St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church''' in the heart of historic Black Rock, the mission of the Buffalo Religious Arts Center is to salvage and display some of the works of religious art contained in the many churches and other places of worship (particularly on the East Side) that have closed their doors in the wake of Buffalo's half-century of population loss. In addition to the priceless works from other churches that curator Mary Holland has collected, such as statuary from '''St. Mary of Sorrows''', icons from '''SS. Peter & Paul Russian Orthodox Church''', and various items from '''Temple Beth El''', St. Francis Xavier itself is a magnificent old building full of beautiful and uplifting art which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was a longtime cornerstone of the Black Rock community.",USA
New York,see,Essex Arts Center,"A complex of four buildings that serve as living quarters as well as studio and exhibition space for painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, and all manner of other artists, the Essex Arts Center has been a mainstay on the West Side for four decades running. The center traces its history back to 1969, when local steel sculptor Larry Griffis and his Ashford Hollow Foundation, which was established three years previously to administer the 400-acre (160 ha) sculpture park he'd established in Cattaraugus County, purchased the former '''Webster-Citizens Company Ice House''' to use as an arts studio and performance venue. The Essex Arts Center immediately attracted to its roster a veritable Who's Who of Buffalo's arts scene of the 1970s and '80s, and over the years it has proven to be an incredibly prolific incubator of institutions that have gone on to become major players in the local arts scene — '''Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the '''CEPA Gallery''', and the dearly missed '''Artists' Committee Gallery''' all got their start at 30 Essex before striking out on their own, and '''Big Orbit Gallery''', founded in 1991 and described below, carries on the tradition at its original location. Besides the gallery, the Essex Arts Center also hosts frequent events such as art auctions, musical performances, and educational workshops and seminars whose proceeds go directly to benefit the local arts community.",USA
New York,see,Big Orbit Gallery,"Established in 1991, Big Orbit Gallery is a collective run by and for artists, featuring a changing schedule of experimental exhibitions in a diversity of media. This expansive gallery — situated in a former warehouse whose high ceiling, adjacent interior courtyard, and minimalist decor lend it a cavernous, airy ambience — features diverse exhibitions of works by local artists. Everything from traditional media like painting and photography, to performance art and sound sculpture, to genre-defying, avant-garde spectacle of all kinds can be found here. These works are united by their transcendence of cultures and viewpoints: Big Orbit Gallery prides itself not only on bringing established artists from the Buffalo area to the national and international stage, but also on building awareness of emerging artists of underrepresented demographics. A word of warning: updates to their website are sporadic at best, so Facebook or the pages of ''Artvoice'' are probably better bets for those who want to see what's on at Big Orbit.",USA
New York,see,The Fargo House,"This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill is part private residence, part archaeological dig and part art gallery: award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher bought it in 2009 when it was on the city's demolition list and has been living in and renovating it ever since, a process that has yielded a treasure trove of salvaged structural and decorative elements that he assembles — along with found items from thrift stores, flea markets, and other sources — into imaginative collages displayed in the gallery space on the house's first floor. This ongoing project has earned him praise from the '''New York Foundation for the Arts''' and in the pages of the ''New York Times'', among others. Aside from Maher's own work, the Fargo House also occasionally hosts exhibitions by other artists from the local area.",USA
New York,see,Sugar City,"Sugar City is the loose arts collective that's been best known recently for their impromptu ""guerrilla""-style art shows and performances that have popped up at various spots around town over the two-year interval between their departure from their former home on Wadsworth Street in Allentown and the grand opening of their new one in the Upper West Side. True to their usual nature, most of the renovation work at the new facility was performed by the seven ""Sugar Citizens"" themselves, but it wouldn't be exactly accurate to pin the ""DIY"" label on the collective: its community-based, participatory approach to art would be better described as ""do it together"". The exhibit space in Sugar City's front room is given over to those artists who cannot obtain space in more traditional galleries, with an aim of blurring the lines and redefining what is and is not considered art. There's probably no way to describe the exhibits you'll find here, other than to say these are the misfits of Buffalo's art scene whose creative output defies categorization, so expect the unexpected.",USA
New York,see,The WASH Project,"The humble '''West Side Value Laundromat''' on Massachusetts Avenue is hardly the place you'd expect to be a reliable clearinghouse for information on community cultural happenings, let alone the venue for art studio space, a small library, and a wide gamut of artistic and cultural events. Yet that's exactly what the WASH Project (the acronym stands for ""Westside Art Strategy Happenings"") consists of. Owner Zaw Win, one of the West Side's growing legion of Burmese refugees who boasts a long history of political activism in his home country, teamed up in 2012 with local activist Barrett Gordon and financial benefactors including '''Houghton College''' and the local chapter of '''AmeriCorps''' to turn his laundromat into a beehive of community cultural life where the accent, not surprisingly, is on the diverse patchwork of ethnic groups that have forged a cohesive community on the West Side. At the WASH Project's small gallery, you can peruse monthly changing exhibitions of work by local artists, attend classes and workshops on a wide range of artistic subjects, create your own masterpiece in the ""Creative Spin"" studio (chalk art on the sidewalk outside the building is popular during the warmer months) — and maybe throw in a load of laundry while you're at it. '''''NOTE: The WASH Project has temporarily moved to a new location in Grant-Ferry, where it will remain until fall 2018 while renovations on their original Massachusetts Avenue location are ongoing. Laundry facilities are available across the street at The Laundry Spot. The address and directions given in this listing are for the temporary location.'''''",USA

New York,see,Resurgence Brewery,"With a moniker that pays tribute to the newfound ambition and vigor in Buffalo (and particularly on the emerging stretch of Niagara Street where the brewery is located), the Resurgence Brewery opened in June 2014 in the wake of $1 million in renovations to the former '''Sterling Engine Company''' warehouse that's also home to the offices of '''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''' and the '''BT&C Gallery'''. Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins are Buffalo natives who've put to work their extensive experience in the brewing industry and research of beer culture across North America in the manufacture of premium-quality craft beers in their own hometown. The company's goal for their first year is to produce 3,000 barrels of over a hundred different brews, ranging from standards such as Belgian tripel, saison and India pale ale to locally-themed flavors such as ""Loganberry Wit"" and ""Sponge Candy Stout"". Also in the pipeline is a pilot brewing program, where beer buffs can dream up their own recipes, have a few small batches brewed and sampled by customers, with the potential for those that prove most popular to earn a permanent slot on the menu.",USA
New York,see,Broderick Park,"Broderick Park is a small waterfront green space located at the southern tip of Unity Island. This spot is historically important as one of Western New York's major crossing points into Canada for fugitive slaves travelling the Underground Railroad, as attested to by a prominent historical marker and the occasional historical reenactments that take place there. This was also the site from which the ferry service to Fort Erie, Ontario set off in the days before the '''Peace Bridge'''. Today, Broderick Park is a popular fishing spot where perch, yellow and northern pike, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, and other species native to the Niagara River are reeled in, and is also a haven for picnickers, sunbathers, and bicyclists who pass through the park along the '''Shoreline Trail'''. Amenities include a picnic shelter, as well as a newly constructed amphitheater, gardens, and interpretive exhibits. Broderick Park is also the northern terminus of the '''Bird Island Pier''' (see below).",USA
New York,see,Front Park,"One of Buffalo's many Olmsted parks, Front Park (or ""The Front"", as it was originally named) is situated along '''Porter Avenue''' just south of the '''Peace Bridge''' and contains a soccer field, tennis courts, and picnic facilities, as well as original features such as ""The Hippodrome"", a 3.5-acre (1.5 ha) lawn intended for picnicking or informal team sports, and a terrace concourse for carriages adorned with a handsome statue of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Intended to both showcase and enhance the beauty of the Niagara River and Lake Erie and emphasize its significance to the history and identity of Buffalo, the park once also boasted extensive formal gardens. At the north end of the park stood '''Fort Porter''', built in the mid-1840s as a customshouse and military installation. Some time later, Olmsted was given the green light to extend the Front beyond the canal to the edge of the river itself; though it never materialized, this extension would have included playgrounds, a beach, and a boardwalk. Sadly, together with the West Side's other Olmsted park, '''Riverside Park''', Front Park was badly damaged by the urban renewal that decimated the West Side in the middle 20th Century: the construction of Interstate 190 over the former canal bed robbed the concourse of its serene lake views, and the construction of the new plaza for the Peace Bridge in 1951 culled seven acres (2.5ha) from the size of the park, resulted in the demolition of Fort Porter, and routed noisy trucks bound for Canada through the park (the latter problem will be solved by the controversial expansion of the Peace Bridge plaza slated for the next few years, after which trucks will access the bridge from a new entrance away from the park).",USA
New York,see,LaSalle Park,"Though not an Olmsted park, LaSalle Park is the largest park along Buffalo's waterfront, and its plethora of amenities — baseball diamonds, soccer fields, a swimming pool, a skate park, and a dog run (""The Barkyard"") — have made it popular among locals. This 89-acre (36 ha) expanse was named Centennial Park when it opened to visitors in 1932, Buffalo's 100th year as a city. Later, of course, its name was changed to honor the French explorer René-Robert Cavalier de La Salle, whose ship ''Le Griffon'' passed along the Lake Erie shore in 1679, the first European to see the land now called Buffalo. Architecture buffs will enjoy the Buffalo Water Authority's historic '''Colonel Francis G. Ward Pumping Station''', built between 1909 and 1915 to a design by the local firm of Esenwein & Johnson in a style that's an eclectic hybrid of Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism and the Romanesque Revival.",USA
New York,see,Riverside Park,"Situated on 39 acres (16 ha) in the far northwest corner of the city, Riverside Park features facilities for every outdoor activity imaginable: baseball diamonds, football and soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts, a swimming pool, a playground, and the '''Ruben ""Bud"" Bakewell Ice Rink'''. Riverside Park was the last addition to Buffalo's Olmsted park system — it was not conceived and built until after Frederick Law Olmsted's death, commissioned by the city in 1898 and designed by his two sons. Riverside Park was intended to finally fulfill the elder Olmsted's dream of a true waterfront park for the city and included all the classic Olmsted elements — a meadow, footpaths, wooded thickets, and a carriage concourse — as well as pleasant minnow pools along its northern boundary. It was to have been connected to the rest of the park system by '''Roesch Avenue''', a parkway leading north and west from Delaware Park which was never built. Sadly, Riverside Park is probably the least well-preserved of Buffalo's Olmsted parks today, owing to the construction of Interstate 190 along the canal bed and the removal of many of the historic Olmsted features. However, the scenic overlook still provides a stunning view over the Niagara River (with direct access to the shore provided by the '''Irene K. Gardner Pedestrian Bridge''' over the expressway), and the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy recently unveiled '''River Rock Gardens''' on the former site of the minnow pools, now reinterpreted as a large chain of stone-bedded rain gardens peppered with greenery, traversed by footpaths, and centered on an elegant stone arch bridge.",USA
New York,see,Bird Island Pier,"The Bird Island Pier dates from 1822, when it was built as a buffer between the Erie Canal and the rough waters of the Niagara River, and was once a lively place of fishing shacks, canal boats, and pleasure steamers bound for Canada and Grand Island. Though those are long-gone, the pier recently completed an extensive renovation and structural stabilization and, for the first time in three years, is now completely reopened as a scenic pedestrian walkway. Proceeding southward from '''Broderick Park''' past the '''Peace Bridge''' and onward to a point parallel to '''LaSalle Park''' — 1.3 miles (2 km) in all — walkers can experience an unparalleled view of the Niagara River and Fort Erie to their right, then turn their head and watch rowing crews from Canisius, St. Joe's, and other area high schools set off along the canal from the '''West Side Rowing Club'''. At the end, you're treated to a waterfront panorama that is simply without equal, with the '''Erie Basin Marina''' in the foreground and the downtown skyline and grain elevators off in the distance.",USA

Its centerpiece is the '''Growing Green Urban Farm''', the first one in Buffalo, located on thirteen vacant lots totalling more than an acre (4,000 square meters) in area. Produce is grown in a large greenhouse as well as expansive garden beds, and the farm also features a small orchard of fruit trees, free-range chickens, and a fish hatchery — all kept green by a state-of-the-art, rainwater-fed aquaponics system installed in 2009. Farm work is performed by local youths recruited through the '''Mayor's Summer Youth Program''', educating them with information about healthy food as well as valuable work skills. There's also a farm stand onsite where the fruits of the land are sold.",USA
New York,see,Fontana Boathouse,"The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse has perhaps the most unusual history of any of Buffalo's Wright buildings. Designed in 1905 (contemporaneously with Wright's most famous Buffalo commissions, the lost '''Larkin Administration Building''' and the very-much-alive '''Darwin D. Martin House'''), it was intended to be built for the University of Wisconsin Boat Club in Madison, but was instead built in Buffalo — in 2007, over a century after Wright's design was finalized — and only thanks to the dogged efforts of a local group of Wright aficionados financed largely by Buffalo-born screenwriter Tom Fontana. The only alteration to the original design was the replacement of the stucco on the exterior walls with concrete. The Fontana Boathouse does double duty today as both the working boathouse of the '''West Side Rowing Club''' and a destination for the growing legion of architectural tourists who come to Buffalo to see the works of Wright and other greats. It's also available to rent for private events.",USA

Worthy of special mention is the '''464 Gallery''', whose daylong art fair and sale is a key feature of the festival every year, as well as the annual weiner-eating contest at '''Spar's European Sausages'''. Trolley rides and horse-drawn buggies traverse Amherst Street all afternoon, and live music is performed at various places around the neighborhood.",USA
New York,do,Taste of Diversity,"The Taste of Diversity has been held on Grant Street every summer since 2003 on varying dates, and has become the most popular street festival on the West Side, with almost 2,000 attendees gathering on the block between Lafayette and Auburn Avenues in the heart of the strip. As might be inferred from its title, what's celebrated at the Taste of Diversity are the delicious and vibrant cuisines of each of the West Side's vibrant ethnic communities. But don't mistake this for a clone of downtown's '''Taste of Buffalo''': rather than the area's hoity-toitiest restaurants duking it out for prize money and publicity, the Taste of Diversity takes a decidedly more grassroots approach, where the food is prepared by smaller, more humble (but, it should be emphasized, equally delicious and arguably more authentic) neighborhood restaurants and food trucks, and where the goal is to celebrate the beauty of West Side's diversity — and perhaps more importantly, the fact that a united, cohesive community with an increasingly high quality of life has been forged out of these disparate elements. Festivities at the Taste of Diversity also comprise traditional music, dancing, and other events representing the full spectrum of the West Side's cultural rainbow.",USA

Beginning in late June, festivities are held on both sides of the Niagara River, notably Riverside Park in Buffalo and Mather Arch Park in Fort Erie. On both sides of the border, parades, classic car shows, War of 1812 reenactments (at Old Fort Erie), live music, and fireworks are enjoyed.",USA
New York,do,River Rocktoberfest,"Buffalo has a vibrant multiethnic heritage dating back almost to the time the city was founded, and almost inarguably the most dominant culture was the Germans: in the late 19th Century, they made up more than half of the city's population, and even today, fully 14% of Western New Yorkers claim German ancestry. Why, then, does Buffalo not have a huge German festival to match its '''Italian Festival''', '''St. Patrick's Day Parade''', '''Dyngus Day''', ad nauseam? That was the question posed by the inimitable ""Airborne"" Eddy Dobosiewicz, founder of the festival which was celebrated for the first time in 2013 and aims to take a place alongside those other annual Buffalo traditions. Scaled down quite a bit from the massive, multi-venue blowouts of years past, beginning in 2016 it's the {{marker|type=listing|name=Polish Cadets|lat=42.937838|long=-78.889268}} hall on Grant Street, ironically enough, that plays host to River Rocktoberfest.

Sportsmen's is a venue by musicians and for musicians — its owner is a longtime stalwart in the Buffalo scene, and many local artists and bands cite it as their favorite place to play in the city. The 325 seats are regularly filled with an eclectic mix of hipsters, college students, and neighborhood regulars who probably remember the days when the place was just a garden-variety neighborhood gin mill.

Craft items are handmade by African artisans and include baskets, works of art, and (especially) wooden figurines representing giraffes, tigers, elephants, lions, water buffalo, and other African fauna. Best of all, the money you spend here could scarcely go to a better cause: Kueny uses part of her profits to fund a charitable initiative to promote education for South Sudanese girls.",USA
New York,buy,Julienne Boutique,"Julienne Nyiranjishi's whole family are artisans — both those in Buffalo and back home in Rwanda — and it's their work that's for sale at Julienne's Boutique. Clothing, jewelry and accessories, traditional baskets, and postcards bedecked with beautiful African imagery are on offer, but the specialty here is handmade wooden carvings: from traditional bowls to statuettes to tableware.",USA
New York,buy,Khatiza Gift Shop,"One of the West Side Bazaar's newest vendors, Myanmar native Khatiza Bodialam opened up shop in January 2014 at the stall formerly belonging to the sadly missed '''Anokha Leewu'''. Injecting still more color into an already vibrant environment, the cornerstone of Khatiza Gift Shop's inventory is traditional Burmese dresses in bright, cheery patterns, as well as handmade silk flowers in a multiplicity of varieties. Additionally, scarves, jewelry and other accessories are on offer, as well as a modest selection of fragrances.",USA
New York,buy,Macramé by Nadeen,"Nadeen Yousef, the owner and namesake of this little West Side Bazaar stall, is a native of Iraq who spent six years as a refugee in Syria before the onset of civil war there drove her to Buffalo in 2009. Macramé is rather popular in the Levant; less so in the United States, and back home Yousef had already begun making a name for herself with her skill in the craft, so it was only natural that she would turn to it as a way to make her living in her adopted country. At Macramé by Nadeen she offers a small but charming (and growing!) range of handmade macramé goods including wall art, jewelry, and plant hangers, as well as custom goods made to order.",USA
New York,buy,Moonlady Arts & Crafts,"The rear wall of the West Side Bazaar is given over to Ma Theint's sprawling collection of ethnic clothing, home decor, and (above all) artworks and Burmese handicrafts. Customers can peruse traditional tapestries, Buddhist religious items, drums and musical instruments, tapestries, lacquerware, dolls and puppets, and scads of other items that serve Theint's mission of promoting appreciation of Burmese culture and the immigrant community in Buffalo.",USA
New York,buy,Nepali Clothing & Cosmetics,"As advertised, the wares in Madhavi Pyakurel's new West Side Bazaar stall comprise traditional Nepali clothing, accessories, and cosmetics. ""Fashion has no boundaries"", says the store's motto, and it rings true — customers of all stripes come here to browse through or purchase at reasonable prices an ample gamut of truly elegant dresses and saris, lovely bead jewelry, comfy shoes, makeup and bath products.",USA
New York,buy,African Market,"The African Market opened at the north end of Grant-Ferry in 2009; despite its name, the variety of imported foods offered here spans not only Africa, but the whole world. Though canned goods, spices, rice and other staples, and other miscellaneous groceries are sole here, the marquee item at the African Market is a wide variety of meats, many of which are halal or kosher — from everyday selections like beef and chicken to more unusual ones such as goat. A small selection of kitchenwares and ethnic clothing rounds out the stock. Best of all, unlike most small Grant Street businesses, the African Market boasts off-street parking: there's a small lot on the left side of the building, which is also where the main entrance is found.",USA
New York,buy,Bootleg Bucha,"After a hot minute brweing up their homemade goodness in the basement of '''Horsefeathers Market''', Buffalo's first craft kombucha brewery moved on up in August 2016 to a bigger location on burgeoning Niagara Street, right next door to '''Resurgence Brewery'''. Kombucha is a lightly carbonated, fermented tea (Bootleg Bucha uses a mix of green and black teas) native to East Asia that has a wide array of purported health benefits; the super friendly and enthusiastic owners — Jeff Empric, Heather Lucas, and Todd Salansky, a trio of longtime friends who got their start homebrewing in their apartment and giving it away to family and friends — will be more than happy to run those down with you, or answer any other questions you may have. With the larger location has come a hugely expanded range of selections on offer — there are about four dozen different kombuchas now in the rotation of what's on tap at the store, including the ginger beer, carrot pineapple, and blueberry lavender that were so popular at the old Horsefeathers location. You can buy them in disposable plastic bottles if you like, but Bootleg Bucha will also sell you a more environmentally friendly reusable glass bottle for $2, or you can even bring your own growler to fill.",USA
New York,buy,5 Loaves Farm,"Since 2012, this farm has been run on ten vacant lots on the Upper West Side by Matt Kauffman, as a ministry program of the nearby '''Buffalo Vineyard Church'''. The mission here is to promote sustainable gardening as a way of providing neighborhood residents not only with fresh produce, but also vital education regarding healthy dietary choices. The food grown at 5 Loaves is disseminated mostly to local residents who've signed up for food shares through the '''Community-Supported Agriculture''' program, as well as to local restaurants, schools and food banks — but seasonal produce is also available at their farm stand at the corner of West Delavan and West Avenues, open on Saturdays in season.",USA
New York,buy,Frank Zarcone & Sons,"Like the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', this longstanding butcher shop (opened in 1963 by the now-retired Frank and Maria Zarcone) is a throwback to the West Side's former identity as Buffalo's Italian neighborhood. Though many of the similar businesses that lined the area's streets have fallen by the wayside in the ensuing years, Zarcone's stuck around long enough to benefit from Grant-Ferry's revival as Buffalo's newest hip shopping district, with more and more new customers every day enjoying the fine quality meats available here at decent prices. The specialty at Zarcone's is homemade Italian sausage and meatballs — among the best in the city — but other meats (Italian and otherwise) are available here too, such as Delmonico steaks, stuffed pork chops, and a few seafood items. Limited off-street parking is available.",USA
New York,buy,Golden Burma,"Golden Burma serves the growing community of immigrants and refugees from that country that have settled on Buffalo's West Side with a wide range of Burmese groceries, including fresh seafood, meat and vegetables, as well as canned, packaged, and frozen foods. For fans of Southeast Asian cuisine, the perpetually crowded aisles of Golden Burma are an excellent place to find exotic and unusual products and ingredients that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo. Pots, pans, woks, and miscellaneous kitchenware are also on offer.",USA
New York,buy,Guercio & Sons,"With over 50 years of tradition, Guercio & Sons dates back to 1961. That's when Vincent and Nancy Guercio, immigrants to Buffalo from Cefalù, Sicily, purchased the erstwhile '''Grant Street Market''' and set out converting it into a gargantuan grocery store stocking all manner of meats, cheeses, produce, oils, and other foodstuffs imported from Italy. The business persevered through the demographic changes on the Upper West Side — which saw successive waves of immigrants from wholly different parts of the world pass through the neighborhood — and the rise of the suburban supermarket by expanding into wholesaling, furnishing ingredients for such well-known Buffalo restaurants as '''Left Bank''', '''Hutch's''', and the '''Buffalo Chophouse'''. Now owned by the five Guercio sons, the business is once again thriving — Guercio's is one of Buffalo's prime destinations for Italian foods, both imports and locally produced items such as sliced bread from '''Luigi's Bakery''' and '''Anchor Bar''' brand wing sauce. When they're done marveling at the lovely carts on the sidewalk brimming with delicious, brightly colored fruits, vegetables, and herbs, visitors to Guercio's can enter the building itself and stroll through the fragrant corridors stocked with everything you could ever want from an Italian grocery store — canned goods, imported pasta, sliced-to-order deli meats like mortadella and soppressata, a dizzying array of fine olive oils, and more. Quite simply, this place is not to be missed.",USA
New York,buy,Hatimy Market,"Mirroring the neighborhood in which it's located, diversity is the name of the game at this friendly food market. Hatimy Market's helpful staff, helmed by Somali-born UB nursing student Ali Mohamed, serves nearly all of the West Side's varied communities of immigrants with a maddeningly eclectic variety of groceries from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Arab world. Meats from beef and chicken to lamb and goat, many of them certified halal, are joined on the shelves by seafood, canned goods, rice, spices, and various and sundry food items. Hatimy Market's owners also run '''Shawarma King''', a takeout window a few blocks south where delicious and inexpensive Middle Eastern and African foods are available.",USA
New York,buy,Jomow International Market,"Founded in 2010 under the name '''Marka Halal Market''', this is yet another West Side destination for imported African and Arabian food. A variety of general groceries are stocked, but Jomow International Market's true claim to fame is its wide selection of halal meats, from beef and fish to goat and camel.",USA
New York,buy,Kat Food Market,"Founded in 2014, the name of the game at this ethnic grocery at the north end of the Grant-Ferry strip is African and Middle Eastern specialty foods: from staples like rice and ''fufu'' flour, to frozen foods, to a wide selection of fresh produce, meats and fish. A range of toiletry products and other daily essentials are also on offer.",USA
New York,buy,Lin Asian Market,"Opened in 2010, Lin Asian Market is a pioneer when it comes to serving the culinary needs of the West Side's burgeoning community of Burmese immigrants and refugees. This place's small size and spartan interior belie an impressive variety of Burmese and other Southeast Asian grocery items.",USA
New York,buy,Lorigo's Meating Place,"The cheeky puns are seemingly neverending: Lorigo's ""Meating Place"", so the slogan goes, is ""Your Link to Quality"". Indeed, homemade, family-recipe Italian sausage and meatballs are the specialty at the meat market that Joseph Lorigo founded on the East Side and moved to Grant Street in 1986. Lorigo's began life as a real, old-fashioned butcher shop of the type that are becoming less and less common these days, and the skilled professionals behind the counter still pride themselves in cutting the chicken, pork, veal, and other meats sold here to customers' specifications. However, as time went on, Lorigo's expanded into wholesaling and also converted the store itself into a grocery market that, in a nod to the current melting-pot identity of the neighborhood, sells a wide variety of ethnic foods from Latino (including a full line of Goya products) to Caribbean to Somali to Southeast Asian. The aisles are jumbled and hard to navigate and the place gets crowded at peak hours, but there are some really high-quality products to be found here. Check out their great selection of delicious and reasonably-priced frozen desserts, too.",USA
New York,buy,Produce Market,"At first blush, you'd be forgiven for being a bit confused by the Produce Market. ""Meats, vegetables and groceries"" are advertised proudly on the sign at the front of this Nepali-owned food market, but there's no meat, and the selection of produce is quite underwhelming especially given the name of the place. To be fair, though, the two or three forlorn-looking boxes of veggies just inside the door don't constitute their entire produce section — the real good stuff is in back, with lots of garlic, citrus fruits, and various and sundry Asian produce to choose from. But it's the final element of the trio on the sign where Produce Market really shines. The bulk of their inventory is given over to a respectable variety of South and Southeast Asian packaged groceries and canned goods: huge sacks of rice are stacked in the front windows for passersby to admire, boxes of ''chana dal'' and other dried beans and legumes line the aisles, and spices are sold in bulk for shockingly low prices. A range of cooking oil, Indian pickles and chutneys, and frozen foods round out the selection here. Produce Market is open daily and keeps long hours, and the friendly staff is eager to help folks find what they need.",USA
New York,buy,Rich's Red Brick Market Café,"Located across the street from corporate headquarters on Niagara Street, Rich's Red Brick Market is exactly what the name advertises — a charming 19th-century brick storefront that is the retail outlet for the gargantuan '''Rich Products Corporation'''. The Red Brick Market is one of the only places in the world where Rich's products, which are normally distributed wholesale to restaurants and other institutions, are offered for sale to the public directly — and at sharply discounted prices to boot. The ""café"" portion of this place's name, meanwhile, is indeed a misnomer; the place has only a small retail counter and one table, with much of the interior space given over to massive rows of freezers and coolers. Baked goods are prominent among the offerings in those coolers, with ready-to-bake bread, cookie and pastry dough on offer, as well as a full range of pasta products, meat and seafood items including delicious barbeque pork, and, of course, the famous '''Coffee Rich''' non-dairy creamer that put Rich Products on the map in the first place. Onsite as well is '''Dessert Builders''', which fills custom dessert orders on an advance-notice basis. The Red Brick Market also holds frequent ""Truck Load Sales"" where goods are sold in bulk for discounts even steeper than normal. Visitors who are daunted by the heavy, fast-moving traffic on Niagara Street will be glad to know that ample off-street parking is provided.",USA
New York,buy,Sagarmatha Groceries,"Buffalo's population includes over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan, but for a long time, there was no place in the city for them to buy the foods they had enjoyed in their native lands. That all changed with the opening of Sagarmatha Grocery, whose owner Kaji Sunwar is a Nepalese expat who, with a little help from Buffalo's '''Rich Products Corporation''' and Canisius College's '''Students In Free Enterprise''', cut the ribbon to this friendly little shop in 2012. Here can be found a full range of fresh produce, canned and packaged goods, and spices to serve the palettes of Buffalo's Nepalese and Bhutanese immigrant communities, as well as other aficionados of those cuisines. As well, fresh goat, chicken, fish and beef are sold Wed-Sun, and a small selection of brightly-colored ethnic clothing items is also stocked. Sagarmatha doesn't neglect the rest of the multicultural West Side tapestry, either, stocking groceries and sundry items of interest to the Burmese, African, and Latino contingents as well, including an impressive range of Goya products for the latter.",USA
New York,buy,United Super Bazaar,"Another location of the same operation that runs '''United Grocery and Halal Meats''' on the Lower West Side, this place bills itself as a specialty food shop selling ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, Somalian, African, Spanish, and American food and spices"". That's a bit of an exaggeration, though — the offerings at United Super Bazaar consist of a selection of ethnic packaged foods (largely from South and East Asia) that's really nothing special by Grant Street standards, as well as standard simple American groceries you'd find at any corner bodega and non-edible daily needs such as toothpaste, over-the-counter drugs, and even toys, bedding, clothes and gifts. One strong point this place does boast is a large frozen food section containing some interesting exotic goodies.",USA
New York,buy,City Swagg,"Opened in 2012 at the corner of Hampshire and West Ferry Streets, City Swagg offers the best in urban fashions straight from the streets of New York, L.A. and Miami. From everyday wear like jeans, dresses, and jackets, to shoes and accessories, to swimwear and body suits, the designs here are sexy, sassy and make a bold statement. As well as clothing, City Swagg also sells mobile phones and related accessories, with calling plans from providers such as H2O Wireless, T-Mobile, and Net10.",USA
New York,buy,Empire Kicks,"High-fashion clothing with an urban flair is the stock in trade of Empire Kicks. An authorized retailer of Nike, Akoo, Timberland, Polo, Rocawear, and Reebok, this large store is located in a small plaza just off Grant Street. Empire Kicks is the place to go on the West Side for a wide range of authentic designer t-shirts, hoodies, jeans, and athletic shoes. Sports fans can choose from among the wide array of baseball caps and swag here, with all their favorite team logos on it. Empire Kicks also offers layaway.",USA
New York,buy,Global Chic,"Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below), further expanded her West Side retail empire in 2013 with Global Chic, which complements the gifts, crafts and accessories offered in her original store with a full line of unique, vibrant fashions. Much like her other venture, Global Chic's multiethnic offerings boast a diversity that mirrors the multinational identity of Grant-Ferry itself; however, here the diverse styles are not merely placed side by side on the shelves and racks, but are more often combined within each piece into a delectable multicultural fusion that truly adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Custom alterations are also available.",USA
New York,buy,Global Villages,"Hailing from Rwanda, Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano, cut her teeth as a founding member of the '''West Side Bazaar''' in 2011 before moving up the street the following year to inaugurate her own store, which has been described as a locally-based iteration of '''Ten Thousand Villages'''. At Global Villages, Sano sells a range of unique jewelry, accessories, soaps and bath items, and gifts that's been personally and expertly selected by her. The fashions here represent a diverse range of ethnic styles — from Kenya to Myanmar to India — and the authentic craft items for sale here encompass drums, baskets, objets d'art, decorative items, and more. A small range of literature, primarily on African topics, is also offered. Best of all, Sano prides herself on her extensive familiarity with her suppliers and their work, whether it be a traditional artisan in Thailand, a local crafter on the West Side, or Sano herself, who designs much of the jewelry stocked here. To top it all off, Global Villages' interior is brimming with character — the tin ceilings and original hardwood floors and transom windows are a remarkable preservation of the building's history.",USA
New York,buy,San-Bor Sports,"San-Bor Sports has been described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as an ""urban sports shop that has withstood the tests of time, and for that we are all lucky"". It's true. Owner Rick Bordieri has proven himself nothing if not adaptable, meeting the needs of West Side residents for over forty years even as the profile of the average West Side resident has changed and changed again. At San-Bor Sports a range of sporting goods is indeed sold, but the focus is more on sportswear, with a wide gamut of athletic shoes (including Converse and Air Jordans), baseball caps, custom sports jerseys, jeans, and other casual urban streetwear filling the shelves. In season, a range of bubble jackets, boots, and other cold-weather gear can be had to see customers through the bleak Buffalo winters. San-Bor's selection is impressive: there are some pretty hard-to-find items here, including a full line of t-shirts from '''Stacks and Kicks''', a boutique label headquartered right in Buffalo. The selection is curated by a knowledgeable staff that is thoroughly familiar with the products they sell, and service comes with genuine friendliness and appreciation every time.",USA
New York,buy,Rust Belt Books,"In March 2015, Rust Belt Books emerged from hibernation at a new location on Grant Street after leaving their previous home in Allentown. However, aside from the location little has changed: this is still one of the best, and best-loved, used bookstores in Buffalo or anywhere else. An exhaustive selection of reading material of every genre — from old cookbooks to '70s music journalism to esoteric feminist essays to the classics of literature — is available there for the book lover, with an enthusiastic and helpful staff and colorful clientele. More than that, Rust Belt Books' relentless devotion to the local community sees them playing host to a variety of community events, as well as poetry readings, plays and other special events.",USA
New York,buy,West Side Stories,"West Side Stores is a true gem — a friendly, cozy independent bookstore, well-kept yet unpretentious, that stocks a wide-ranging selection of over 12,000 gently used books ranging from biography to mystery to kids' books to sci-fi to the classics of literature, at prices that never exceed $10. Better still, this place is at the forefront of West Side businesses (no mean feat) when it comes to dedication to their neighborhood — they host community events on a frequent basis, donate free books to various worthy causes, and have a policy of one free book per visit offered to all children who stop in. Though West Side Stories is probably not the place to go if you've got a specific title in mind, its selection is nevertheless fascinating — all the more so given that everything they sell is acquired through donation (they'll pay you a price that's hard to beat for your gently used books!) A children's play area is available for parents who want some time to themselves while strolling the aisles, and the friendly couple that owns the place is always around for a friendly chat with customers, or to put their encyclopedic knowledge of their inventory to use in helping them find what they're looking for. West Side Stories also does a brisk side business selling used records ($3.50 each).",USA
New York,buy,Black Dots,"'''New World Record''' and '''Home of the Hits''' closed in the 2000s and '''Record Theatre''' is down to two struggling locations, but that hasn't dissuaded Black Dots' owner and sole employee, Joshua Smith, a former punk rocker and prolific record collector and trader native to Syracuse, from daring to buck the trend: his place is one of Buffalo's newest independent record stores, whose opening in June 2013 in the basement of a Lafayette Avenue flat was so audacious in the face of steeply declining sales of tangible music that the ''Buffalo News'' devoted a lengthy article to it. The store is named for the groundbreaking 1979 debut by D.C. punkers Bad Brains, and aptly so: Black Dots deals exclusively in new and used punk, hardcore, and indie releases on vinyl and cassette, to the exclusion of CDs, as well as a selection of stickers, patches and band t-shirts. Vinyl aficionados, devotees of underground music, and those who are curious about the local scene will be in heaven at Black Dots perusing the crates of rare releases by little-known bands in the well-worn interior; even the hand-scrawled sign, reminiscent of an old-school concert flyer, screams ""punk rock"".",USA
New York,buy,Sweet Sound Music,"Since 2006, Luis Rodriguez has operated this small Grant Street record shop where the accent is on rap, R&B, reggae, soca, and Latin sounds, as well as racks of streetwear styled to match the hip-hop bent of the music. If you're interested in the local hip-hop scene, look no further: Sweet Sound stocks a wide selection of the latest releases by local rappers at prices that can't be beat.",USA
New York,buy,Community Beer Works,"With a motto of ""Embeer Buffalo"", Community Beer Works is the city's first nanobrewery, proudly producing craft beer that's delicious and award-winning in quality: some of the accolades this place has earned include being named ""Best New Brewery in New York State"" for 2013 by ratebeer.com, as well as a second-place finish for its India Pale Ale in ''Brewing News'' magazine's 2013 National IPA Championships. Indeed, pale ales of various descriptions are the star products at Community Beer Works: its most popular brew, an American Pale Ale called ""Frank"", can be found on tap at well-known local spots like '''Allen Street Hardware''', '''Pano's''', and the '''Village Beer Merchant'''. They also have a retail store open three days a week where beer aficionados can come and fill their bottles and kegs — 32-ounce (946 ml) growlers for $7, 64-ounce (1,893 ml) growlers for $12, and kegs for $90 — or buy branded merchandise such as T-shirts, glasses and growlers. Best of all, Community Beer Works' commitment to the well-being of the Buffalo area is legendary: spent grain from the brewery is donated to the '''Massachusetts Avenue Project''' to be reused as fertilizer, and community pride and a sense of place are fostered in many other ways as well.",USA
New York,buy,Frontier Discount Liquors,"Frontier Liquors opened in 1974, long before Grant Street had the cachet it does today — and as the neighborhood has continued its upswing, this place has really grown into its reputation as the place to go for a far-ranging selection of potent potables, including some hard-to-find wines and spirits that other Buffalo liquor stores don't carry. Frontier is no less impressive in the beer department, with all the usual brands in stock plus a nice range of craft brews from Upstate New York and elsewhere in the region. Ice and salty snacks are also sold to complement the alcohol. Delivery service is available, and, uniquely among liquor stores in the area, Frontier even offers event planning for those who may be planning a party or get-together. Unfortunately, the ""discount"" portion of this place's name is a bit of a misnomer, but fear not — frequent special deals and promotions are offered.",USA
New York,buy,Between Yesterday & Tomorrow,"This friendly neighborhood variety store proudly offers ""a little bit of everything... not a lot of anything"". That little bit of everything will be of particular interest to fans of kitsch; though there's a lot of junk here, buried within it are some great finds: quirky clothing, accessories, toys, gifts, and miscellaneous ephemera. Best of all, Between Yesterday & Tomorrow offers the kind of old-fashioned personal service with a smile that you can't get at Walmart or other big-box retailers.",USA
New York,buy,The Morning Star,"Opened in January 2013 in the Hampshire Street storefront formerly occupied by the beloved '''Burma Family Store''', Morning Star sells a little bit of everything. ""100% African"" is the motto that ties together the motley range of merchandise on offer here — from beauty supplies to groceries to a selection of secondhand clothes, DVDs, decorative items and other gifts.",USA
New York,buy,Sunday Skate Shop,"Newly moved to Grant Street from its longtime former home in the Elmwood Village, Sunday is the epicenter of Buffalo's tight-knit skateboard community. Founder J.P. Gillespie heads up a friendly staff that is passionate about their love of skating, providing helpful service to longtime customers and welcoming into the fold those who may be new to the sport. In addition to the first-rate selection of boards on offer there, a selection of clothing and gear is available at Sunday: sneakers (including the latest from such popular brands as Nike, Emerica, and Vans), socks, caps, T-shirts, hoodies, and skating videos. Speaking of which, Sunday is also known for the skate videos it produces and screens locally, featuring such illustrious Buffalo talent as Sal Viglietta, Tony Huffnagle, and Jake Donnelly.",USA
New York,buy,The Jump-Off,"In March 2012, longtime Amherst Street resident Demetrius Williams opened The Jump-Off with a view not only to furthering the growth of Grant-Amherst as a small-business shopping destination, but also of its cultural life: his plans are to eventually hold open-mic events in store for local performers. For now, though, available at The Jump-Off is a respectable range of men's and women's clothing and accessories, united by a stylish yet streetwise urban aesthetic.",USA
New York,buy,Mr. Millennium,"Situated on the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road at the former site of the '''Adriatic Gardens''' restaurant, some of the crowded shelves and racks of this Yemeni-owned outlet are devoted to a respectable selection of colorful and glitzy ladies' fashions, including cute tops, formalwear, jewelry and accessories, and shoes. But above all, Mr. Millennium is best known for the wide range of menswear they carry. From designer jeans and t-shirts, to mens' jewelry and watches, to baseball caps (this place is a licensed dealer of '''New Era''' caps), to bubble jackets and hoodies, Mr. Millennium is the place for you if you're looking for urban-styled clothing of pretty much any permutation. The other half of the business is prepaid mobile phones, with phones and plans on offer from '''Boost Mobile''', '''Virgin Wireless''', and others. The sometimes rude customer service is a sticking point for visitors to Mr. Millennium, but the selection here is the best in the neighborhood, and they're open late.",USA
New York,buy,Shirtz,"The name of the game at this aptly named Amherst Street store is one-of-a-kind customized T-shirts designed in-house. These guys do first-rate work and infuse their designs with the urban flair that has come to characterize the small but growing fashion scene in Grant-Amherst. The bulk of Shirtz' inventory is made up of creative graphic tees, including some with airbrush designs. A range of band tees, other designer clothes, and embroidery rounds out the selection here. Shirtz' staff has their ear to the ground when it comes to the local scene — they're active and highly sought-out in the production of music videos, commercials, and promotional videos for Buffalo-based businesses and artists — so if you're looking for something unique and characteristically Buffalo, you'd be well-advised to head here.",USA
New York,buy,Chotchky's Antiques and Collectibles,"Kathleen Arries is to be commended for truth in advertising: there are plenty of tchotchkes to be found in the ample Amherst Street storefront her business occupies. The 6,500 square feet (600m²) of retail space here are crammed to the gills with antiques of all descriptions: rare, original and unique examples of housewares, toys, clocks, baskets, and every miscellaneous trinket you could imagine that are the end result of over 100 years of family collecting. This is the kind of place you'd see on ""American Pickers"". Despite the vast variety of stuff to be found here, Chotchky's is at heart a small family business and a labor of love — Arries has been the sole employee of this shop since it opened in 1998. This place does a brisk mail-order business as well.",USA
New York,buy,Coo Coo U,"Coo Coo U's owner, Michael Mensola, has a habit of being a pioneer in every new neighborhood in which he sets up shop — the business moved in 2012 to the former '''Jewett Refrigerator Warehouse''' off Military Road after spending the previous quarter-century on Hertel Avenue, and was located in Allentown before that. Coo Coo U is the alpha and omega in Buffalo when it comes to Mid-Century and Scandinavian Modern, whether it be furniture, decorative items, works of art, or all manner of other retro curiosities. Aficionados agree that the selection and quality of the items that fill this cavernous space is among the best anywhere, even holding its own with the best that places like Toronto and New York City have to offer. To be found here are a myriad of one-of-a-kind items with a fanciful postwar aesthetic — chairs, sofas, coffee tables, lamps and the like are joined by modernist paintings and sculptures, as well as musical instruments, jewelry, and elements of industrial and architectural design. You could easily spend a whole day here. Hours of operation are variable — don't be surprised if the owner opens the place up early or stays late, especially during special sales and promotions or around the holidays.",USA
New York,buy,Junk & Disorderly,"Summer 2015 saw another addition to Grant-Amherst's roster of antique and vintage stores arrive at the former home of '''Puchalski's Florist''' — which, like its new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski, are longtime neighborhood fixtures. These two have been steadily growing their own collection of antiques and vintage collectibles for north of 30 years, and with Junk & Disorderly their bounty is now available to the buying public. And what a bounty it is — there's a ton of merchandise crammed into this little place, all as kitschy as the name implies. Going beyond the kitsch factor, it's rather difficult to generalize about the constantly changing lineup of merchandise that passes through Junk & Disorderly's doors, but midcentury vintage knickknacks seem to handily outnumber outright antiques (the cutoff date seems to be around World War II) and specialties seem to include lamps, kitchenware, and above all, a treasure trove of decorative Christmas baubles, vintage ornaments, and other holiday-themed items. But the inventory is a diverse hodgepodge — the owners are known to train their eyes on anything unusual or offbeat, and to travel long distances to do so, with merchandise sourced from estate sales, swap meets, and flea markets across the Northeast. Junk & Disorderly's opening hours aren't what you would call extensive, but if you can't make it to Grant Street on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon but happen to be heading eastward after your visit to Buffalo, you might catch the owners at their table at the Ontario Antique Mall in Canandaigua.",USA
New York,buy,Amherst Street Wine and Liquor,"Amherst Street Wine and Liquor is located across the parking lot from '''Wegmans''' supermarket and is owned by the same family — and though eyebrows were raised upon its December 2014 opening, which was seen by some as an end-run around the New York state law that prohibits supermarkets from selling liquor, Wegmans' legions of admirers will probably be pleased with the similarities between the two businesses: aisles and shelves organized more like a supermarket than a typical liquor store, a selection whose size and variety befits a big-box warehouse retailer, and customer service that is second to none in friendliness, helpfulness and knowledge of their product. Your Wegmans Shoppers Club Card is even good there. If you're here for wine, you'll find lots of imported vintages as well as domestics from California and the Finger Lakes, but sadly, if you're after a local wine (say, from Niagara County or the Lake Erie Wine Trail), you'll likely leave disappointed. Prices are generally average compared to other liquor stores — the mom-and-pops don't have to worry just yet — but there's always a selection of $6 wines for those on a budget as well as a locked room of rare and high-end wines if you're in the mood to really splurge. Wine tastings are also held on a frequent basis. As for liquors, the bases are covered with all the usual products as well as occasional surprises such as ''metaxa'' (Greek brandy) and other harder-to-find items, again at average prices.",USA
New York,buy,Gambino Liquors,"Since 1995, Michael Gambino has helmed this family-owned and operated liquor store where first-rate value for money is married to the professional, courteous service of the highest order they provide to their loyal customers. Gambino Liquors styles itself as ""Your One-Stop Liquor Shop"", and that's no exaggeration — it stocks one of Buffalo's widest selections of beer, wine, and (especially) spirits of every description imaginable, as well as mixers, snack foods, and various and sundry other goodies. But what Gambino is perhaps best-known for is their affordable prices — nowhere in the area can you get products of such a high quality for more affordable prices. Delivery is available, too.",USA
New York,buy,Habitat for Humanity ReStore,"Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization dedicated to helping low-income individuals and families find housing, operates two locations of ReStore in Buffalo. The original one is located on Amherst Street. What ReStore amounts to is basically a huge thrift store for furniture and housewares: the shelves are stocked with gently used (and some new!) chairs and tables, sofas, bedroom sets, lamps, cabinetry, doors and windows, building materials, and appliances donated to them by the public. Best of all, this place operates with very little overhead — it's staffed by volunteers, so almost all the money you pay goes to help Habitat for Humanity build new homes and rehab old ones to help out the less fortunate. Prices at ReStore are great, but to sweeten the pot a little, they run sales and promotions occasionally, and offer 10% discounts to college students. If you want to give back, donations are accepted at the store during business hours, or you can schedule a pickup.",USA
New York,buy,Spar's European Sausage Shop,"Spar's European Sausage Shop was founded in 1989 by Eric Spar, a native of Augsburg, Germany, and purchased by its current owner, Spar's former apprentice Joe Kennedy, in 2005. This place was recognized as selling the ""Best Sausage in Buffalo"" five years in a row by ''Artvoice'' in their annual ""Best of Buffalo"" poll, and it's not hard to see why: this place deals in what is easily the city's widest variety of sausages, both fresh and smoked, handcrafted on the premises using only the freshest and finest ingredients. Not surprisingly, German selections such as bratwurst, knockwurst and weisswurst are predominant, but this place sells literally every kind of sausage you can imagine: Swedish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Polish and Italian sausages, chorizo, andouille, ''merguez'', double-smoked ''kabanosy'', and on and on. And if Spar's doesn't carry your favorite type of sausage, they'll custom-prepare it for you. Though the sausages are obviously the star of the show, Spar's sells a variety of steaks and chops, cheeses, deli meats including homemade bologna, and specialty groceries that split the difference between imported items and local favorites such as '''Broadway Market''' horseradish, '''Scharf's Schiller Park''' German salad dressing, '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard, and '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas.",USA
New York,buy,Yasin African Market,"Much like its counterparts on the other end of Grant Street, Yasin African Market is a destination for those in search of ethnic groceries and halal meats such as fish, lamb, goat and chicken. However, Yasin African Market does its competition one better by offering an interesting selection of other goods such as handbags and purses, as well as gifts including some surprisingly high-quality carpets.",USA
New York,buy,Fundalinski Studio,"Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski were in business on Amherst Street long before it became a happening strip on the newly hip West Side: they opened up their eponymous Fundalinski Studio in 1982. Both the owners are certified members of the '''Professional Photographers of America''', and Bogdan is also a multiple-time Kodak Gallery Award winner. Fundalinski Studio mostly handles portrait photography, but a brisk secondary business here is selling archival-quality prints of the artists' original work — both Janice's placid nature scenes and Bogdan's colorful, whimsical fantasy images.",USA
New York,buy,S & M Market,"S & M Market looks like just another corner bodega of the type that's so common on the West Side, but a peek inside is sure to surprise the unsuspecting visitor. S & M began life in 2009 as a friendly, all-purpose bedding and linen store; indeed, the bread and butter of the inventory here is still a full slate of sheets, comforters, and a wide variety of original blankets (including Disney designs) to fit all bed sizes, as well as mattresses and pillowtops for unbeatable prices. Towels, curtains, rugs, and carpets are on offer as well. However, newly armed with a food store license, S & M expanded its oeuvre in 2012, and now boasts an intriguing mishmash of wares including high-quality hookah pipes, a variety of halal meats, body oils and perfumes, and more.",USA
New York,buy,The Serendipity Shoppe,"The Serendipity Shoppe is back — after being displaced two years previously by construction at its previous home, Elmwood Avenue's '''Lafayette Presbyterian Church''', Buffalo's favorite high-end secondhand store reopened in summer 2014 on burgeoning Amherst Street. The location has changed, but the goods on the shelves remain the same: this place specializes in fine-quality, previously-owned jewelry, artwork, books, furniture, home decor, collectibles, and more (but, interestingly, ''not'' clothing). There's some really unique and offbeat finds here, the kind of stuff you don't generally see at thrift shops, and fans of quirky vintage styles are in luck. Best of all, your money goes to a good cause: the Serendipity Shoppe is run on a not-for-profit basis, with all proceeds benefiting the '''Buffalo AIDS Plus Fund''', which helps residents of the eight-county Western New York area living with HIV and AIDS. Tax-deductible donations are accepted; see website for details.",USA
New York,buy,Kings of da West,"The central node of a trio of related shops on the corner of Niagara and Hudson Streets, Kings of da West sells West Siders a variety of new and secondhand urban clothing, shoes, jewelry, and fashion accessories as well as a small variety of cigarettes and smoking supplies. Ladies aren't left out in the cold either: '''Queens of da West''' extends the business into the storefront next door, with ladieswear, purses and other accessories, wigs, and fragrance on offer in similar styles. Lastly, '''Kings Wireless''' is a destination for cell phones and accessories as well as electronics repair.",USA
New York,buy,Positive Approach Press,"Newly moved to Connecticut Street from its former home in Allentown, Positive Approach Press works with customers to create custom-designed screen-printed t-shirts, sweatshirts, and even jackets and pants, handcrafted in-house by some of the best designers Western New York has to offer. The folks at Positive Approach offer great rates and even better turnaround times (less than seven days in most cases) and will also custom-design business cards, posters, wedding invitations, stationery, and other paper goods.",USA
New York,buy,RudeBoyz Artworks,"After a successful run in the downtown Theater District during the 2015 holiday season as a '''Queen City Pop-Up''' shop, RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard, moved their line of handmade clothing, accessories and custom artwork to the newly renovated '''Club Utica''' building in the heart of Five Points. As newcomers to Buffalo (they originally hail from Shreveport, Louisiana), the Ballards were conscious from the start that networking with others in the local arts community would make or break their business, and on the shelves at RudeBoyz you can find a wide variety of jewelry, decorative baubles, and others goods produced in limited quantities by local artisans. The dominant presence, though, is Qean's: a street artist by trade, you can find his signature aesthetic — graffiti-inspired designs tempered by superhero and Japanese anime motifs, as well as other influences — all over the place, but especially in the custom artwork he creates in the studio in the store's back room. You can even bring in your own clothing and commission him to airbrush or screen-print custom designs on them. RudeBoyz also serves as a nexus for Buffalo artists with the temporary exhibitions that often grace the store's walls, as well as the music concerts and community functions held there.",USA
New York,buy,Á Châu International Market,"Authentic and gritty with no hint of the supermarket gloss of '''Wegmans''' (or even '''Tops''' on Niagara Street), Á Châu International Market's crowded aisles are stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of Indian, African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Included in the inventory are delicious and unusual meats, fresh fish, a blockbuster selection of Asian produce such as durian, bok choy, and flaming hot Thai chilies, tea and energy drinks, frozen foods, and in the words of one reviewer, ""every kind of spice, edible sea critter, and sauce you could ever ask for"". If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, this is not a bad place to stop into. Á Châu's helpful employees — who double as the owners of '''Niagara Seafood''', the Vietnamese restaurant next door — are happy to assist customers in navigating the disorganized clutter. They even sell chopsticks, woks, and other housewares. A word of warning, however: the ""authentic Asian grocery"" part of this blurb is not to be taken lightly, meaning that the squeamish may need to avert their gaze from sights like whole frozen bullfrogs in the freezer cases, buckets of freshly eviscerated organ meats, and whole ducks, chickens and rabbits strung up as window displays. There's also a smaller satellite location on the East Side.",USA
New York,buy,Arbin Grocery & Halal Meats,"Situated on bustling Connecticut Street a stone's throw from '''Masjid al-Eiman''', Arbin Halal Meat is a new food store that stocks a modest but intriguing selection of halal meat, fresh produce, and dry groceries geared toward Buffalo's growing Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indian population. In addition to what's already been mentioned, Arbin also stocks large sacks of ''channa daal'' and other grains, Indian spices, a small range of Islamic clothing, as well as Western-style snack foods and a surprisingly ample selection of household goods. At Arbin the aisles are cramped and the shelves are not particularly well organized, but the small size of the store means that if they carry it, you'll probably find it before too long.",USA
New York,buy,Barrel + Brine,"The hipster-fication of the West Side logged another benchmark in December 2015 with the opening of this specialty shop dedicated to all things pickled and fermented, situated in the heart of the historic West Village a literal stone's throw away from '''Johnson Park'''. Owner R.J. Marvin is a self-styled ""Willy Wonka of pickles"", a 17-year veteran of the local restaurant industry who, while working at the '''Elm Street Bakery''' in East Aurora, hit on the idea of a store that sold unusual varieties of pickles, made in-house from local produce. Flash forward to opening weekend, when he and his wife/partner Lindsey had to abruptly close up shop the day after their grand opening after completely selling out of all their stock; the lines had been out the door all day long. Barrel + Brine's selections change frequently — on a given day you'll find creative twists on everyday favorites such as sauerkraut (""classic recipe"" as well as homemade kimchee and red beet and caraway kraut) and pickled cucumbers (both full sours and bread-and-butter varieties; popular favorites include the ""Million Dollar Pickle"" based on an old Amish recipe, the self-explanatory ""Bloody Mary Pickle"", and a ""Southern Tier IPA Pickle"" with fresh hops added to the spice blend), as well as more exotic finds such as fennel-pickled beets, Chinese-style pickled peanuts, ''kkakdugi'' (Korean-style spicy pickled radishes), pickled watermelon rind, and pickled sausage sourced from '''Spar's''' on Amherst Street.",USA
New York,buy,Buffalo Grocery & Halal Meats,"Buffalo Grocery & Halal Meats is owned by the same people who run '''United Super Bazaar''' on West Ferry Street, and the selection of items is much the same as well — ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, African, Spanish, [and] American food and spices"" are proudly touted on the exterior sign. Like its newer counterpart, though, in reality the selection here isn't as impressive as all that, and skews far more heavily in favor of the Subcontinental and Southeast Asian sides of the equation than the Arabian, African or Latino.",USA
New York,buy,Chez La Camer & Rock Centero Market,"Along with a range of hair and beauty supplies, braiding, cosmetics, and ethnic clothing, African food is the specialty at this newly established market at the north end of the Niagara Street strip. A modest variety of both fresh and frozen groceries are available for aficionados of the cuisines of West and Central Africa. Also, for anglers who are keen on trying their luck at nearby '''Broderick Park''' or elsewhere along the West Side riverfront, live bait is offered for sale.",USA
New York,buy,The Chocolate Shop,"Established in 1950 by West Side native Frank Caruana, The Chocolate Shop is a longstanding neighborhood mainstay that has delighted thousands of Buffalonians over the years. Caruana learned from the best, cutting his teeth at the legendary '''Merkens Chocolate Company''' on Jersey Street before striking out on his own, hand-dipping and hand-molding the confections at first before the sheer volume of his shop's popularity forced him to invest in automated machinery. Years later, The Chocolate Shop is still in business custom-molding chocolates to its customers' specifications, whether it be reproducing a sample item or bringing their zaniest fantasies to life in chocolate form. The bulk of the Chocolate Shop's business is corporate orders and fundraisers, but at their Niagara Street retail location can be found a range of chocolates and candies (including sponge candy, Buffalo's favorite chocolate treat) as well as personalized gift packs made fresh daily with only the finest ingredients.",USA
New York,buy,Five Points Bakery and Café,"In the words of their website, Five Points Bakery is all about ""raising the bar on local food"" and ""striv[ing] to overcome the limitations of our food system and reclaim our food heritage through education... and a dedication to sustainability"". Sound a bit high-concept and expensive? It is, but visitors who persevere past their initial reaction to Five Points' prices soon see that what's sold there is worth splurging for. After a brief hiatus, this heaven for foodies is now reopened in a new location around the corner from the original — a spectacularly restored turn-of-the-century brick block with greatly expanded seating at tables and along the bar. As well, in summer there's additional seating on a rear patio that's one of the most pleasant and distinctive in town: rustic furniture and adobe-colored stucco applied to the walls and foundation of a former outbuilding give it a distinctly Southwestern feel. There's Ethernet ports for laptop jockeys, and both dining room and patio have kids' play areas that are fully stocked with toys, games and books. But the core of the business remains the same: homemade artisanal multigrain, whole-wheat and ciabatta breads made with organically-grown grain from right here in Western New York (specifically, the Zittle Farm in Hamburg), along with delectable pastry — their huge cinnamon rolls are a favorite. Folks especially like the toast bar, where you can choose from various breads to pop in the toaster and top with your choice of honey, peanut butter, and various fruit compotes and cheese spreads. As always, vegans and those with special dietary needs will be delighted that all ingredients are scrupulously labelled.",USA
New York,buy,Less Price,"The sign on the outside of this bodega, located on the corner of Massachusetts and Plymouth Avenues where '''Mama's Kitchen''' used to be, proudly advertises ""fresh produce, halal meats, and variety groceries"". Sadly, that's an exaggeration (as is the place's name). At Less Price there's no meat at all and only a small freezer full of frozen vegetables, with the inventory mostly given over to general groceries, kitchenwares, toiletries, and snack foods and other corner-store fare. However, they do offer a small selection of Indian and South Asian spices, dried chilies, cooking oil, and ethnic snack foods that might do in a pinch if you've got a hankering for Indian food but are missing a few ingredients.",USA
New York,buy,Mike's Tropical Market,"Mike's Tropical Market is a popular gathering place for the West Side's burgeoning Latino community, a crowded little corner store jam-packed with specialty groceries including a huge range of Goya products. This is probably the best place in the city for those in search of ingredients for delicious Puerto Rican and Dominican recipes who want a more distinctive experience than what's offered at a supermarket. One-upping other bodegas in the area, Mike's also boasts a sizable frozen-foods section, a small selection of quality butcher meats and deli items, and fresh tropical (and other) produce. Best of all, Mike's carries a great selection of specialty coffees at prices that can't be beat.",USA
New York,buy,Mineo & Sapio Italian Sausage,"Mineo & Sapio is arguably Buffalo's favorite locally-produced brand of sausage — and almost inarguably its best-loved Italian sausage. The business has built a sterling reputation from its humble beginnings in 1920, founded by John Mineo as a neighborhood meat market on the main drag of the Italian West Side, to a ubiquitous presence in the meat coolers of Western New York supermarkets and on the tables of some of the city's finest restaurants. In addition to their most famous product (which comes in both links and patties, sweet or spicy), Mineo & Sapio also manufactures chicken sausage, andouille sausage and chorizo, delicious Italian meatballs, meatloaf, and, most recently, several varieties of stuffed hot peppers. Uniting all these products is an unrelenting emphasis on quality — their classic-recipe Italian sausage uses 100% pork with no preservatives or artificial colors, the chicken is a boneless and skinless mix of white and dark meat, and the sausages are packed in all-natural hog casings. Best of all, despite the growth of the business, Mineo & Sapio's Connecticut Street retail store retains a friendly, intimate atmosphere — impregnated with the delicious aroma of sausage spices, to boot. Frozen sausage of the same type that's sold in grocery stores can be bought there, but since you have the opportunity, you really want to go for the fresh stuff.",USA
New York,buy,Nature's Apothecary,"'''Horsefeathers Market''' is the home to the newest entry in Buffalo's growing roster of vegan restaurants and food shops: Nature's Apothecary is where Elena Capozzi, a young entrepreneur and recent graduate of the '''Institute for Integrated Nutrition''', shares her knowledge of and enthusiasm for healthy, holistic eating — not to mention her wonderfully prepared recipes — for hungry folks from across Western New York. The stock in trade here is a mix of yummy baked goods (so delicious that more than one reviewer outright refused to believe they were as healthy as claimed!) as well as raw salads, cold-pressed juices and smoothies, and other prepared foods, all of which are made from organic, sustainably sourced ingredients with no meat, dairy, or corn syrup, and prepared so as to retain as many of the original vitamins and nutrients as possible from the source foods. All items sold at Nature's Apothecary are meticulously labeled with not only a list of ingredients, but a brief description of how each one is beneficial to the body. While most business is to go, there's also limited indoor seating.",USA
New York,buy,Niagara Asian Market,"It's not the largest Asian food store on the West Side, but the Niagara Asian Market is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside — and far better-organized than most of its competition! This store stocks mostly Burmese and Thai items and is set up for the maximum convenience of customers who are in search of the essentials of Asian cuisine, with a friendly staff that is eager to assist those who may still need a bit of help finding what they need. The Niagara Asian Market is two floors of deliciousness, with fresh Asian produce, frozen meats (including unique items such as frog and eel), and staples such as noodles and rice downstairs, and the upper level given over to packaged groceries and a range of health and beauty items. A drawback is the store's exterior signage, which is written almost entirely in Burmese, making the place easily missable from the street.",USA
New York,buy,Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile,"After four years spent in the Elmwood Village, the grand reopening of Buffalo's favorite purveyor of ""udderly unique"" cheeses and other gourmet edibles was a gala event at '''Horsefeathers Market''' in August 2016. Nickel City Cheese's new location is much larger, and really done up nice — like the rest of Horsefeathers, it's an airy space that mixes 19th-century rustic with 21st-century industrial chic, with exposed brick and wood-panelled everything coexisting with trendy exposed ductwork on the ceiling. But the heart and soul of the place remains the same: a selection of domestic and imported cheeses that is second to none in the local area, all cut to order, plus a wide variety of artisanal specialty foods such as jams, pickles, coffees, pasta, mustards, vinegars, sauces, and marinades. And if you're looking for a gift, you can't go wrong with Nickel City Cheese's custom-made gift baskets and cheese-and-charcuterie platters. Best of all, though, with their expansion into new digs has also come an expansion into a whole new arena of business: owner Jill Gedra Forster also operates a full-service restaurant in the adjacent space, '''Lait Cru Brasserie''', open for breakfast and lunch ''(q.v.)''.",USA
New York,buy,Phu Thai Asian Market,"Phu Thai is a family-operated Asian market that was established in 1994, more than a decade before the West Side retail scene was transformed by a tidal wave of similar ethnic food stores. In stark contrast to the pan-Asian selection at supermarkets like '''Sung's''' and '''Hoowa''' — and even to the pan-Southeast Asian inventory at West Side competitors like '''Á Châu''' and the '''Niagara Asian Market''' — the groceries available along these jumbled, narrow aisles are almost exclusively Thai in provenance. Staples such as dried noodles and huge sacks of rice, spices, sauces and cooking oils, and a variety of packaged foods are on offer; in the coolers along the walls are a small selection of vegetables (produce delivery day is Thursday, so try to show up around then if you're in the market for Thai chilies, fresh ginger, or other exotic greens) and a surprisingly ample one of frozen meats and fish. Pluses for this place are a decent variety of good-quality housewares and what must be the best selection of Southeast Asian soft drinks in Buffalo; drawbacks include an unfortunate tendency to not label their merchandise with prices.",USA
New York,buy,West Side Herbs & Alliums,"Though co-owners Neil and Carrie grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables on this lovely agricultural oasis in the heart of the West Side, one look at the name and there's no secret to what the specialties here are. On the one hand you've got onions and garlic — those are the ""alliums"" — but more noteworthy than that is the astonishing selection of herbs they cultivate: multiple different varieties of basil, mint, sage, and rosemary; other well-known pantry staples like parsley, oregano, and dill; not-so-well-known ones like lemon balm and buzz buttons, and an encyclopedic range of medicinal herbs that are perfect for teas and tinctures. Whatever your pleasure, these folks take care to provide their customers with a product that's high in quality and produced in an environmentally conscious way — all of West Side Herbs & Alliums' produce is grown without the use of pesticides, in raised beds so as to sidestep the issue of soil contamination that is the bane of urban farmers across the Rust Belt. And, if you can't make it over on Friday evenings when the onsite farm stand is open, you can buy up these vegetal goodies on Saturday mornings at the '''Elmwood-Bidwell Farmers Market''' or sample them as ingredients at a number of local restaurants including the West Side's own '''Providence Social'''.",USA
New York,buy,Zip's Deli & Grill,"Much more than the average corner bodega that it appears to be from the outside, Zip's Deli and Grill actually carries a full line of ethnic groceries that splits the difference between Middle Eastern (a great selection of halal meats such as chicken and lamb, as well as packaged goods) and Latino (Goya products galore). Groceries are only the beginning, though — at Zip's you can find items as widely varied as hookah pipes, blankets, and prepaid cell phones, and even have your electronics repaired at hard-to-beat prices. The chummy friendliness with which the Arabian owners treat their customers is the icing on the cake.",USA
New York,buy,Burning Books,"This is not your ordinary bookstore, but if you're on the lookout for a unique gift for that hard-to-buy-for far-left radical on your list, Burning Books probably has what you're looking for. Helmed by Nate Buckley, a former '''Earth Liberation Front''' spokesperson whose other claim to fame involves a lengthy legal battle stemming from his arrest at '''Occupy Buffalo''', sold here are an array of books, magazines, and leaflets regarding a diversity of themes of social injustice and revolutionary politics — histories, biographies, reference materials, and even kids' books on topics from the Black Panthers to the Stonewall Riots to the Zapatistas; in the words of one reviewer, ""books that people in power don't want you to read"". T-shirts, calendars, posters, and a selection of documentary films on DVD and audio recordings of speeches and lectures round out the inventory, and concerts, guest speakers, panel discussions, and other events are held frequently. True to its mission and the personality of its soft-spoken yet outgoing owner (this place has doubtless been the scene of some of the most interesting political conversations in the city), the interior of Burning Books is all business: a minimalist scheme of unfinished wood panels draws no attention away from the socially conscious literature for sale. Best of all, the prices here are decidedly 99%-friendly.",USA
New York,buy,Beaver Liquors,"Snicker all you want at its name, but the selection of red wine at this newly established West Side liquor store is no joke. In the short time since it's been founded, Beaver Liquors has already earned accolades for the range and quality of its vintages. Wine is only the beginning here, though — this place also does a brisk business, seven days a week, in a great variety of reasonably-priced spirits of all kinds which trend heavily toward well-known upscale brands. Best of all, curious fans of potent potables can enjoy an active schedule of wine and liquor tastings.",USA
New York,buy,Paradise Wine,"Opened in March 2015, this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise, is a former pastry chef turned self-described ""wine nerd"" who, before she struck out on her own, was a favorite at Amherst's '''Premier Wines & Spirits''' for her encyclopedic knowledge of wines (especially local vintages), discriminating palate, and natural way with customer service. Little wonder, then, that Paradise Wines has already made quite the name for itself in Five Points. With a huge range of products that you won't find anywhere else, Paradise's inventory eschews big-name vintages completely and consists solely of a handpicked selection of organic, biodynamic, sustainably crafted wines (and ciders, craft spirits) sourced from small family wineries in the local area. You might think that all this high-concept stuff is out of your price range, but think again: an integral part of this place's mission is making holistically produced products available to those of all budgets, and the owner is enthusiastic about sharing her treasure trove of wine knowledge to serve each customer's individual needs and palate.",USA
New York,buy,West Side Liquor & Wine,"Newly opened, West Side Liquor & Wine is at the center of the action on Connecticut Street. This is a cute little place, brightly lit and with a cozy ambience, and the friendly employees are eager to steer customers toward some of the best-priced libations in the city — in fact, if you find the same product for less money anywhere in Buffalo, they will beat or match the price. The selection leaves something to be desired, but for those on a budget, West Side Liquors is the place to go. Those who are planning large parties will be happy to know that you can save even more money buying in bulk.",USA
New York,buy,Turnaround Skates,"When she's not tearing up the local rollerderby scene as part of the '''Queen City Roller Girls''', Ilana Gordon can often be found at this out-of-the-way West Side skate shop that she owns. Recreational roller skates, inline skates, and roller-hockey gear are all sold at Turnaround Skates, but the bias here is toward rollerderby gear. As many experienced skaters will tell you, beginners to the sport often battle foot and leg pain that comes from ill-fitting skates lacking in support; one of the goals here is to head that off at the pass, providing customers with honest, expert one-on-one guidance on skates and protective gear to fit their individual needs. The selection is wide and friendly to all budgets — quality brands including Pro-Tec, Atom Wheels, and Sure-Grip are represented on the shelves, and Ilana will even special-order products that aren't in stock for those searching for a specific brand or item. Turnaround's experienced staff provide custom in-store fittings, and you can even trade in old skates for store credit to maximize the already great value you get for your money. Cap off your purchases with stylish skatewear such as hot pants, laces and socks (Day-Glo colors abound). The folks here are friendly as can be and really know their stuff.",USA
New York,buy,Urban Roots,"Urban Roots is a ""community garden center"" that was founded in 2004 by a group of longtime West Side green thumbs who sought an opportunity to spend their hard-earned dollars in the city rather than wasting time and money driving to suburbia for gardening supplies, as well as to help build synergy with their neighbors to promote the beautification and revival of their up-and-coming, but still struggling, neighborhood. Their store opened three years later in the Five Points district, and is run as a cooperative: $100 will buy you lifetime status as a ""member-owner"" with access to exclusive promotions and discounts, first notification of special events and new items in stock, and a voice in store policy. However, you don't need to be a member to shop at Urban Roots! Locals can peruse a gamut of plants of uncommon quality — from the everyday to the unusual, including annuals, perennials, trees, herbs, heirloom plants, and local flora — and if you're a visitor, you can still avail yourself of supplies and accessories such as gardening gloves, flowerpots, bird feeders and birdhouses, cute garden art, and books on gardening, as well as an encyclopedic range of seeds, including '''Baker's Creek''' heirloom seeds and organic, non-GMO '''Seeds of Change'''. Urban Roots' merchandise tends to be pricey, but your money goes to a great cause, and you get a higher-quality product than you'll find elsewhere. Plus, their selection is huge, especially given the modest size of the store, and there's even space left over for frequent seminars, workshops, and seed swaps offered free of charge to members and non-members alike.",USA
New York,buy,Eve Fashion & Beauty Supply,"Located in the '''Dollar General''' shopping plaza on Tonawanda Street in Black Rock, Eve Fashion is a place where clothes, cosmetics, and hair care products are available at prices that defy logic. This store is ''crowded'' — the walls are covered from floor-to-ceiling with merchandise on hangers, and the sales floor is packed with displays — but bargain hunters know that means the selection at Eve can go toe-to-toe with the big department stores. Vivacious tops, dresses, and accessories such as belts and sunglasses represent sassy urban styles, name-brand sneakers at discount prices are available, the selection of jewelry and earrings (big hoops are a recurring motif) is impressive, and fans of pretty much any sports franchise can find their favorite team's baseball cap — but the crown jewel of Eve's inventory is a comprehensive range of hair accessories such as barrettes, beads, pins and clips, as well as styling products for all hair types. As well, the back of the store is given over to a selection of wigs in a variety of styles. Best of all, Eve's staff is friendly and helpful, and those who are interested in taking advantage of Eve's extended evening hours will be happy to know that the place is kept safe under the watchful eye of a collection of security cameras.",USA
New York,buy,Hearts Thrift Store,"This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, is not known for the great diversity of its selection. Nor are folks who come looking for usual thrift-store fare — kooky vintage clothing, hip band t-shirts, designer jeans, and the like — likely to leave satisfied. There ''are'' bargains to be had at Hearts, but the order of the day at this ""businesswoman's thrift store"" (as one reviewer put it) is high-end office attire and formalwear, in tip-top condition and generally dating no earlier than the late 1990s, at prices that can't be beat. Many of the items that fill the racks on the crowded sales floor are sold for as little as $3.00, and occasionally even less. As well, Hearts stocks jewelry, shoes, toys, housewares, and miscellaneous gifts, and boasts an ample selection of kids' clothing. Best of all, the money you spend here could not go to a better cause: the store was set up to benefit '''Hearts for the Homeless''', a faith-based charity that feeds, counsels and ministers to the homeless population of Buffalo. Those who want to donate new or gently used clothing, accessories, or housewares can do so whenever the store is open, and online donations are also accepted through PayPal.",USA
New York,buy,3 Star Fashion,"Recently moved to a new location on Niagara Street right on the border between Black Rock and Riverside, 3 Star Fashion will be familiar to those who enjoy the selection of designer sneakers at '''Empire Kicks''', located on West Ferry Street and run by the same owners. Like its sister store, the fundament of this place's inventory consists of Nikes, Timberlands, Air Jordans and other well-known brands of footwear, but there's also a full range of name-brand clothing for the streetwise man, woman or child on your list, as well as a blockbuster selection of fitted New Era caps. Notably, 3 Star is also a great place to seek out designer jeans at reasonable prices.",USA
New York,buy,Tomahawk Garments,"Don't be fooled by first impressions: this small, unassuming Black Rock storefront on a mostly residential stretch of Niagara Street houses a real heavyweight of the local retail scene. Here you can purchase Tomahawk brand leather goods — coats, vests and jackets, biker gear, accessories such as belts, gloves and handbags, wallets, backpacks and on and on — produced right in Western New York and united by an unrelenting emphasis on quality. This stuff is really top-of-the-line: it's no wonder Tomahawk leatherware sells for a pretty penny at fine department stores in the area, but at their Niagara Street outlet you can get it for 50 to 70% off retail prices. As if that weren't enough, a ""web discount"" is available for those who call Tomahawk's toll-free number, and customers who live outside New York State can have items shipped to them with sales tax — and in some cases, even shipping charges — waived.",USA
New York,buy,Gothic City Antiques,"The big, '50s-looking '''Streng Oldsmobile''' sign just past Exit 13 is a familiar landmark to those Western New Yorkers whose daily commute takes them along the northbound I-190, but what many of them don't know is that the junk lot on which it sits isn't a junk lot at all: it's Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts. Family-owned and operated since 1971, Gothic City specializes in restoring historic homes and buildings with proper period architectural elements — but even if you don't own a drafty old Victorian of your own, anyone who's looking for that perfect piece to bring character to their home would be well-advised to spend a day here. Gothic City's massive footprint includes not only the lot visible from the Interstate — a full acre (4,000 squ. m.) filled with planters, statuary, garden tchotchkes, old lampposts, and the famous sign that once stood guard outside the Oldsmobile dealership on Main Street — but also 19,000 square feet (1,750 squ. m.) of showroom and warehouse space in the restored former '''Unity Temple''' Masonic lodge, which contains a dizzying array of antique furniture, lamps and sconces, doors and doorknobs, mantels, vintage plumbing fixtures such as sinks and claw bathtubs, and even a fine collection of ornamental ironwork and religious artifacts. Other antiques, such as toys and collectibles, are also represented. This place is only open three days a week, but no matter — if you're here at the beginning of the week, just get into contact with owner Charlie Leone and he'll open up shop for you if he can.",USA
New York,buy,Aldulaimi Buffalo Bakery,"Once a drive-in ice cream stand, contained within this unassuming little building in Riverside is a dazzling wealth of delicious Middle Eastern foods. Not surprisingly, baked goods are the star of the show here — the fresh, crusty bread whipped up in-house every day by friendly owner Omar Aldulaimi comes in several varieties, all out of this world, and he'll also bake custom orders if you call in advance — but at Aldulaimi Bakery you also have your pick of hummus, falafel, cheese, and delicious Levantine pastries. This is as authentic as it gets in Buffalo, so don't miss out.",USA
New York,buy,Fowler's Chocolates,"An anonymous-looking industrial park backed up against the old '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks in an out-of-the-way corner of Black Rock may seem like an odd place for Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers to locate one of their seven Western New York-area chocolate shops — but after all, this is the same building where their chocolate factory has been located since 1993. Unsurprisingly, the small retail space just off the production floor keeps abbreviated hours compared to the other Fowler's locations, but if you happen to be in the neighborhood on a weekday morning or afternoon and have a hankering for sponge candy, chocolate truffles, or any of the other goodies these folks are famous for, you're more than welcome to stop in.",USA
New York,buy,Gondola Macaroni Products,"Gondola Macaroni Products is a longstanding local business whose deep West Side roots endure despite the radical changes the surrounding neighborhood has undergone since 1958. That's the year when Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''', designed and built his own pasta maker and began cooking ravioli in the kitchen of the West Side house he shared with his wife Maria — ravioli which quickly became a neighborhood sensation. Ravioli is still the marquee product customers line up for in this cramped little shop in Black Rock. It's made daily in-house from scratch with a simple recipe of durum flour, water, and eggs — there's no additives or chemicals in this stuff, which is likely why its quality puts supermarket fare to shame. Into the ravioli are stuffed your choice of cheese, meat, spinach, or lobster (imitation — it's only $4 a tray, after all — but still delicious), and they along with other filled pastas like cheese tortellini and stuffed shells are available fresh or frozen. Gondola's dried pasta boasts a bit more variety; options range from the expected (plain, angel hair, roasted red pepper, garlic pesto) to the unexpected (squid ink?!?) All this for prices that can hold their own with much larger players like '''Wegmans''' and '''Tops''', and served to you with a smile by owners that obviously appreciate your business, even if their English isn't quite up to snuff.",USA
New York,buy,Htar Ni Asian Market,"Yet another in the seemingly endless parade of Burmese grocery stores on the West Side, Htar Ni Asian Market is located on Ontario Street toward the north end of Riverside. Inside, you'll find walls lined with rows upon rows of canned goods, jars of preserved vegetables, packaged groceries, frozen foods, and crunchy snacks. If you like Sriracha and other spicy Asian sauces and condiments, Htar Ni is the place for you.",USA
New York,buy,Lin Asian Market,"The second, somewhat larger location of this place that opened in Riverside in December 2014 features more of the same specialty Asian groceries that you can find at Lin's Grant Street location. The store is connected directly to '''Lin Restaurant''' next door, so if you just finished dining and you want to try your hand at making your own version of the Burmese and Thai specialties served there, you're in luck.",USA
New York,buy,Steel Crazy Iron Art,"Owners Ed & Brian Hogle worked in the construction industry for over a quarter century before striking out on their own in 2004, setting up shop in the former '''Black Rock Harbor Commons''' warehouse complex and translating their experience in structural iron- and steelwork into designing customized works of metal art, handcrafted with expert precision by their experienced staff using the latest in computerized design technology. Steel Crazy Iron Art specializes in ""gifts for the ungiftable"" — they'll custom-design everything from key racks to desk mounts to custom-themed clocks, and they're even responsible for many of the bright blue ""buffalo head"" bike racks you see along the sidewalk in trendy neighborhoods like the Elmwood Village and Allentown. Military-themed items are particularly popular; American servicepeople are honored with specially designed medallions, wall hangings, personalized dog tags, and the like representative of every branch of the U.S. military. Similar goods are available for police officers and firefighters, and even that hard-to-buy-for dentist or chiropractor on your list are covered with stainless-steel wall hangings in the shape of spinal columns and teeth!",USA
New York,buy,Totaro Stained Glass,"Custom-designed stained and beveled glass windows — produced and delivered with, in their words, ""old-world craftsmanship and service"" — is the specialty at this renowned workshop that recently moved from Grant-Amherst to the former '''Jubilee Library''' in Black Rock, right next door to '''Gothic City Antiques'''. The designs favored by owner Jace Totaro tend toward abstract patterns, but he and the other craftsmen at Totaro Stained Glass are happy to help bring to life any idea the customer may have. The staff here is also known for their expertise at restoring and repairing antique stained glass windows.",USA
New York,buy,City Liquor,"The small size of this neighborhood liquor store at the north end of Riverside belies the huge variety of name-brand beers, wines and spirits available within. What's more, City Liquor's staff is knowledgeable and friendly and sells its wares for some of the best prices around.",USA
New York,buy,Nuchereno Liquor Store,"Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store is located, as it has been since 1943, just across the street from Riverside Park. Though a wide variety of potent libations are on offer at this friendly neighborhood business, the specialty at the Nuchereno Liquor Store is an ample selection of fine wines of all descriptions, carefully stored in a temperature-controlled environment at a constant temperature of 55°F (12°C) for maximum quality.",USA
New York,buy,Big Catch Bait & Tackle,"At Big Catch Bait & Tackle, the name only tells half the story. Sure, it's a great place to pick up pretty much any type of bait you want, live or otherwise. Sure, its location on Niagara Street in Black Rock is convenient to lots of great fishing spots and boat launches on the upper Niagara River. Sure, you can get wholesale fishing tackle, pick up a New York State hunting or fishing license, and stock up on various and sundry other outdoor goods. But Big Catch also does double duty as a purveyor of a modest but high-quality range of paintball guns and supplies, with an emphasis on Tippmann brand products — the A-5 and X7 Phenom guns are particular favorites that are sold at great prices, and CO2 refills don't come cheaper anywhere in Western New York. Best of all, no matter whether you're a fisherman or a paintballer, the staff at Big Catch will provide you with helpful and friendly service to match the great deals.",USA
New York,buy,Obersheimer's Sailor Supply,"Even in the 21st Century, there are still a lot of folks who come to Buffalo by boat — perhaps as the finale of a pleasure cruise along the Erie Canal, perhaps from a port of call elsewhere on the Great Lakes. If you're one of them, and you're in the market for some new gear for your boat, Obersheimer's Sailor Supply is the place for you. Since 1970, owner and namesake Charlie Obersheimer has stocked a full range of marine supplies and accessories in this huge chandlery in the heart of Black Rock. Sailboat rigging is a specialty here — the upper level of this cavernous edifice is given over to a full sail loft where expert technicians happily fit out, sew or repair sails with spars up to 65 feet (20 m). Goods such as halyards, furlers and adjusters are sold for reasonable prices, ropes and wires are spliced, and knowledgeable staff are always on hand to give advice. Obersheimer's doesn't leave powerboaters out in the cold either — outboard motors representing a range of brands are sold and serviced, with a particular emphasis on Nissan and Tohatsu models, as well as a range of parts and accessories.",USA
New York,buy,Riverside Fabric Center,"It's a shame that Riverside Fabric Center's limited hours scare off a lot of would-be customers, because the quality of the goods sold here — especially the lace — is worth going out of your way for. If you're in the market for fabrics, various and sundry sewing supplies, or to have a dress or other piece custom-made for you, you can scarcely do better. The incredibly friendly staff, helmed by owner Lena Harnish, is the icing on the cake.",USA
New York,buy,The String Shoppe,"Ed Taublieb is the man who holds court every Saturday at the String Shoppe, the music store of choice for Black Rock and Riverside that specializes in a full range of quality new and used guitars and other string instruments to fit all budgets, and is an authorized dealer in Martin and Taylor guitars and Hohner harmonicas. An aficionado of the local folk scene in the '60s who fell into the business after buying and repairing his own used guitars to play at '''The Lime Light''', '''The Lower Level''', and other storied Buffalo venues of bygone days, Ed's been in business for almost half a century now — and he's still the String Shoppe's owner and sole employee. You're never going to get the kind of sincere personal attention you get here at a big chain like '''Guitar Center''' — not only does Taublieb personally inspect and adjust every instrument prior to sale, but he's always on hand to guide customers through his ample inventory and draw on his encyclopedic knowledge of his craft to help them through the selection process. Taublieb will also proudly repair or restring your guitar or other instrument. Aside from the aforementioned range of instruments, the String Shoppe stocks guitar cases, accessories such as strings, picks, straps, and pearl inlays, amps and pedals, and a modest range of books and sheet music.",USA
New York,eat,Albert's,"Since 1990, this unpretentious hangout at the corner of Grant and Ferry has served up ""The Flavor of Old Times"", with reasonably-priced Greek and American fare and renowned fish fry ever Friday. Albert's is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and boasts a lively full bar where beer and cocktails are served.",USA
New York,eat,Boomerang's Bar & Grill,"Boomerang's is so named because ""the food's so good, you'll keep coming back"" — and it must be true, because Buffalonians really love this place. In an ambience that is relaxed and welcoming despite its spartan decor is served an extensive range of delicious cuisine that comes in portions that are huge and prices that aren't. The menu is eclectic, if unadventurous: the slate of main courses is slightly skewed toward Italian food, with a wide range of pasta dishes on offer as well as chicken entrées served in marsala, florentine, parmigiana and cacciatore styles. This is not to deprecate the wide range of other items on Boomerang's menu: beef Stroganoff, BBQ spare ribs, and a variety of sandwiches and burgers all make an appearance. Worthy of special mention are several interesting takes on porkchops — the raspberry porkchops with crumbly blue cheese has been described as an interesting combination of flavors that, perhaps surprisingly, harmonizes well. Diners also heap special praise on the appetizers here: ""you don't really know corn chowder until you've had this"", says one reviewer about Boomerang's most popular soup. A kids' menu is also available. It should be said, however, that the service is this place's Achilles heel: it's not so much bad as inconsistent, ranging wildly from warm and friendly to bitter and sarcastic.",USA
New York,eat,La Gourmet Empanadas,"This new restaurant opened in late 2014 in an enormous, beautifully restored former Oddfellows Hall which was most recently used as the '''Mount Major Banquet Hall''' (true to that former identity, they still host banquets and other special events here of up to 100 people). La Gourmet Empanadas does indeed serve the titular South American specialty, in savory versions stuffed with chicken, pulled pork, beef, or salmon, vegetarian options with black beans, as well as dessert empanadas with fruit fillings. Aside from that, though, visitors may find the name a bit deceiving: the rest of the menu reads like that of a neighborhood pizzeria, with a fairly mundane (if perfectly well-executed) range of offerings comprised of pizza and wings, hot and cold subs, burgers, chicken fingers and other simple fare, as well as barbeque ribs. But by far the most interesting — not to mention surprising — non-empanada option on the menu is Hawaiian-style ''huli-huli'' rotisserie, available in either chicken or pork.",USA
New York,eat,Rancho's,"One of a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's is a Venezuelan sandwich shop that opened in December 2015 at the former location of '''Rascal's''', on an up-and-coming stretch of Niagara Street. Venezuelan food is the name of the game here: owner Joel Perez is a recently arrived immigrant who came to Buffalo from his former home in Aragua State, and he's already turning heads among the West Side's increasingly numerous foodie community. The specialty here is ''arepas'', flatbread sandwiches that are a popular breakfast food in Colombia and Venezuela. Rancho's serves theirs not only at breakfast time but all day long; the naturally gluten-free corn flour in the bread is fried to a crisp and stuffed with your choice of rotisserie beef, shredded beef, chicken, or roast pork. Those who've travelled to Venezuela and experienced the cuisine on its home turf say they can't tell the difference. The menu doesn't stop there, though — hearty appetizers and side dishes include baked ''yuca'' drizzled in delicious avocado salsa, ''patacón pisao'' (shredded beef sliders with mashed fried plantain fritters as ""bread""), and ''tequeños'' (sort of a South American take on mozzarella sticks: fried ''queso blanco'' with garlic and herb salsa for dipping). As well, available on weekends only is what may be the greatest selection on the menu: ''sancocho'', a hearty chicken and beef soup thickened with potatoes and cassava, sweetened a little with corn on the cob, and seasoned with fresh cilantro; Venezuelan comfort food ''par excellence''. Rancho's prices are extremely reasonable, with nothing on the menu over $10, and Perez and his staff seem eager to convert curious first-time visitors into loyal repeat customers — this means expect super friendly and attentive service, and maybe a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your order.",USA
New York,eat,Santasiero's,"A relic from the days when the West Side was Buffalo's ""Little Italy"", hearty family-style Italian meals have been served at Santasiero's for almost a century now. The Italian wedding soup is spectacular, and sandwiches and dishes such as chicken parmigiana are available, but Santasiero's is most famous for the heaping portions of pasta they serve along with legendary red sauce. Reasonable prices, too.",USA
New York,eat,Sweetness 7,"Since 2007, Prish Moran has operated her friendly old-world coffee shop in this beautiful and historic old Victorian building on Grant Street. The opening of Sweetness 7 is largely the reason why the Grant-Ferry area has been as trendy and up-and-coming as it has been for the past few years. Popular with artists, hipsters, and Buffalo State College students, Sweetness 7 serves fresh gourmet sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza, and pastry along with the coffee, and their breakfast is also very popular with locals.",USA
New York,eat,West Side Bazaar,"The West Side Bazaar's '''International Kitchen''' is the center of the universe for local fans of exotic international flavors: its food stalls serve a dizzying range of international cuisines — including some (such as South Sudanese and Rakhine) that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo — and at unbeatable prices to boot. Best of all, the food here is as authentic as it gets; by and large, the Bazaar's customer base are immigrants and refugees like those who work there, so you won't be disappointed by watered-down, Americanized versions of your favorite ethnic fare.",USA
New York,eat,Abyssinia,"Abyssinia is Buffalo's fourth and newest Ethiopian restaurant — and, according to a growing consensus, its best. Helmed by owner Zelalem Gemmeda, an Ethiopian native who's lived in Buffalo since 2006, Abyssinia's menu is divided about evenly between meat-based and vegetarian dishes and populated by all the standard Ethiopian favorites — ''doro watt'', beef and lamb ''tibs'', ''kitfo'', ''alitcha'', and so forth. Also, like its competition, those who can't decide or aren't familiar with the cuisine can order combo platters: either a mixture of meat and vegetarian dishes or all vegetarian, for $9.99 and $8.99 respectively. However, what sets Abyssinia apart is the authenticity of the recipes — complex, nuanced and intoxicating flavors that, unlike many of Buffalo's other Ethiopian restaurants, don't skimp on the spice (this is especially true of the vegetarian dishes). The ''sambusa'' are so good you won't mind that they skimp on the chutney. Recently, Abyssinia's menu has expanded to include pasta with marinara sauce, as well as a few Arabian specialties such as ''foul'' and chicken ''biryani'', available on Sundays and Mondays only. Perhaps this place's only weakness is the ''injera'': they skimp on that too (though you can ask for extra at no charge), and it lacks that slight vinegary tang.",USA
New York,eat,007 Chinese Food,"Thanks to 007 Chinese Food, in the words of one reviewer, ""it's a happy day — dumplings are back at the West Side Bazaar!"" Indeed, despite the multicultural vibrancy of the restaurants that have come and gone from the International Kitchen in the years since '''Jolie's Traditional Chinese Food''' moved to the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the Lower West Side, it's always seemed to many like there's been something missing. Enter Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' and other delectable little Chinese appetizers whose recipes he perfected at the restaurant he and his family ran in Malaysia before coming to Buffalo. The stars of the show on 007's modest-sized menu are the ''lo mai fan'' (balls of sticky rice mixed with stir-fried chicken and mushrooms, with sriracha sauce on the side for dipping), and of course, the steamed ''shu mai'' stuffed with your choice of beef, chicken, or vegetables. You probably won't be able to make a full meal out of any of these items, but they work spectacularly as appetizers to accompany a main course from one of the Bazaar's other food vendors — whatever you order here, be assured it's prepared fresh by hand in front of you and bursting with flavor (the exception being the ''pau'', which, even more than usual with Chinese steamed buns, tend toward the dry and doughy.) Complimentary hot tea is served with any order on request. Service at 007 is as friendly as can be, but often complicated by a language barrier — Maung's wife, who you'll often see running the restaurant, speaks very little English; if you have more complex questions or comments, you should seek out her husband or son, who are fluent.",USA
New York,eat,Family Thai,"It's perhaps a testament to the singular nature of the West Side Bazaar that Family Thai is its least ""exotic"" dining option. Served here at the International Kitchen's newest restaurant are an impressive variety of Thai dishes such as ''pad thai'', ''pad see ew'', ''yum'' salads, and various curries in sizable portions. The emphasis here is on authenticity, and though service tends to be slow, it's worth the wait: one reviewer described the fare at Family Thai as ""light-years ahead of the other [Thai] eateries in town"".",USA
New York,buy,Gourmet Lao Foods,"Co-owners New Phanthady and Boulivone Serixay have taken the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''A&A Cookies''' to the next level. Yes, you can still find ''dok jok'' here — the confection that endeared this booth to legions of West Side Bazaar regulars; a light, crispy, and sublimely delicious cookie of thin, coconut milk-infused dough folded in a lotus blossom shape — along with all the other pastries and snacks as before, and the bubble tea too. But now they also serve a selection of main courses from their native Laos; a modest range of noodle salads, stir-fried meat salads, soups, and samosas that make up in fresh, delicious flavor what they lack in portion size. Also, as if to make up for a weak point in most of the International Kitchen's other food stalls, a full range of bottled soft drinks is also available.",USA
New York,eat,M Asian Halal Foods,"In 2015, the owner of the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''Exotic Japanese Crepes''' moved across the corridor from his small freestanding stall to a much larger window in the '''International Kitchen''', and with that expanded space came an expanded menu of delicious food. Thus was the birth of M Asian Halal Foods. The crepes remain — a bit of a misnomer as they don't come from Japan, these thin, crispy pancakes with sweet or savory toppings were invented in Thailand and inscrutably dubbed ""Japanese"", an object lesson in the cross-pollination of Asian culinary traditions — but are now accompanied by a full range of 100% halal Indian and Pakistani specialties. The bulk of the menu is a fairly run-of-the-mill roster of butter chicken, pakora, biryani, vegetarian and nonvegetarian samosas, and tandoori chicken, but M Asian's menu also boasts a few more offbeat items like ''chapli'' (savory patties of Indian-spiced ground chicken that come with a small salad on the side), and South Indian cuisine is represented by a fairly ample selection of ''dosas'' topped with coconut chutney and your choice of vegetarian or goat curry. Food is reliable but not outstanding in quality, but the reasonable prices and service with a smile make M Asian worthwhile.",USA
New York,eat,Pwint War,"2016 was a banner year for the West Side Bazaar's resident purveyor of Burmese cuisine, as the torch was passed to a new generation of the Soe family, and the former '''Kyel Sein Hein''' was rechristened Pwint War. Along with the new name came a new menu that takes the prize as the most authentic in Buffalo: eschewing the Thai fare that sometimes makes up the majority of the menu at other so-called ""Burmese"" restaurants in the area, almost every one of the huge range of tasty specialties served up at Pwint War are made with recipes native to Myanmar, with the sole exception of a superlative ''yum nua'' wherein a touch of sweetness offsets the fire of the chilis and the tang of the lime juice. Also served are what are easily the most authentic Burmese curries to be found in Buffalo (your choice of beef, chicken, pork belly, goat, grilled fish, or fish cakes; opt for a side of white rice for $2 extra), a seemingly endless variety of fried rice and noodle dishes, a Burmese take on ''biryani'' with your choice of meat, as well as a few holdovers from the old Kyel Sein Hein menu such as tomato salad and Shan noodles — and yes, these days you can even get ''le peth thoat'' (pickled tea leaf salad) at the Bazaar! The only unfortunate casualty of the changeover was the dropping of ''mohinga'' from the regular menu, though it still reappears as a daily special from time to time. Prices have gone up a little bit, but so has the quality of the food, and you get the same friendly service as always.",USA
New York,eat,Rakhapura Mutee & Sushi,"This place's menu is an interesting juxtaposition: 30 varieties of sushi accompany a range of options native to Myanmar's Rakhine State. The sushi made by owner Khaing Thein is not particularly inspiring, though it is fresh and tasty. Options include a ""Buffalo roll"" with cream cheese, crab salad, and cucumber, as well as the mango banana roll, probably the place's most popular, which is prepared with fish sauce for a bit of extra spice. In fact, ""a bit of spice"" is an excellent summation of the main non-sushi item on the menu: the ''rakhaing mutee'', a variation of classic Burmese ''mohinga'' particular to Rakhine State, though Rakhapura's version substitutes chicken broth for the usual base of conger eel. It's a hearty, healthy, and indescribably delicious soup; a garlicky, slightly tangy broth with rice vermicelli and coriander, served with dried, crushed red chilis on the side if you want a bit more heat. Perhaps the best part of Rakhapura, however, is the owner: a longtime pro-democracy agitator, Thein escaped Myanmar with his life in 1996 and now spends his off hours lecturing around the area on the political and human rights situation in his homeland, which often makes for interesting conversations with customers!",USA
New York,eat,Freddy J's BBQ,"Freddy J's may be a tiny little place, but a tsunami of flavor is packed inside these walls. In these cramped digs — about a half-dozen bar stools and a few outdoor tables in season are all the place holds — supremely friendly chef Fred Daniel, a native of Liberia who now hosts the local cable-access cooking show ''Late Night Noise'', cooks up what some describe as the best barbeque in Buffalo. The recipes, cooked with fresh ingredients sourced as often as possible from local neighbors like '''Guercio's''' and the '''West Side Bazaar''', are as authentic and time-tested as it gets, yet Freddy J's also manages to incorporate subtle Cajun and Caribbean influences into their dishes — witness the jerk chicken and fish, whose subtle but noticeable heat is assuaged by sides of yellow rice and ""Honey Hush cornbread"". The wings and ribs are slathered with just the right amount of sauce, and the fried haddock, served with mac & cheese, green beans, and (once again) cornbread, is a serviceable Southern-style approximation of classic Buffalo fish fry. Brunch is served Sunday mornings and afternoons till 3PM with bottomless mimosas.",USA
New York,eat,Gypsy Parlor,"Don't be confused by the red neon sign in the window that says ""PSYCHIC READINGS"" — this isn't that kind of gypsy parlor! Owned by Gabrielle Mattina and named and themed in an homage to her Roma ancestry, this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor serves delicious food in an ambience that's airy yet intimate (reservations are recommended on weekends), comfortable yet garishly decorated. The bulk of the small menu is made up of light fare such as salads and sandwiches; most interestingly, a selection of appetizers dubbed ""West Side Delicacies"" are offered in a nod to the neighborhood's cultural diversity, and the ''pastelillos'', samosas and Burmese spring rolls hold their own with anything that's available at the '''West Side Bazaar'''. Really, you won't find anything more substantial at the Gypsy Parlor than the pair of half-pound burgers that are among the most popular items on the menu — either ""Classic American"" or ""Black Sheep"", the latter a decidedly upscale concoction of peppercorn-crusted ground lamb topped with a dijon & beet coleslaw. What you ''will'' find here is friendly, attentive service and food at a decent price.",USA
New York,eat,Marco's,"Nowadays, chef Marco Sciotino is probably more famous around these parts for helming the growing lineup of '''Marco's Italian Deli''' locations, but this cozy old place on Niagara Street is where it all began in 1988, when he purchased the erstwhile '''Darone's Fargo Grille''' and adorned it with his own name. The restaurant still has the no-frills ambience of a humble neighborhood bar, and fans of hearty, homestyle red-sauce Italian fare won't find anything unexpected on the menu, but don't let that fool you — this is creatively conceived, artfully executed food (even though the bread and herbed olive oil still comes off as a bit of an affectation) served in copious amounts for fair prices. All the usual suspects can be found on the menu — starters of antipasto salad, pasta fagioli, fava beans, and stuffed banana peppers, veal and chicken served in marsala, parmigiana, piccata and florentine styles, pasta dishes such as pomodoro and linguine with clam sauce — but fans of spice might want to try the ""Paesano Inferno"", a fiery delight of hot Italian fennel sausage and sautéed hot peppers served over penne pasta.",USA
New York,eat,Pho Dollar,"The East Side's '''Pho 99''' introduced Buffalonians to Vietnamese cuisine when it opened in 1999, and though many restaurants and noodle shops have come and gone since then, it was not for fifteen years that the supremacy of their food was seriously challenged on the local level. The new kid on the block is the oddly named Pho Dollar, which not only serves incredibly delicious food — intoxicating interpretations of the trademark flavors of Southeast Asia — but boasts far more interesting and creative options on its extensive menu than 99 or any other place in Buffalo. Diners will strain to read the small-print English translations on the menu options, but those who do will be dazzled by a wide range of Vietnamese specialties (along with a small sampling of Cambodian and Thai items) including Buffalo's widest selection of ''pho'' (almost but not quite as good as 99's), a range of other soups, ''bun'' vermicelli bowls, stir-fried rice and noodle dishes, as well as heartier entrees. The appetizer section features not only the usual spring rolls and pot stickers, but a slate of to-die-for ''banh mi'' sandwiches. This delicious ambrosia is served up in an ambience that is sleek if not exactly minimalist (it's a much larger and more upscale place than it looks like from the street!) by servers that are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Best of all, Pho Dollar is open late, and a liquor license is forthcoming.",USA
New York,eat,Vineeta International Foods,"Rajinder and Sujata Chauhan, erstwhile owners of the similar but much smaller '''Lincoln Park Market''' in Tonawanda, purchased in December 2012 the 900-square-foot (830 m²) former home of '''Aaron's Rent-to-Own''' on Grant Street, opening this international supermarket named after their young daughter. An immigrant-run business rife with ambition, Vineeta International Foods is a one-stop shop for unusual and exotic foods and merchandise you won't find anywhere else in the city. Let there be no understatement: this is ''the'' place to come for an all-encompassing range of imported groceries from the Indian subcontinent, East and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, including spices, curries and chutneys, fresh vegetables, frozen foods, packaged groceries, an impressive line of Goya products, a butcher section including a modest range of halal meats, as well as housewares, bath and beauty supplies, and the like. Munch on some of Mrs. Chauhan's delicious samosas — some say they're the best in the city — while you shop. Vineeta's sole sticking point is the produce section, which as often as not consists of an uninspiring range of past-their-prime vegetables, but things seem to be improving on this front lately.",USA
New York,eat,Hot Mama's Canteen,"Usually at a restaurant the condiments are little more than an afterthought, but at Hot Mama's Canteen they're the ''raison d'être'': this brand-new dining destination in Grant-Amherst was conceived by co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") as a showcase for '''Headstone Heat''' hot sauces, which she owns and whose company headquarters share space with the restaurant in a Civil War-era brick house at the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road that once housed the venerable old '''Hilliker's Pastime''' bar. The menu is short and to the point, and the food on it — described in a recent ''Buffalo Rising'' article as ""comfort food with a twist... familiar, but just different enough for you to think about why you had never thought to do that before"" — consists of simple favorites like homemade sandwiches and burgers, heartier mains such as meatloaf dinners, appetizers such as salads and massive softball-sized arancini, and even breakfast fare, each expertly paired with a fiery Headstone Heat sauce to accentuate the delicious flavors. Also, this place serves the most delectable homemade, hand-cut fries you've ever tasted, and the bar features not only a great selection of beers on tap but also a fully restored vintage shuffleboard table. Meli and co-owner Jeff Davis bring a funky Allentown-type vibe to this place — they're alumni of '''Nietzsche's''' and '''Allen Street Hardware Café''', respectively — for an overall effect that is ""a throwback to the old muscle car and pinup days"", according to one reviewer: friendly, efficient service with a heaping side of charming sass.",USA
New York,eat,Lucy,"Much like its namesake (a 3.2 million-year-old ''australopithecus'' discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at that time the most complete specimen of a prehistoric human ancestor ever found), Lucy is a pioneer — local foodies' prayers were answered in early 2012 when Abba Biyan and Naima Tesfu established Buffalo's first Ethiopian restaurant, serving a cuisine whose absence on the Niagara Frontier had long been noted. It was worth the wait: though three more Ethiopian places have since opened their doors, Lucy is still the hands-down favorite; according to out-of-towners, Lucy serves among the best Ethiopian food you can get anywhere in the country. Visitors are quick to forgive the crowded dining room, no-frills decor, and sometimes inattentive service (an inevitable side effect of this tiny place's popularity) to feast on huge portions of traditional dishes such as ''doro watt'', ''tibs'' and ''sambusa'' that come packed with flavor, perfectly spiced, and served with plenty of injera — a flat, spongy bread used in place of silverware to scoop the food into one's mouth. Many options are available for vegetarians and vegans, and unique among its competitors, a full slate of Ethiopian breakfast options are offered (go for the $9.99 ""Lucy Special"" for a sampler of four breakfast items of your choice). Wash it all down with some of the most delicious sweet chai Buffalo has to offer, but perhaps more interestingly, on Saturday evenings from 3PM-7PM a free traditional coffee ceremony is held.",USA
New York,eat,Nick's Place,"Described in the pages of the ''Buffalo News'' as ""an institution on Amherst Street"", Nick's Place was actually located for its first five years on Elmwood Avenue in Park Meadow, where it was founded in 1994 by Greek immigrant Peter Ananiadis. Open daily for breakfast and lunch, what sets Nick's apart are little homestyle touches like the delicious homemade bread baked daily, as well as its Texas sauce which is used not on hot dogs (as is customary in Buffalo) but as a topping for some of the omelettes that dominate the breakfast menu. These are huge and uniformly delicious, with items like feta cheese, souvlaki and gyro meat available alongside the usual ingredients as part of the ""create your own omelette"" option. Lunch is characterized by the usual Greek diner fare such as open souvlaki and gyro, with burgers, wraps and club sandwiches rounding out the selections. Portions are huge and prices aren't, and a full kids' menu is available.",USA
New York,eat,The Dapper Goose,"The Dapper Goose filled a longstanding void in the Amherst Street dining scene when it opened in September 2016 in the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar''' — and it did so with aplomb; the place began racking up accolades from satisfied customers and reviewers in the national (!) and local press almost from opening day. The man behind it all is Keith Raimondi, an Olean native who built his reputation at a series of increasingly trendy culinary hotspots in Philadelphia before returning to his old stomping grounds to pull off his crowning achievement. He certainly had big shoes to fill — Mark Goldman, his predecessor in this space, is a local legend — and true to form, the old BRKB has been extensively reimagined in a style described by ''Step Out Buffalo'' as a ""turn-of-the-century supper club feel"", but which Raimondi and his staff prefer to call ""classic French cottage"": the walls are painted with pastel tones, giving a pleasant airy feel to the dining room that's perfect for the rustic wood of the furnishings and huge bar. Speaking of, it's the bar that has earned the Dapper Goose most of its hype thus far — served is a modest but carefully selected range of creative cocktails with a highlight on locally produced craft spirits from the likes of '''Lockhouse Distillery''' and '''Tommyrotter''', as well as an impressive wine list founded on European (especially French) vintages and a respectable selection of beer and cider too. But regardless of what the reviewers say, Raimondi wholeheartedly rejects any notion that the food cooked up by head chef Peggy Wong is merely an afterthought to the bar. Similar to the drink menu, the food menu is small in size but well-curated, and focused on the very best of what local producers have to offer. This is ""New American cuisine"" at its best, drawing from a diversity of influences including Continental, Asian, and (especially) Latin American flares to craft a range of dishes that are among the most creative and well thought out you'll find anywhere in Buffalo. Small plates abound — favorites include an appetizer of crispy golden-fried cauliflower drizzled in a dill-rich ""Green Goddess"" dressing, as well as a snapper served in a ceviche with coconut broth and hot peppers (deliciously fresh and not as daunting as it sounds for those who can't handle spice) — but easily the most popular item on the menu is the sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken: a huge bone-in thigh, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, served on a bed of kimchi fried rice and spicy pickled cucumbers whose sharp taste is the perfect offset. Fresh seasonal produce abounds, as do ample options for vegetarians — and best of all, you won't break the bank on the bill that comes at the end of the meal. Brunch coming soon.",USA
New York,eat,The Phoenix,"The name ""The Phoenix"" is apropos on several levels: it pays homage to the resurgent neighborhood in which it's located, as well as to the building itself, a former working-class gin mill that was extensively renovated by owner Mary Logue after a devastating fire (preservationists rejoice: the original brass-railed bar, hardwood flooring and tin ceiling were saved and are still in place, and the exterior is bedecked by an unmissable metal sign, locally crafted just down the road at '''Atlas Steel'''). Opened in March 2013, this ""American Tavern"" is a place for simple but delectably-prepared food served in an ambience that is a pleasant blend of classy and casual. The menu betrays diverse influences — from Polish (lazy pierogi and kielbasa, one of the Phoenix's most popular main courses) to Belgian (steak frites) to South American (flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce) — augmented by a modest but expertly curated selection of wines and specialty cocktails that really attest to this place's upscale touch. A decent selection of bottled local and regional craft brews is available as well. Best of all, diners rave about the dedication displayed by the waitstaff, as well as Logue herself, who can often be seen working the hostess stand and ensuring with sincere concern that each guest leaves satisfied. Reservations are highly recommended for Friday and Saturday nights especially; in warm weather, try for a table on the patio out back, whose pleasant coziness is an extension of the dining room's.",USA
New York,eat,Armory Restaurant,"Located in the shadow of the gargantuan '''Connecticut Street Armory''' (hence its name), this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, is a throwback to the olden days of the West Side as Buffalo's Little Italy. The order of the day at the Armory Restaurant is simple, homestyle Italian, hearty and delicious. Interestingly, there is no set menu here — the offerings consist solely of a changing slate of daily specials, of which there are about eight or nine at any given time. Favorites include the lentil soup, a sausage sandwich made with spicy '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and a concoction known as ""The Brick"": an ample portion of baked ziti that features a blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses as well as the most mouth-watering red sauce you've ever tasted. The Armory has been a favorite meeting place and lunchtime hangout for Buffalo politicians since the 1960s, when the West Side's own Frank Sedita served as mayor. Political bigwigs aren't the only folks you'll see there, though; the place also has a loyal following among D'Youville College's student body (likely because of the prices, which are a remarkable value for what you get). The ambience is friendly and without a hint of pretension, and the service is remarkably quick.",USA
New York,eat,BreadHive Cooperative Bakery,"BreadHive was launched by local trio Emily Stewart, Allison Ewing and Tori Kuper, who adapted the philosophy of the '''Nickel City Housing Co-op''' — of which all three are former residents — to the concept of an artisanal bakery: the business is cooperatively owned by all its employees and selflessly gives back to the community that supports it through the ""bread-share"" program they've dubbed ""the Crust Belt"". As before, bagels remain BreadHive's best-known specialty, and they're out of this world — house-made the traditional way with locally-grown organic flour and wild yeast, deliciously hefty, and available in eight flavors slathered generously with goat cheese — and they still offer fresh-baked breads like the flagship ""West Side Sourdough"", multigrain, deli rye and Danish-style ''rugbrød'', as well as soft pretzels, pastry, and homemade granola. But with the new location has come an expanded concept, and at lunchtime BreadHive serves a slate of delicious sandwiches all named for the owners' favorite female musicians — favorites include ""The Robyn"" (basically a Reuben, except with pastrami in place of corned beef; the beet caraway sauerkraut is sourced from the West Side's own '''Barrel + Brine''') and ""The Bjork"" (a vegan-friendly concoction with tempeh ""bacon"" that really intrigued the reviewer in a recent edition of ''Buffalo Rising''). A somewhat smaller range of breakfast sandwiches are available in the morning as well, with locally-produced '''Public Coffee''' to wash them down. All these goodies are served to you either in a brightly-colored, well-lit dining room (the decor was described in a ''New York Times'' feature as ""psychedelic country house by way of Bushwick"" and by owner Emily Stewart herself as ""upscale '''Cracker Barrel'''"") where you can chill out to the strains of the latest indie music, or else on a small sidewalk patio perfect for people-watching.",USA
New York,eat,Custard Corner,"Once upon a time, hot dogs at '''Ted's''' followed by delicious soft-serve at Custard Corner was the classic West Side waterfront double-shot. Though Ted's Porter Avenue location closed in the '90s, its counterpart still hops during the summer months — and as if to make up for the loss of Ted's, Custard Corner's menu has expanded to include hot dogs, burgers, fries, chicken fingers, and other summery fare, including a decent range of salads. That's all well and good, but the standout here remains the changing selection of hard and soft '''Perry's''' ice cream (try the sponge candy flavor for a true taste of Buffalo!) that comes in cones, sundaes, or as part of an ""Arctic Swirl"" — their knockoff version of '''Dairy Queen''''s ""Blizzard"". Milkshakes, Italian ices, and frozen yogurt are also offered. There's nothing better on a summer day in Buffalo than relaxing here with a sweet treat on an umbrella-shaded picnic bench and taking in the pleasant view across the street to '''Prospect Park'''.",USA
New York,drink,Essex Street Pub,"Five Points' favorite hipster watering hole, now serving a full menu of pub grub. Barbeque is the specialty of the house at the Essex Street Pub: Texas- and Memphis-style platters of brisket, pulled pork and ribs served with cornbread, coleslaw, baked beans, or mac & cheese draw Buffalonians from far and wide. The meat is smoked in-house — slowly over hickory, the old-fashioned way — and they even make their own pastrami and corned beef (try their ""PLT"" which replaces bacon with delicious homemade pastrami). Elsewhere on the menu, diners can choose from a range of burgers and sandwiches, salads, as well as ample portions of ""snackatizers"" featuring some of the finest BBQ wings Buffalo has to offer, with just the right amount of sauce to accentuate but not overwhelm the smoky flavor of the chicken. Downsides include the service, which can be slow and gruff; also, no one would call this place the most comfortable in the world (seating is at the bar on high stools, or at one of the few wobbly tables if they're free).",USA
New York,eat,La Flor Bakery & Restaurant,"Generous portions of delicious Puerto Rican specialties served up for a pittance in a genial, family-oriented atmosphere: that's the name of the game at La Flor. This combination restaurant/bakery boasts a menu that's small, but packs in a respectable range of tropical fare. Those in search of a light lunch or a quick snack can enjoy sandwiches that range from familiar standards like turkey and ham and cheese to Hispano-Caribbean selections such as their excellent Cubano, as well as deep-fried classics like ''alcapurrias'' (described by many as the best in Buffalo), ''tostones'', and ''yuca al ajillo''. On the other side of the spectrum, heartier entrees — ''pollo guisado'', ''pollo frito'', ''pernil'', and the daily specials that make up the true heart and soul of La Flor's delicious cuisine — are served with heaping sides of yellow rice and beans. No matter what you order here, you can be sure that it's absolutely delicious and served with a smile. Wash it all down with a cold bottle of malta or kola champagne, and don't forget to take home some of the delectable tropical desserts available in the bakery: ''bizcocho'', several varieties of flan, ''pastelillos'', and on and on.",USA
New York,eat,Lait Cru Brasserie,"When local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz closed the doors of his namesake fine dining destination, '''Martin Cooks''', to embark on his next culinary adventure, '''Horsefeathers Market''' was left with a big expanse of space to fill — much bigger than its next tenant, '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile''', was accustomed to. What to do with the excess? Owner Jill Gedra-Forster had done a brisk business selling sandwiches and other light snacks at the old location on Elmwood Avenue, so the natural answer was to expand her operations into a full-fledged restaurant. Thus — with Will Peterson, former head chef of '''The Black Sheep''', the upscale foodie haven a little further down Connecticut Street that's co-owned by Gedra-Forster's sister, on board — was born Lait Cru Brasserie in August 2016. The fine domestic and imported cheeses Nickel City Cheese still sells the next stall over figure prominently into the gourmet breakfast and lunch fare served at Lait Cru (try the cheese plate if you want to go this route: it comes with a changing selection of three cheeses plus crunchy fried fava beans, wine-poached apricots, and — optionally — luxurious, 600-day aged prosciutto), but this place is no one-trick pony: a range of other locally-sourced goodies from Buffalo-area urban farms like '''Groundwork Market Garden''' and artisanal producers like the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''' are amply employed in the selection of sandwiches and other fare. Whether it's the ever-popular ""Nic Mac"" sandwich (house-roasted beef with crunchy sweet pickles and a tangy special sauce) that's caught your eye, or the house-cured salmon on German-style ''vollkornbrot'', or perhaps a selection from the all-day breakfast menu (standard egg, cheese, and meat concoctions enhanced with gourmet ingredients and well-thought-out presentations), you can be assured of fresh, well-balanced flavors, with full advantage taken of seasonal produce. Portions are on the small side and prices are on the high side, but — it bears repeating again — the quality of the ingredients justifies that. You can dine at one of the half-dozen or so tables scattered sparsely across the hardwood floor, but most people seem to opt for a seat at the long, low bar that's a holdover from the Martin Cooks days, where you have a great view of the open kitchen. Dinner hours are forthcoming, so it's claimed, as is a liquor license.",USA
New York,eat,Michelle's Caribbean Cuisine,"Occupying the space in the rear of '''Horsefeathers Market''' that was previously home to '''Blackbird Sweets''', this family-owned eatery is open five days a week for lunch and on Fridays and Saturdays also for dinner, when an expanded menu is on offer. Michelle's is distinct from most of Buffalo's other Caribbean restaurants in that the food they serve is not Jamaican in provenance but comes from Trinidad and Tobago, a country where classic Caribbean flavors are tempered by a diversity of culinary influences including Hispanic, African, Indian, and even Chinese. Accordingly, head chef Marlene Bernard's menu accommodates everything from well-known favorites like oxtail and escoveitch fish, to Trinidadian particularities such as ""doubles"" (a sandwich of fried flatbread stuffed with curried chickpeas) and ''dhalpuri roti'', to full-blown fusion dishes like ''pelau'' salad (which bears a resemblance to both the South Asian rice dish ''pulao'' and the ''jambalaya'' of Louisiana Creole cuisine) and ""Caribbean Chinese"" chicken, lightly breaded and served over fried rice and mixed vegetables — the folks at Michelle's call it ""morish"" food, because as soon as you finish what's on your plate, you want more. All this goodness is served up with a heaping side of laid-back island hospitality, as friendly as can be.",USA
New York,eat,Niagara Café,"Located on Niagara Street, the main thoroughfare of Buffalo's West Side Latino community, the Niagara Café has been recognized by ''Artvoice'' as Buffalo's best Puerto Rican restaurant. Latin American specialties like ''pastelillos'', ''alcapurrias'', ''pollo guisado'', and rice and beans are all available here in a friendly environment for prices that cannot be beat. This place has won multiple awards at the Taste of Buffalo. More than its food, however, the Niagara Café is about Puerto Rican cultural pride and community identity.",USA
New York,eat,Press,"A business defined by an ethos of ethics, sustainability, and health-consciousness, Press opened its doors in the Lower West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''', graduated to a stand-alone location on Grant Street in 2013, and most recently, in 2016, has landed in an even larger space in Five Points. The flagship product here is a range of organic juices that are all cold-pressed onsite (a method of extraction that preserves three times as many nutrients as others) and offered either on a made-to-order basis or packaged in returnable glass bottles so as to reduce plastic waste. As well, delicious smoothies, organic energy shots and drinks, and cold-filtered coffee are sold. Those who've arrived for lunch can enjoy an all-new, chainging selection of daily salad and sandwich specials — all organic, locally-sourced, vegan, and GMO-free — as well as vegan breakfast in the morning. Executive Chef Esther Pica is happy to work with customers to accommodate any dietary needs or preferences they may have, and all ingredients for each item are helpfully listed on the menu. As well, all utensils are biodegradable or reusable. Local consensus is this food is pricey but worth it.",USA
New York,eat,Sazón Criollo,"This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side is all business, dishing out Puerto Rican specialties among a spartan decor — this place's food is so good that they don't need to distract you with fancy-shmancy bells and whistles. ""I think the operative word to describe Sazón Criollo best may be 'simple'"", says one reviewer, but an equally good word might be ""authentic"" — unlike the '''Niagara Café''', Buffalonians at large haven't yet discovered this place, and with a customer base that's almost entirely Spanish-speaking and Latino, Sazón Crillo couldn't afford to serve anything less than the real deal. Step inside and place your order at the counter (most likely with one of the extremely friendly husband-and-wife team who owns the place), then take your seat from among the half-dozen or so tables in the small dining room, and when the time comes, dig in to a whole slew of Hispano-Caribbean selections, from well-known favorites like ''alcapurrias'', ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil'' to delicacies that are harder to find in Buffalo, like stewed ''mofongo'' served with a variety of meat toppings, as well as an awesome ''tripleta'' sandwich offered at lunchtime — a messy, meaty trifecta of ham, ''pernil'', and whole sautéed chicken breasts smothered with melted cheese, ketchup and mayonnaise and served on toasted panini. Daily specials are also offered which include a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes on Fridays, including ''bacalao guisado'' and a delectable seafood salad. The service at Sazón Criollo is brusque but efficient, and the prices can't be beat.",USA
New York,eat,Niagara Seafood,"Niagara Seafood began its life as a seafood shop owned by Michael Nguyen — who also owns '''Á Châu International Market''' next door — and was later converted to a restaurant, a gradual process that ended in 2014 when the last frozen seafood coolers and grocery displays were taken out of the dining room. A few Burmese and Thai dishes are to be had here, but the main attraction at Niagara Seafood is Vietnamese cuisine, with an accent, not surprisingly, on seafood. Steamed mussels, crab, shrimp, clams, oysters, crawfish, and even whole lobsters are the backbone of the menu, along with fried appetizers, fish sandwiches, and even a fairly faithful interpretation of Buffalo-style fish fry — its only major departure from local tradition is that catfish, lake perch and tilapia are offered as well as the usual haddock. The menu also boasts a number of non-seafood mains, but most of them are not as good; it's especially advisable to stay away from the chicken curry, which contains more bone than meat (those little bones that are hard to eat around, no less). Worthy of special mention is the ''pho'': in contrast with the ample selection of permutations available at '''Pho 99''', there's only one variety available at Niagara Seafood — ''pho bo gan'', with tendons and beef meatballs (thinly sliced filet mignon can be added for a $2 upcharge) — but it's among the most authentic you'll find in Buffalo. Sadly, the flavor and freshness of the broth leave much to be desired, but the same is not true of the ''banh mi'' available as appetizers, which were good enough to win Niagara Seafood the award for Best Sandwich in 2013's ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' poll in ''Artvoice''. Though portion sizes are generous, the food tends to be a bit pricey, so beware.",USA
New York,eat,The Black Sheep,"In 2014, '''Bistro Europa''' joined the growing legion of businesses leaving the popular but high-rent Elmwood Village for the newly trendy West Side: owners Steve and Ellen Gedra set up shop in August of that year at the former '''Golden Key Tavern''' on Connecticut Street with a new name and a slightly revised concept. The newly rechristened Black Sheep builds on the pan-European eclecticism of its former iteration with a menu that, while not much longer than Bistro Europa's, is even more wide-ranging and upscale than before (with prices to match). This expansion is a reflection of the expansion of its staff, kitchen facilities, and above all, dining room: The Black Sheep seats about 70 people, more than double the old place, and the capacity is expanded further in the summer months thanks to a large, pleasant rear patio. As always, the accent here is on locally-sourced produce, meat, poultry, and dairy products, which figure into the smoked pork chop entree that comes with a side of heirloom grits and braised greens. As for appetizers, the cheese and charcuterie plates that were so popular at Europa are still on hand (courtesy of Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile'''), along with new innovations such as a sweet-and-savory watermelon gazpacho that comes with kaffir lime granita. You can also enjoy a selection of beers curated by '''Community Beer Works''' at a bar made of wood salvaged during the thorough restoration process that preceded the Black Sheep's opening.",USA
New York,eat,Left Bank,"Left Bank has been the cornerstone of the Five Points dining scene since its opening in 1992. Despite its name and the local misconception, the menu here goes far beyond French food, instead encompassing an eclectic sampling of Continental, Italian, and New American dishes — in fact, Left Bank was one of the first restaurants in the city to embrace upscale cuisine of that kind, hence its enduring reputation as one of Buffalo's most celebrated fine dining destinations. As well, the menu has remained remarkably static over that time — some locals even call it ""dated"" — but when you serve food this consistently good, why fix what's not broken? With portions that are big especially for a fine-dining establishment like this, the menu consists of a modest but high-quality range of appetizers and salads, a selection of small plates divided into rustic ""peasant fare"" (featuring the best fried calamari in the city) and more upscale ""bourgeois fare"" (the ahi tuna tartare is a particular standout), and a slate of creative and artful main courses of steak and chops, seafood dishes such as an out-of-this-world carrot papardelle tossed in a shellfish brandy cream with lobster, shrimp and crab, and a range of pasta dishes including a delightful chicken linguine with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. Left Bank also offers a changing selection of daily specials, as well as a wine list of encyclopedic proportions and impeccable quality; those who'd prefer to eat light have several delicious focaccia sandwiches to choose from. All this is served in a chic, intimate ambience that's been described as ""arty meets industrial meets pub"". It bears emphasizing that this is a small place where reservations are ''de rigueur'' and it gets uncomfortably loud when crowded, so if it's warm, opt for the pleasant, gardenlike patio in back. Service can be slow, but it's always friendly; anyway, this is the kind of place where you want to linger. Off-street parking is available — a rarity in this part of town.",USA
New York,eat,Providence Social,"The September 2013 opening of this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' and most recently occupied by '''Prime 490''' steakhouse, was decidedly quiet. But Providence Social is the real deal. At the helm is chef/owner Josh Hanzlian, whose local credibility is beyond reproach: his stepfather is the late, great Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Martin, and another branch of his family owns '''Hanzlian's Homemade Sausage''' in Pine Hill. Hanzlian describes the cuisine served at Providence Social as a ""new American fusion"" where the focus is on tapas and small plates (though a small range of full-size mains is also available), and in a recent write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'' said he ""want[s] this [restaurant] to be a social experience"", hence its name. The food here consists of tried-and-true favorites with creative twists: nachos are topped with duck confit and lime-infused crème fraîche, sliders are made with ground lamb and boast a salsa of cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds, and the stuffed poblano peppers — arguably the most popular item on the menu — are filled with a mélange of aged cheeses and stone-cut oats, crusted with an olive panko breading, and served at dinner with a red pepper chipotle cream sauce and at brunch on Sundays with a side of eggs and toast. Indeed, reviewers reserve special praise for the Sunday brunch here, with $1 mimosas on offer. Appropriately enough for the place that was once the scene of a Mafia hit, the ambience at Providence Social is pure gangland-era Art Deco, right down to the stylized lettering on the huge neon sign. The speakeasy decor continues indoors, complete with chandeliers, for a package that one reviewer describes as ""rival[ing] '''Left Bank''' in atmosphere both indoors and on the patio"" — yet it's refreshingly less crowded (for now) than that nearby hotspot. Service is friendly and attentive.",USA
New York,eat,Horsefeathers Winter Market,"Every Saturday morning during the winter months, the ground floor of '''Horsefeathers Market''' is transformed into a winter farmers' market where over twenty farmers and vendors from all across Western New York sell fresh produce and locally crafted artisanal food products — cookies, jams and jellies, even organic dog treats and local wine. Visitors can enjoy performances by local musicians as they browse the market stands, or enjoy a bite to eat after shopping at permanent Horsefeathers tenants like '''Michelle's Caribbean Cuisine'''.",USA
New York,eat,Angie's Pizza House,"One of the best-kept secrets in Black Rock, Angie's Pizza House is a friendly neighborhood hole-in-the-wall that dishes out cheap, delicious pizza and homestyle Italian fare in a handsome old brick block on Niagara Street. In the words of one reviewer, ""like the City of No Illusions [itself], there's no pretense here""; rather, its dated, spartan decor combines with friendly service to create true humble, homespun charm. The titular focus of the menu has a crust that's a good deal thinner than classic Buffalo-style pizza (though not foldable like New York pizza), and the pepperoni are the large, thinly-sliced kind you don't see too often here, but the sauce has the same sweetness you'll find elsewhere in the area. Pizza is only the beginning of the story at Angie's, though: the regulars rave about simple but reliable Italian favorites like ravioli, eggplant parm, and (especially) spaghetti with homemade meatballs and red sauce, and there are also hot and cold subs, more elaborate fare like steaks and chops, and a surprisingly competent chicken souvlaki entree. Hearty breakfasts are served weekdays, and Friday fish fry packs the house. Cash only.",USA
New York,eat,Emily's,"Open for breakfast, lunch and (except Sunday) dinner, Emily's could be accurately described as a classic blue-collar Buffalo Greek diner, but that would be selling the place a bit short: for one, a small slate of Lebanese specialties including ''kofta'' over rice and homemade ''labneh'' are now served; and also, the food served here is a cut above what you'd expect from a humble place like this. This is a mom-and-pop place in the most literal sense of the term: Sam, the friendly, personable owner/chef who's frequently seen chatting up the regulars in the dining room, is joined on Emily's staff by his wife Jocelyn, the sole waitress whose service is second to none. In a delightfully dated ambience is served a host of hearty, homestyle American fare like meatloaf, liver and onions, and porkchops; sandwiches, burgers, and wraps (including that old-school Buffalo standby, fried bologna); and — of course — all your favorite Greek diner standards such as souvlaki and gyro, served either ""open"" or as full-size entrees with a side of potatoes prepared how you like them. Souvlaki permutations also populate the breakfast menu, which otherwise consists of hearty egg-and-sausage fare as well as delicious homemade pancakes. All the food is delicious, homemade, and served with old-fashioned aplomb. A public lot is conveniently located across the street as an alternative to parallel parking on Hertel Avenue.",USA
New York,eat,George's American Diner,"No surprises at this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014. There are a few token concessions to local particularities — Texas hots available alongside regular hot dogs; souvlaki chicken and feta cheese among the ingredient selections in the ""build-your-own"" omelette — but by and large, George's sticks to the tried-and-true formula of classic American diner fare and does so with aplomb. The burgers, sandwiches, and copious breakfast options are reliably good and available at great prices. Service is efficient, the interior is sparkling clean and decorated in a pleasant if spartan aesthetic — one online review of this place included the sentence ""If an alien visited Earth and asked 'what's a diner?' this is exactly where I would take them"", and that's about as accurate and succinct a review of George's as you'll ever find.",USA
New York,eat,Riverside Café,"Riverside Café is a friendly, homey greasy spoon (actually, that's probably not the right term to use — this place is spic and span!) in the heart of the neighborhood of the same name, serving breakfast and lunch daily with several changing specials available each day. ""Local"" is the operative word here — Riverside Café's lunch menu features a rogue's gallery of Buffalo specialties like beef on weck, Texas hots, and fried bologna sandwiches made with locally-produced '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters, '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and '''Costanzo's''' rolls. Sandwiches are king at lunchtime — the slate of single- and double-decker concoctions include a delectable Monte Cristo made with either turkey or corned beef — and some interesting burgers are available too, all made with 100% Angus beef patties; these include a ""Buffalo-style burger"" (topped with a mix of blue cheese dressing and '''Frank's''' hot sauce) and a doughnut burger (exactly what it sounds like: a glazed doughnut replaces the bun). A decent selection of homemade soups are also available to go with. But Riverside Café may be even more popular at breakfast, with a gargantuan menu that ranges from the usual permutations of the eggs-toast-sausage-bacon template to more specialized dishes like a pepperoni and salsa omelette and flaky homemade biscuits topped with sausage gravy. Additionally, the Riverside Café is open into dinnertime on Fridays and Saturdays, when locals pack the house to enjoy delicious fish fry — another local favorite. Service here earns mixed reviews; it's quick and efficient but sometimes not so friendly.",USA
New York,eat,Acqua,"In 2015, Acqua changed the game: that's when the waterfront eatery at the former site of '''Harry's Harbour Place'''  launched a new ""casual menu"", boasting lower prices and a more laid-back atmosphere to go with the breathtaking views over the Niagara River. Seafood rules the day among Acqua's main courses — not surprisingly — but the appetizer menu adds interesting Asian influences to the mix, including an interesting noodle bowl with shredded chicken and peanut sesame sauce.",USA
New York,eat,Buffalo Supper Club,"Buffalo Supper Club's owners, Aaron Osborne and Christopher Williams, started with a vision: what if the Black Rock dining scene were more than just pizzerias, fast-food joints and greasy spoons? What if, instead, you could come to the uppermost reaches of the West Side for a real night on the town, with fine dining at a stylish, upscale sit-down restaurant? Flash forward to October 2014, when the Buffalo Supper Club opened its doors on Niagara Street. The owners promised that ""when you walk in here, you won't think you're in Black Rock; you'll think you're somewhere on Delaware or Elmwood"", and despite its unassuming look from the outside, all is as promised — the dining room makes up for in style and snazz what it lakes in size, with a sleek, minimalist decor, all-black furniture (including a comfy ''chaise longue''!), an electric fireplace, a vintage-style jukebox, and a lively bar serving up a mix of big-name domestic and imported beers as well as local craft brews. Best of all, without skimping on quality, the Buffalo Supper Club's food comes at prices that won't break the bank: nothing on the menu costs more than $30. The food here scores few points for creativity; instead, it offers well-executed takes on familiar favorites such as steak, a range of chicken and seafood mains, classic Buffalo-style fish fry, burgers (the ""Supper Club Blues Burger"", featuring one beef and one chicken patty topped with bacon, American and crumbly blue cheese is a particularly interesting option), and on the appetizers menu, chicken wings that come in Buffalo style, barbeque or your choice of specialty sauces.",USA
New York,eat,Faso's,"A surprise is in store for hungry Black Rockers who peruse Faso's unassuming, shopworn exterior and expect yet another round of uninspired red-sauce Italian. It's true that this is a small family operation located in a blue-collar neighborhood, and from the prices on the menu you wouldn't think you're in for anything remarkable. But Faso's is run by a real Italian — ""actually from Italy, not an nth generation [Italian-American who doesn't] know any Italian except throwing 'paisan' into conversation"", says one reviewer — whose authentic food boasts nuanced flavors and textures not typical of Americanized Italian food. Start by walking into a dining room that's much larger than it looks from the outside and doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be highbrow or lowbrow — delightfully tawdry decorative elements like colored Christmas lights (up all year), dangly baubles, framed portraits of the Rat Pack, and plaster Virgin Mary sculptures coexist with low lighting and soft Italian music on the speakers. Then, while munching on the most heavenly bread knots that have ever melted in your mouth, peruse menu options that range from well-known standards to more obscure dishes that are hard to find in these parts; this ""food so good you'll think we stole your mama"" is light, healthful, and prepared with fresh ingredients. Faso's pasta is scratch-made in house, the ""best seafood menu on the Buffalo Harbor"" includes shrimp fra' diavolo, swordfish steak Italiano, and scallops cooked any way you like, fine steaks and chops abound, and sandwiches and the like are on offer for those who want portions smaller than the heaping ones you otherwise get. Service is uncommonly warm and friendly — the owner is known for greeting customers personally with an impeccable, old-world tableside manner — but can be slow if the place is crowded.",USA
New York,eat,Lin Restaurant,"Yet another addition to the roster of options on the West Side for fans of Burmese cuisine, this place is run by the same folks who operate '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street (and, in tandem with the December 2014 opening of the restaurant, they also inaugurated a second grocery store location next door). In reality, Thai dishes comprise more than half of the options on Lin Restaurant's menu: mostly the standard lineup of curries, fried rice, and noodle dishes available with chicken, beef, pork, or seafood, but with a few surprises mixed in if you look. However, it's in the Burmese options where Lin's cooks really strut their stuff in terms of creativity and authenticity: savory ''samosas'' are the star of the show in the appetizers department, ''le peth thoat'' tea leaf salad is present in a version that rivals the one at '''Sun''', and ''mohinga'' is made the authentic Burmese way. Copious options are available for vegans and the gluten-free crowd, but those who like spicy food might not be quite satisfied with the preparation here (for best results, have them make your food ""Thai hot""). Service is friendly as can be and carefully walks the line between attentive and annoyingly obtrusive, and the pleasant if minimalist decor looks as if a spartan selection of Asian restaurant accoutrements (silver elephant engravings and the like) were grafted onto the template of a homestyle country diner, with walls painted pink and covered with charming wainscoting around the bottom.",USA
New York,eat,Sun,"The Buffalo dining scene has come a long way since 2010, when Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur, felt compelled to lump the delicious specialties of his native Myanmar under the ""Vietnamese"" section of his restaurant's menu because he was unsure how locals would take to this unfamiliar new cuisine. He needn't have worried — Buffalonians practically beat down the door at Sun, and even if this place can't hold a candle to the West Side Bazaar's '''Kyel Sein Hein''' in terms of authenticity, it's still the only game in town if you want a full menu of Burmese food served in an actual, full-service restaurant setting. The ""full menu"" part bears repeating — the range of offerings at Sun is gargantuan, with a menu broken down into Burmese (labeled as such), Thai, and Asian fusion sections featuring tantalizing appetizers and salads, curries, rice and noodle dishes, and soups. Diners also love Sun's ""black rice menu"", a range of sushi rolls, salads and desserts prepared using a rare and nutritious variety of rice once reserved for the elites of the Chinese imperial court — and although in this author's opinion it's way overhyped, locals rave about the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') which is Sun's specialty. For newbies, the helpful waitstaff are always happy to walk you through the menu, explaining each dish in detail. On the minus side, Sun's food is pricey especially when you consider the unimpressive size of their portions, and service is often slow especially when it's crowded.",USA
New York,eat,Viking Lobster Company,"The Viking Lobster Company is a classic case of ""don't judge a book by its cover"": hidden inside a somewhat shabby-looking building that could pass for one of the houses on the side street next to it is arguably the finest restaurant in Black Rock. The menu here is modest in size, but covers all the bases for seafood lovers — shrimp, scallops, broiled salmon and haddock filets, king crab legs, and, of course, myriad permutations of lobster — and also makes room for a few interesting innovations, such as steak-stuffed lobster and a creative take on paella. Prices may seem high at first glance, but it's justified by the impeccable quality of the food — it's shipped directly from processors on the North Atlantic coast for maximum freshness, and Viking also has the largest live-lobster holding pens in Upstate New York. For those who don't like seafood, a modest range of steaks, ribs, and roasted chicken dishes are served; these also tend to be lower in price than the rest of the menu. Sides such as soups, salads and bread are all prepared daily in-house. At Viking, service is friendly and attentive, the vibe is relaxed, portion sizes are ample, and the interior is cool without trying to be — pretense is eschewed in favor of what one reviewer describes as a ""quirky at-the-wharf kind of feel"". In summer, the patio (which features a raw bar and outdoor grill) is the place to be. Reservations are required. Cash only, but there's an ATM onsite.",USA

New York,other,Assumption RC Church,"With the completion of the New York Central Railroad's Belt Line in 1883, the eastern outskirts of Black Rock began to develop into Buffalo's second Polish neighborhood — a sort of little brother to Broadway-Fillmore — and Assumption Church, headed at the outset by the Rev. Theophil Kozlowski, was its nucleus.

The addition in 1874 of the transept, sanctuary, and choir completed the building to its present appearance. Holy Angels has been a West Side anchor in the midst of the myriad changes that have taken place since then — neighborhood demographics have shifted from Irish to Italian to Hispanic (one Spanish-language Mass is still said every Sunday) to a multicultural pastiche, and the building is now an island in the middle of the greatly expanded '''D'Youville College''' — but the friendly and welcoming church community, 1,400 families strong, soldiers on.",USA
New York,other,Holy Cross RC Church,"Holy Cross was founded in tandem with the growth of the Italian community in its surrounding neighborhood, and has managed to remain a vital cornerstone of the Lower West Side despite the great changes that have taken place there over the century of its existence. Holy Cross today is a congregation that is vibrant and multicultural, but largely Hispanic, and Mass is said in both languages. True to the Italian tradition, the interior of the church is bedecked with scores of statues of the Madonna, many of which were brought over by the original parishioners from the old country.",USA

New York,other,First United Methodist Church,"As its name indicates, First United Methodist is the oldest congregation of its denomination in Buffalo, and one of the oldest, period — it was founded in 1819 in what was then the Village of Black Rock by the Reverend Glezen Fillmore, an itinerant frontier preacher who, besides being a cousin of President Millard Fillmore, was New York State's first Methodist minister west of the Genesee River. They moved to their current location in 1912, where Pastor Scott Lamont Johnson continues to lead weekly services for a small but vibrant and welcoming flock. If nothing else, the building itself is reason enough to come: it's a handsome English Gothic design in rough-cut limestone that's the work of architect John Coxhead, with an austere but lovely skylit interior.",USA

Built by Mameluke Sultan Abdul-Nasser Qa'it Bay in 1477 AD but razed and reconstructed twice since.This citadel was built in 1480 by Sultan Qaitbay on the site of the Pharos Lighthouse, to protect the city from the crusaders who used to attack the city by sea. The Citadel is situated at the entrance of the eastern harbor on the eastern point of the Pharos Island. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria. The lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several disasters occurred and the shape of lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it still continued to function. During the 11thcentury an earthquake destroyed the top of the lighthouse and the bottom was used as a watchtower. A small Mosque was built on the top. About 1480 A.D the place was fortified as part of the coastal defensive edifices. Later castle looking citadel was built as a prison for princes and state-man. Now it’s a Maritime Museum.",Egypt

The underground tunnels of the catacombs lie in the densely populated district of Karmouz to the east of Alexandria. The catacombs were most probably used as a private tomb, for a single wealthy family, and later converted to a public cemetery. They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels for the funerary ritual and entombment.
