"This building is considered one of the highlights of Danish architecture, designed by the famous architects Arne Jacobsen and Erik Møller in cooperation with equally celebrated furniture designer Hans Wegner. Clad in grey Norwegian marble, it might appear bland to the untrained eye from the outside, but the indoor design is much more intriguing. Every Saturday from 10 to 11:30 guided tours are arranged around the interior of the building. For a fee, you can visit the clock tower and enjoy the view. There are several interesting statues around the town hall. Enjoy the dramatic bronze statue and fountain of ""Agnethe og Havmanden"" near the city entrance towards the Central Station. It depicts a scene from a Danish fairy tale about Agnethe who falls in love with a merman. From here you can walk through the city entrance and the Town Hall Park and observe more bronze statues and memorial stones. The park is quite lively in the summer, as people tend to flock here as soon as the Sun is out.

Next door you can try '''[http://www.oishiiwok.dk/ Oishii Wok]''', focusing on Chinese wok-style food. Both restaurants are operated by the same owner, and he also has two other oriental restaurants in Aarhus: '''Saichi''' (original Japanese restaurant in Jægergårdsgade) and '''Kung Fu Express''' (a sushi and Chinese wok take-away in Højbjerg)."
"The Diner is an all-American diner started by two friends in 2011. They travelled the US to find original secondhand utensils and both the interior design and the food is in the real American style, focussed on the 50's. At The Diner you can get American breakfast, brunch, sandwiches, burger and fries, beer and refreshments or just a piece of pie and coffee if you like. If you are from or have been to the USA, you probably know more authentic places, but the food at The Diner is quite good and the burgers are among the best in Aarhus, something that is not easily achieved. In the last few years, Aarhus has experienced a veritable ""burger war"", with good quality burger joints popping up everywhere, so there is strong competition. Some of the new quality burger spots include '''[http://www.murphysburger.dk/intro-1 Murphy's Burger Joint]''', '''[http://theburgerjoint.dk/ The Burger Joint]''', '''[http://grillenburgerbar.dk/ Grillen Burgerbar]''', '''[http://theburgershack.dk/ The Burger Shack]''', '''[http://wedoburgers.dk/ WeDoBurgers]''', '''[https://www.facebook.com/Burger-HUT-1603827333241894/ BurgerHut]''' and '''[http://www.tommisburgerjoint-aarhus.dk/ Tommi's Burger Joint]''', usually with organic or locally produced meat and homemade ingredients. Among the well-established burger joints in Aarhus, '''[http://byensburger.danbutikken.dk/ Byens Burger]''' is one of the very best spots, with catering all-night on the weekends. You can also get good gourmet burgers at many cafés, sliders at '''[http://rodizio.dk/ Rodizio]''' and of course the usual fare at McDonalds and Burger King. The Diner also has a spot in Viby, a southern district of Aarhus, and in the city of Vejle."
"At this place you can enjoy simple French inspired gourmet food for a mid-range price.

"At this place you can choose to eat your breakfast, brunch, lunch or evening dinner or just sit for a cup of tea or coffee and enjoy the athmosphere and fashionable [http://www.kahlerdesign.com/ Kähler] ceramics. The menu is diverse and of very good quality. Part of the menu is inspired by traditional Danish dishes, like the decorated open sandwhiches, but often with a twist. Also Nordic inspired gourmet cuisine. Quality breakfast at 80 DKK. Three course dinner for 298 DKK. Kähler also operates a luxurious high-end gourmet restaurant in a mansion in the northern neighbourhood of Risskov by the name '''[http://www.villadining.dk/kahler-villa-dining/?gclid=CNfX4pnhicoCFasBwwodO5oO6g Kähler villa dining]'''. Here you can experience excellent New Nordic Cuisine for mid-ranged prices."
"At this bistro and winebar you can get very good French-style food, both bistro and dinners. Casual and cheerful atmosphere, awarded for its ""feel-good experience"". If you like to have a peek before you decide, go have a coffee or perhaps a full brunch at the café next door by the name '''Kaffe 67'''. It would probably be a good idea to book ahead at the restaurant, as it is rather small and often full of people having a good time. Good opportunities for vegetarians. There is also an excellent seafood restaurant known as '''[http://www.klassiskfisk.dk Klassisk Fisk]''' run by the same group of people in Nørregade near the Latin Quarter. It is also French style and in the same price range. A la carte is more expensive at the seafood restaurant though and there are some splurge options too. Be aware that Klassisk Fisk does not take any cash."
"Restaurant ET is located at a less busy place at the river side. Here you can try a good variety of excellent quality dishes, inspired by French and Danish classic recipes like ''Confit de Canard'' and ''Chicken Danoise'', but with a fresh twist. Excellent choice of wines and cheese. Two types of three course evening dinners at DKK 358 (wine excluded), but you can also dine a la carte at DKK 150-250 for a main course.

With a flagship tapas menu at DKK 328 and matching wines for DKK 248, CANblau walks the line between mid-range priced and a splurge. It is possible to buy individual a-la-carte tapas at a lower price and still feel satisfied. A very large Spanish winecard, with several gems and special imports. There is also a CANblau in Aalborg."

"One of Aarhus' most exquisite gourmet restaurants, led by renowned chef Wassim Hallal and located in the Marselisborg Forest across Mindeparken. Awarded one star in the Michelin guide in 2015, in part because of its originality. Stylish modern decor."

"At Gastromé you can experience an inspired take on the New Nordic Cuisine at a very high level. Good local ingredients are used in abundance according to the seasons and many dishes have a strong reference to traditional classical Danish dishes, but they also serve caviar here and use ingredients like chocolate or rum and do not limit themselves by the strict dogmas of true New Nordic. The chefs calls it a ""gourmet-inspired country kitchen"". Gastromé is one of the best restaurants in Aarhus, opened at the beginning of 2015 and awarded a Michelin-star right after. The two restaurateurs and chefs here are quite experienced though, as they have been operating a somewhat similar restaurant at the historic Vilhelmsborg manor just south of Aarhus for many years, by the name of '''[http://detgamlemejeri.dk/ Det Gamle Mejeri]''' (the old dairy). Here you can also get an excellent Sunday brunch."
"Aarhus branch of the lauded Danish steak house, boasting some of the city's best steaks as well as a very impressive wine menu. Also fish and quality burgers. Lunch option Mon-Fri."

The menus are 3, 5 or 9 courses with a three-course dinner at DKK 499, and pairing wines for DKK 349; this is not a mid-range place. Every second month, both the menus and the interior design are changed."
"At L'estragon you can get superb French-style gourmet food. The restaurant is very small and can only seat 22 guests at a time, so reservations would be a good idea. As L'estragon is not the only exclusive gastronomic spot in Aarhus, it qualifies for special mention because it also holds a gold certificate in organic food and a large part of the excellent wine card is either organic or biodynamic wines.The food products are often choosen from local farmers. The main criteria for L'estragons selections are always taste and quality above all though. 3-4-5-6 course dinners."
"Here you can try out some local experimental gourmet cooking. With a focus on organic food and a firm anchor in local ingredients, the chefs at this place cooks up ever changing dishes at a fixed price. You will never know what dishes they have in mind for you, as they will make the best of what is in season, available and of a good quality, but you can be sure it will be prepared well and done creatively. This is part of the charm and deconstructed concept of Hærværk. The wines are organic or biodynamic and you can also try [http://www.morethanorganic.com/ natural wines] here, the new hip thing in the world of wines and environmental awareness. Hærværk is a relatively new place, run by four friends, three of which are chefs. Do not be fooled by the anonymous facade and ordinary adress."
"Domestic is a new star on the restaurant scene in Aarhus. Along with Hærværk, Domestic is among the first attempts in the city to present a truly dedicated locavore dining experience in the New Nordic tradition. Recently opened in the premises of several former celebrated restaurants in a strange backyard in Mejlgade, Restaurant Domestic has already received a number of recommendations from food critics in both Denmark and abroad. Founded by experienced chefs and waiters, the culinary experience here is not cheap, but bound to be different, inspiring, local and of a high standard.

"With a central location next to Aarhus Theatre, this historic restaurant has served food since 1911. The name Teater Bodega is from 1959. There is a big variety in the meal plan, and the quality is good. The interior is kept in an old traditional Danish design and is an experience in itself."
"With an old fashioned decor, this place has a varied menu for both lunch and dinner. Authentic traditional dishes, with large filling portions of a great quality. Good value for the money. Special traditional Danish lunch buffet on Saturdays. Try a ''snaps'' (Danish bitter) with your open sandwhich here. A good informal vibe."
"Right around the corner from Pinden is the small gastro-pub of Europa. For lunch and dinner they serve traditional Danish-style cuisine of a good quality. Good beer selection, many from draft and also homemade ''snaps''. Red wine is also served, but beer is the best companion to traditional Danish food. This place is worth visiting just to enjoy one of their good draft beers, you are not required to dine."
"Located in the former slaughter house district of the harbour, this restaurant (from 1907) serves good quality traditional Danish meals. The restaurant is very popular for loud dinner parties and it might be impossible to reserve a seat."
"Centrally located near the Latin quarter, but at a less busy corner of the inner city, this restaurant serves traditional Danish food of a good quality and variety for both lunch and evening dinners. Portions are large. ''Den Lille Kro'' (The Little Inn) is not too big, with a cosy atmosphere, and has been popular since its opening some years ago. It was closed for about a month in 2016 due to a change of director and owner."
"In this deli and take away, you can try a good selection of Danish open sandwiches. The prices are fair, at DKK 33 - 48 for ''smørrebrød'' (traditional open face sandwich on rye) and just DKK 12 for a ''håndmad''. Good option for picnics."
"Vegan restaurant and café with focus on sustainability. Good quality and variety. Everything is made from scratch."

"This excellent evening restaurant is located in a secluded backyard in the Latin Quarter.

You can also have non-alcoholic beverages with your food here if you like, including teas and homemade juices. Special 3-course Theatre menu at DKK 260 (drinks excluded) with early arrival at 17:30.

Other places selling vinyl record includes Badstuerock and Dandelion Records, both in the Latin Quarter, Route 66 in Fredensgade and Pladekisten in Jægergårdsgade."
"LYNfabrikken (The Lightning Factory) is an alternative office community for small creative businesses, and it also includes a café. Located in an old factory building in a backyard in Vestergade, it has a special aura of old and new and it can be an inspirational visit to have a peek at what is stirring in the creative entrepreneurial milieu of Aarhus. The café is located in the loft of the factory, equipped with a rooftop terrace. A good place to be in the summer for a quick change of scenery and a laid back secludedness in the midst of the bustling central city. The café offers beverages (good coffee), cakes and a small choice of food. It is spacious, well-lit and you can sit here to write, read, chat, relax or glance at books and crafts for sale. LYNfabrikken can be hard to spot, so you might have to investigate a few backyards in the vicinity before you locate it. This is not a bad thing, as you will surely make other interesting discoveries. There is a small exhibition room at the street near the backyard with changing arts and crafts."
"Comfortable old fashioned furnishing and a relaxed atmosphere. Tea, coffee, hot chocolate, cakes and sweet pies, breakfast plates, lunch and ice cream. Popular with groups of young mothers. Although Frederiksgade is packed with bars, restaurants and shopping opportunities, there aren't any other cafés in the immediate vicinity."
"Café in the day and nightclub on late weekend nights. Kakaobar is located at the railway yard at Godsbanen and serves sandwiches, salads and hot chocolate with various flavours along with other beverages. In the warmer seasons people play street basket, skate at the bowl or just hangs out around here."
"This place is a great getaway in beautiful nature, but close to the city. Situated in a former farmhouse, known as Norringholm, and administered by an architect couple, Constantia is actually a Bed & Breakfast, but with a sunday café attached. The café is open 10-17 and here you can order a large brunch menu (10-12) or a selection of various small dishes (10-16), ice cream, cakes and beverages. Great applejuice. The menu changes almost every Sunday, but you can check it out on their website. It would be a good idea to book a table beforehand, but Constantia is also open to random visitors if not fully booked. Combine a visit to Constantia with a nature walk or bicycle trip to the lake area. The house is located on the eastern shores of the Brabrand Lake, beyond an allotment area and with a magnificent view across the lake meadows. There is an outdoor chessboard, a sandbox for toddlers and climbing trees for adventurous kids. From Constantia you can take a longer trip around the lake along the ''Brabrandstien'' pathway or back to the city centre along the Aarhus River, also by the ''Brabrandstien'' pathway. Both trips are good nature experiences."
"Emmerys is a high-quality bakery, specialized in 100% organic food. It is a chain of bakeries with shops in Aarhus and Copenhagen, but it originated in Aarhus in 1918 as a pâtisserie (known as ''Konditori'' in Danish) in Guldsmedgade. There are six Emmerys in Aarhus, with four in the central parts. They all have a nice clean but cosy decor with seatings for dining and some small-talking. Good breakfast and brunch with a good selection of cakes and breads, but also high-end foodstuff like coffee, tea, pickles, marmalade, etc. The opening hours as well as the food for sale vary a little bit from shop to shop, but all are open every day of the week."
"Lagkagehuset offers breads and cakes of a high quality, but also cold confectioners cakes, including various layercakes and creamcakes, some of which are uniquely Danish. If you are looking for cakes specifically, Lagkagehuset has a broader selection than Emmerys. Lagkagehuset is also a Danish chain, but originating in Copenhagen and with only one café-shop in Aarhus. Open all days of week and with seating. Classy clean decor. Try a piece of the many kinds of Danish pastry or perhaps an Othello cake (chocolate cream layer cake of Danish origin) with your coffee or tea. In the summer of 2016, a new Lagkagehuset department opened in the northern neighbourhood of Risskov."
"A tasty bakery full of Danish delights - perfect for breakfast. Good sandwiches. It is a traditional bakery with only a couple of seats for eating. Excellent quality and delicious authentic Danish pastry of more than ten varieties. The range of choice for the cakes changes often.

"A large bakery with a drive-in. A broad selection of high quality baked goods, bread, buns, cakes, pastries, cream cakes, cookies, etc. Many traditional Danish cakes, including Danish pastries of course. You can stroll and take a good look at the variety on display. They also make high-end chocolate delights, including homemade ''flødeboller''. Nice clean decor with a section for eating. Coffee, tea, sandwhich and salads too. Large specially designed cakes for celebrations can be ordered. There are two other branches in Aarhus, one in Højbjerg and another in Risskov."
"At this small but great bakery you can watch the bakers at work and also buy quality coffee beans and champagne. They only use butter for baking here, no cheap substitutes, but the prices are very reasonable relative to the high quality. The shop is administered by a brother and a sister since 2006 and is located at the riverside, but at a less busy place."
"This is another small, quality bakery. Owned and run by a couple (both bakers), this place has a large variety of bread and cakes. The name ''Småkagehuset'' means ""The Cookie House"" and their broad and changing selection of cakes also includes cookies. Denmark has a long tradition for some unique cookies and is well-known for its export of butter cookies. At Småkagehuset you can pick and choose you own mix of Danish cookies, including ''vanillekranse'', ''jødekager'' and ''finsk brød'' but also other types, like the Italian-style biscotti. If you have a hard time choosing, just take your time or simply ask the bakers themselves about their baked goods, as they also works as sales clerks and are happy to chat and explain. As a specialty you can also buy sugar-free cakes here and baked goods certified for consumption by diabetics. There are a few chairs inside and a bench outside on the pavements."
"Fashionable cocktail bar in an old restored pharmacy from 1899. In the early evening this place is a high-end restaurant serving an international gourmet cuisine paired with cocktails as its specialty. Later in the evening it transforms to a nightclub. A large menu of superb cocktails served with great creativity, simply in its own league and candidating for the very best in town, if not the country. All cocktails can be made with reduced amounts of alcohol or alcohol free."
"Café in the late morning and afternoon, restaurant in the early evening and lounge bar in the night. Drinks, cocktails, wines by the glass, including champagne and sweet wines. Homemade lemonades and snacks."
"Perhaps the oldest surviving bar in Aarhus, since 1906. Nice decor, relaxed atmosphere, secluded corners and a backyard garden. A good selection of beers.

"One of several old fashioned bodegas on Frederiksbjerg. Televised football. Smoking allowed. Mixed crowd."
"Also on Frederiksbjerg, this bodega is popular with AGF football fans (AGF is the local club) before and after matches at the Ceres stadion. Historic place from 1944 and with an old fashioned ordinary decor. Smoking allowed. The bodega is situated at the end of the long Ingerslevs Boulevard, hence the name.

"While not precisely situated at the riverside, Cockney Pub is located just around the corner of Immervad in the small parallel alleyway of Sankt Clemens Stræde. Quite small, but very active place both in the daytime and in the nightlife, with an atmosphere that change accordingly. Cockney Pub was one of the pioneering spots to offer excellent quality craft beers, both from Denmark and around the world to the Aarhusians one or two decades ago and it is still among the best places in town for quality beers. Changing selection of draft beers, bottled beers, but also top-notch whiskeys and rums. Sometimes beer festivals, introducing noteworthy brews on tap from around the world. In-house jazz concerts on Sunday afternoons."
"With an anonymous entrance in a narrow side alley to the riverside promenade and in a basement, this place can be hard to spot for visitors. Drinks, beers and dancing, all for student friendly prices. The steep slope that houses this place is actually the remains of the old ramparts fortifying the original Viking town."
"Located at the river, this new hip place is only a few years old, but equipped as an iconic old fashioned bodega. You can find more details about Danish bodegas in a section below. Enjoy a beer and play some dart, a game of dice, carom (''bob'' in Danish) or some table football for a bit of fun.

"A large glass facade restaurant in two floors beneath the bridge. This places has housed several former venues, and in 2015 Clemens Gastro & Bar opened here. It is mostly a restaurant, but on weekends the bar referred to as Downstairs opens on the lower floor.

"Located under the Clemens Bro bridge, situated near four other very active nightclubs and a bit withdrawn from the riverside, this small place could easily be overlooked. Excellent cocktails, shots and drinks in a more relaxed atmosphere. Ever changing drink menu with new innovative cocktails, but the experienced bartenders here could most likely make any classic cocktail you would like."

Sleek fashionable design, creative cocktails and champagne by the bottle, Castenskiold has become something of a clubhouse for city's design and fashion elite."
"Zenza Cocktailbar’s main focus is high quality and good service. Here they offer a wide variety of delicious cocktails and various champagnes and spirits by the bottle. Try the signature ZenZa Exotic cocktail. ZenZa is more than ‘just’ a cocktail bar, and the party really gets started when the DJs puts on the music. There isn't much space for dancing here though.

Krull is a multitalented Danish artist with a zest for travelling and he has decorated every square inch of his small bar with strange wooden masks, artsy pictures and miscellaneous objects from around the world. Krull is a prominent artist in Denmark and you can enjoy some of his finer works by just looking at the three bronze statues next door at the casino or his large whole-wall mural in ''Fiskergade'' nearby of a woman kissing a sea gull. On most Sunday afternoons, [http://www.hanskrull.dk/ Krull] draws large portraits of people at this place, but it is a bit pricey. Be aware that smoking is allowed here. Happy hour every day from 17-21 and sometimes live music."
"A German style Beirstube with a large beer collection and Jägermeister. Kitschy but with tongue-in-cheek. Dance on the tables to some German Schlager if you fancy. Many young people (age limit is 20). You can find Heidi's Bier Bars in many other major cities in Denmark and Oslo also has one."

"Situated in one of Aarhus' oldest houses, Jacobs also includes a café, pita barbeque and a large restaurant, known for its top of the line beefsteaks. A separate piano bar at an open-air cobblestone atrium, with a small scene for occasional live music. Cosy and warm surroundings. Mixed audience."
"In a backyard of a beautifully restored yellow-black timber-framed merchant's house in Vestergade, Vestergade 58 has been a small popular music venue for 40 years. Also equipped with a bar and a separate scene used for stand-up comedy nights. Mostly up-and-coming performers for the comedy, with free admission. Brunch served on Sundays."
"Aarhus has plenty of opportunities to have some quality draft beer, but with more than twenty taps of different micro brews, Fermentoren probably offers the largest variety in town. The quality here is excellent and some of the beers are made by the bar itself. This beer bar also serves several bottled beers and some whiskeys and other spirits as well, so it shouldn't be a problem to find something of interest. The interior is cheap and retro with a dimmed candlelit lighting. Every time you buy a drink you get a free token if you will for a game on a retro arcade machine. No food is served here, but you can bring your own along if you buy a drink and are able to find a free table. Fermentoren started out in Copenhagen and have had this branch in Aarhus for some years now."
"A small but cozy pub in Irish style, not far from the main shopping street of ''Strøget''. Nice and friendly staff! Good selection of beers and whiskey. Sometimes televised major sports events. Live music on some Fridays and Saturdays."
"HeadQuarters is a cultural venue for theatre, dance and music but HQ also throws club and DJ nights with a broad appeal. Theme nights range from balkan music, indie and punk to soul and original disco. Have a beer or a drink here if you like, you do not have to participate in the event nights."
"Nightclub and event maker at the railway yard at Godsbanen. Double Rainbow hosts DJs on weekends and generally plays electronica, techno, house and disco that you wouldn't hear elsewhere in Aarhus. The club might look a bit small from the outside but has two dancefloors with room for up to 250 people and there are plenty of room for outdoor events when the weather permits. Outdoor events includes everything from raves to barbecue grill parties. Double Rainbow is also open during daytime all days of the week except Mondays and is then known as '''Kakaobar''', serving hot chocolate with various flavours and other beverages. At this time people play street basket, skate at the bowl or just hangs out."
"Gay leather and fetish bar."
"This place is a bodega on Trøjborg and is very active day and night. You can find more details about Danish bodegas in the section below. It is one of the few spots active in the nightlife of this neighborhood. Sometimes events and live music."
"Traditional bar with cheap beers. Cheap drinks on Tuesdays 10 DKK."
"This is another lively ''værtshus'' in the inner city. Hjorten (The Deer) seems to have been visited by a taxidermist at some point, as the interior theme is clearly stuffed deers. Have a game of dice here with some friends. Smoking allowed."
"Apart from cheap beer and drinks you can play snooker and dart here for free or spend some coins on table football or a couple of slot machines if you like. Sometimes televised football or events. Smoking allowed. Harmonien (The Harmony) is a true ''værtshus''."
"Traditional ''værtshus'' a bit out of the central scene, close to Trøjborg. With a long history and formerly owned by a famous circus-family, this bar is decorated with clowns and old circus paraphernalia. Try a ""circus-set"" for 36 DKK."
"Camp site, at the village of Lisbjerg 4&nbsp;km north of Aarhus. Easy access to nature here. Bus lines connect easily to the city center in about 15-20 minutes."
"Camp site in the beautiful Marselisborg Forest, 5&nbsp;km south of the city center. Cabins too. Can be reached by bus."
"This hostel is in the Riis Skov urban forest about 3&nbsp;km north of the city centre. Can be reached by bus. You can both store and make your own food here and save. Easy access to the city from here. 5 minute walk to reach Trøjborg and 15-20 min walk from the city centre. There is a bus terminal (Marienlund) for several local city bus lines close by."
"Basic hostel in Havnegade in the city center 5&nbsp;min from the train station. Functional but rather spartan, and not very clean. Dormitory from €18."
"Right in the center between the Cathedral and Åen. Rooms go from €71 (single) to €103 (triples). The rooms are quite small but a TV and private shower and toilet are included. Two stars. The hotel was heavily renovated and rebuilt in 2013-15."
"A modern tower situated just outside the centre in Viby, near the main approach roads to the city, 500 meters from the E45 motorway. Three stars."
"A modern town hotel which has been refurbished in 2015. The Mayor Hotel offers a large breakfast made by an in-house baker and serves special roasted coffee and fresh pressed orange juice. There is also a good evening hotel restaurant. All this just beside the shopping street and train yard."
"Set in a modern high-rise building with views across the harbor and the city. Three stars."
"A clean hotel in the Marselisborg marina. The hotel is unmanned and so check-in is done on a computer. The marina is a nice place to sit and watch the sunset with a bottle of wine from the vending machine! (no mini-bars) and is only a 15 minute walk from the main city centre, although you can catch the bus if you want. There are a couple of restaurants and an ice-cream shop there so you don't have to leave the marina if you don't want to."
"Best Western hotel, just next to the train station. Three stars."
"Hotel opened June 2008, furnished with Nordic design. Close to the central station right in the city centre, but in a quiet location."
"Large hotel in minimal brick exterior, at the square of Margrethepladsen, right in the city center. Next to the Scandinavian Congress Center, the Concert Halls, Godsbanen, ARoS Art museum, the City Hall and the long pedestrian shopping street of ''Strøget''. Four stars. Gourmet hotel restaurant [http://www.lapyramide.dk/ La Pyramide] of superb quality."
"Small exclusive boutique-hotel at the riverside promenade in the city center. Only a few, but large and luxurious suites and studio-apartments. Exquisite and praised street level brasserie and restaurant with a stylish decor. Excellent and equally stylish, but in a different design, restaurant and lounge bar known as FF Aarhus in a separate building in the back yard, a bit withdrawn from the busy riverside."
"Brand new design hotel (opened summer 2014) with 240 rooms, located in the city's newest and tallest highrise, Aarhus City Towers. Four stars."
"A small French oasis bursting with an almost private atmosphere and character. Four stars."
"Luxury hotel in the centre. Four stars. Historic hotel from 1838. The hotel restaurant of Queens Garden is a good French inspired mid-range restaurant. English garden and casino. Nice decorations and designs overall. Study the creative bronze sculptures at the hotel main entrance made by the local artist Hans Krull. He runs his own bar and café ""Under Masken"" just next door."
"Large, very new hotel (opened 2012) in the city centre, right next to the main pedestrian street and just a few hundred metres from the central station."
"Built in 1989, a six-storey hotel two kilometres from the Old Town and four kilometres from the city center and train station. Three stars."
"Situated a bit out of the central scene, near the park of Mindeparken in the Marselisborg Forests overlooking the bay. This monumental waterfront hotel was designed by Danish architects Friis and Molkte and completed in 1967. Four stars."
"Small hotel in the older central parts of town known as the Latin Quarter. Two stars. Nice patio."
"This ""kro"" from 1884 has a highly acclaimed gourmet restaurant. Malling Kro is a member of both ""La Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs"" and ""L'Ordre Mondial des Gourmets Dégustateurs"" and has a celebrated winechart. Take a trip here to dine or plan a stay. Malling Kro is situated in the old railway town of Malling, just across the central station about 12 km south of Aarhus."
"This histroic kro is located just a couple of kilometres east of Malling in the small coastal village of Norsminde. Outstanding dining here with an international gourmet cuisine. Both a high-end restaurant and a more informal and affordable brasserie. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, coffee and cake and evening dinners. Sometimes outdoor serving. Easy access to good beaches. An alternative and picturesque route to this place is by road from Aarhus through the Marselisborg Forests and then along the coast."
"A historic Kro from 1801 in the small village of Nørre Vissing, 22 km west of Aarhus. The area here is part of the extensive region of Søhøjlandet in beautiful nature. Nørre Vissing Kro is a great place to eat and just a 15 minutes drive from Aarhus Ådal Golf Club."
"Unlike the stereotypical Danish kro, Sabro Kro is a modern kro, with modern buildings and modern facilities, but with historic roots as a kro of Royal priviledge. Today it is being run as a four-star hotel as part of the Montra group, owning several small hotels (old and new) across Denmark. It is located just 12 km from Aarhus in the village of Sabro at the expressway of Viborgvej. For a kro, Sabro Kro is rather large with close to seventy doublerooms and several suites with spa and other luxury facilities and it is built to accommodate larger conferences and celebrations as well as individual tourists and business travelers. The food is good and include weekend brunch options and several events are held here, including concerts with national celebrities. Sabro Kro has a green environmental profile, awarded with the international Green Key certificate and is also holding a silver-certificate as GreenLeader (awarded by TripAdvisor). Lyngbygaard Golf is close by, as are Borum Eshøj, a small prehistoric site of three Bronze Age round barrows."
"Includes the city's aquarium, botanical garden, zoo, and Tingley Beach (see below under ''Do''). Combo tickets for the Biological Park can be purchased and include the price of train rides on a small narrow-gauge train running between the Aquarium/Botanic Garden and the Zoo. The train runs Tu-Su from around 10AM-4PM at 30&nbsp;min. intervals."
"It may not be as big as your average big city zoo, but this zoo is surprisingly comprehensive for its size, with most of the popular species you can expect to find at any good zoo: polar bears, lions, zebras, tigers, giraffes, elephants, gorillas, etc. And like any good zoo, the animals are in nice, naturalistic exhibits. The highlight exhibit areas are the seals, the polar bears, a large Africa area, and a large elephant enclosure. Every day there are scheduled feedings of the seals and the polar bears; during the warmer months more feeding times, activities, and outdoor concerts are scheduled. A small narrow-gauge train runs through the zoo (Tu-Su 10AM-3:30PM at 20&nbsp;min. intervals), with a conductor pointing out some of the animals and explaining what goes on behind-the-scenes. A separate train line runs to the Aquarium/Botanic Garden."
"Albuquerque's small but pleasant aquarium is well-curated, with exhibits designed to simulate the Rio Grande and the saltwater marshes of the Gulf of Mexico before moving on to ocean species. Among the sea creatures on display are jellyfish, seahorses, eels, and plenty of colorful reef fish, with the highlight being a huge tank at the end with sharks, sea turtles, and rays. Divers enter the big tank every day from 2-3PM to feed the fish."
"Next door to the Aquarium, this expansive botanical garden is one of Albuquerque's real gems. The place is an oasis with a variety of gardens to explore, with an emphasis on high desert plants but also with many highlight exhibits that are great for children: an indoor conservatory with lush Mediterranean plants, an insectarium with plenty of creepy-crawlies, an indoor butterfly pavilion that's open in the summer, a large Japanese garden with a koi pond and a waterfall, a recreation of an early 20th century farm with a barnyard petting zoo, a model railroad, and a fantastic children's ""Fantasy Garden"" made to look as if you've shrunk down to a bug's size, with giant pretend vegetables, garden tools and bugs."
"Overlooking the balloon launch field is this very interesting museum dedicated to the science and history of ballooning, with exhibits on hot air balloons and other lighter-than-air craft (including a couple of historic craft occupying the expansive hall), collections and memorabilia from famous balloonists, and extensive exhibits on ballooning in Albuquerque. If you can't make it to the Balloon Fiesta, this is next best thing, and if you ''can'' make it to the Balloon Fiesta, this makes for an excellent complement to a morning spent at a mass ascension."
"A tourist complex operated by the 19 Indian Pueblos of New Mexico. Though there is a museum about pueblo history and culture on-site, it's rather small and tucked away, with most of the complex given over to more lucrative ventures like an art gallery, a restaurant, and a large gift shop (a better museum experience can be found at the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture up in Santa Fe). Besides the gift shop, the best reason to visit this place is the regularly scheduled Indian dances which take place in the courtyard."
"A large complex of buildings dedicated to Hispanic culture, with a small but very interesting art museum with changing exhibitions of Hispanic art. There is also a library, restaurant, gift shop, and a regular schedule of special events and performances."
"A museum devoted to things nuclear, with extensive exhibits on the history of nuclear weapons including replicas of the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs dropped in WWII as well as other weapons and displays on arms control and uses of atomic energy. Even for those who are skeptical of the merits of nuclear arms and power, a visit to this museum makes for an interesting experience; a particularly illuminating exhibit is a guestbook where visitors are invited to share their thoughts regarding the use of atomic bombs on Japan, and as one might expect, such a controversial matter invites a wide variety of strong opinions. Outside the museum is a collection of nuclear-capable aircraft standing alongside rockets, missiles, and even a cannon designed to fire nuclear bombs."
"Runs from a lower terminus in the northeast heights to the top of 10,400-foot (3169&nbsp;m) Sandia Peak east of the city, and is one of the longest and most spectacular aerial tramways in the world. The first upward tram departs at 9AM (except Tu in the off season), and service continues until early evening. The 15-min. ride to the top is incredible, bringing you right up to the rocky face of the Sandias. The view of the city from Sandia Peak is tremendous (especially after sunset), and there is a restaurant and a visitor center at the top. Closed for two weeks in spring and fall for ""maintenance,"" but spring winds are so intense that you really don't want to be on an aerial tram then anyway."
"Operated by the local Unser racing family, this museum is dedicated to the racing legacy of the Unsers as well as to the sport of auto racing in general."
"Guided walking tours of Old Town start here. An excellent example of a city-specific museum, with a large permanent collection of Southwestern art, changing art exhibitions, artifacts from the history of colonial New Mexico and Albuquerque through the years (with some pretty neat items, like conquistador armor and antique cars), and an outdoor sculpture garden. The Albuquerque Museum also operates the historic home of '''[http://www.cabq.gov/museum/history/casatour.html Casa San Ysidro]''' in nearby Corrales for tours."
"This great little museum's claim to fame is the largest collection of different species of live rattlesnakes in the world. There's lots of snakes (and various other reptiles) and snake-related memorabilia, such as artwork and films, and the gift shop is not to be missed."
"A truly splendid science and children's museum, this museum has lots of interactive exhibits teaching science, technology, and art. There are some fantastic exhibits here, like a laminar flow fountain with water jets you can turn on and off, an experiment bar, a high-wire bike, and a robotics lab."
"This splendid museum has well-constructed geological and paleontological displays which illustrate a ""journey through time"", covering everything from the birth of the planet to the Ice Age. There's plenty of dinosaurs around, from the statues outside the main entrance, to a ''T. rex'' in the atrium, to one massive hall with several complete (and massive) dinosaur skeletons. Additionally, an entire wing of the museum is devoted to astronomical exhibits, and there's also an exhibit about the birth of the personal computer, which happened right here in Albuquerque. A planetarium and a large-screen theater are also in the building."
"While the location isn't ideal (located in a strip mall near Old Town, rather than in the historic district itself), this small gift shop/museum has some interesting exhibits about turquoise and its manufacture, history, and mythology. Reservations required."
"The anthropology department at UNM has been acclaimed as one of the finest in the nation, and over the years its field schools have amassed an impressive collection of artifacts. The museum has changing exhibits and two permanent exhibits; one showcasing the evolution of humans from primates, and the other focusing on the prehistoric native cultures in the American Southwest, with a reconstruction of an archaeological dig in Chaco Canyon."
"In the university's geology department building are a pair of galleries with minerals, fossils, and meteorites collected by UNM faculty and students, as well as exhibits about local geology."
"Changing exhibitions of art, with a focus on New Mexico and UNM artists."
"The center for the city's open space program, which encompasses land from around the city to preserve for environmental and recreational use. The visitor center has exhibits on the natural and cultural resources of the area, an art gallery, a nature area, and views of the bosque and mountains."
"On the west side of town, Petroglyph is a unit of the United States National Parks system and preserves a significant archaeological site with an impressive number of petroglyphs. Despite their proximity to an urban center, the petroglyphs are in good condition with very little vandalism or theft. The monument has a visitor center with some interpretive exhibits and a few short trails that lead past numerous petroglyphs. Also within the monument are a series of volcanic cinder cones overlooking the city, accessible by hiking trails from Atrisco Vista Blvd along the backside of the monument."
"A very pleasant state park running along the banks of the Rio Grande through Albuquerque. The park encompasses almost the entirety of the ''bosque'' (cottonwood forest) in the city, which is home to much wildlife, such as geese, roadrunners, beavers, rabbits, squirrels, and numerous other species. Numerous trails criss-cross the park, most notably the [http://www.cabq.gov/openspace/paseodelbosquetrail.html Paseo del Bosque paved bike/walk trail] which runs the length of the park. There are also several picnic areas and wetland areas, two of the most prominent listed below."
"The bosque provides a tranquil setting for this small but delightful nature center, with its wildlife pond and exhibits on the native wildlife. Nature lovers will particularly enjoy the enclosed views of the pond behind the visitor center. Two short trails head into the bosque from the visitor center."
"A facility of the Albuquerque Biological Park, this park along the Rio Grande has fishing ponds for adults and children, a model boating pond, a cafe, and a gift shop where you can buy fishing licenses, fishing gear, or rent a pedal boat for a ride on the central pond. Trails lead into the bosque to the edge of the river and to a pair of restored wetland ponds. A narrow-gauge train links Tingley Beach to the Albuquerque Aquarium/Botanical Gardens and the Rio Grande Zoo (listed above under ''See'')."
"The Isotopes, Triple-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, play baseball in a beautiful stadium. Seats in the park are both good and cheap&mdash;$13 can get you a seat behind home plate. All the concessions and restrooms are located along a big concourse behind the seats which is open to the field, so you don't miss any of the action. For $7 a ticket, you can bring a picnic blanket and find a spot in the grassy ""Berm"" behind right field that's perfect for kids&mdash;they can enjoy the grass and play on the playground on top of the Berm. Beware of foul balls&mdash;The park is a notorious ""launching pad"" for hitters that drives pitchers nuts."
"This is just about the only amusement park in New Mexico. Fairly small, but with a good amount of rides. Thrill rides (including two roller coasters), family rides, kiddy rides, and a water play area."
"The Lobos are ''big''. For a deafening experience in college sports, try to catch a basketball game at ""The Pit,"" the university's semi-underground fieldhouse that has been a house of pain for visiting basketball teams for 50 years. The women's teams have often been better than the men's in this century, and attract crowds every bit as raucous - when the teams are doing really good, games will sell out. Right across the street is University Stadium, home of the immensely popular Lobos football team."
"Has four rinks under one roof. A great place to sharpen your figure skating or hockey skills or just skate for fun."
"This historic and beautiful downtown building is a vibrant setting for the local preforming arts community, as well as a venue for some traveling shows. The theater is gorgeous and filled with Pueblo-esque art deco ornamentation, such as beautiful murals, plaster cow skulls and wooden beams."
"Hosts a schedule of live performances year-round, including Broadway musicals, live theater, dance and music."
"Located in south Albuquerque, this is the city's primary concert venue."
"Home to the Fusion Theater Company, a local performance group."
"Hosting local performances throughout the year."
"Featuring sketch comedy, improv, children's shows, and other works. Home to Cardboard Playhouse Productions and Blackout Theatre Company."
"An intimate performance space that produces innovative plays year round."
"The only one which operates directly from Balloon Fiesta Park during the Balloon Fiesta"
"Second only to the Balloon Fiesta, the state fair is a massive event in the Albuquerque calendar. Like any state fair, there's lots of agricultural competitions, farm animals, rodeos, carnival rides, art, music, and fried food. Unique to the New Mexico State Fair are lots of exhibits that show off the pride and character of New Mexico, such as art galleries, a performing arts center, an Indian Village (where you can watch Native American music and dance) and the Villa Hispana, where you can see regular demonstrations of local art and culture."
"An event bringing Native Americans from across the country together. There are many events, including the powwow, native music, arts, crafts, and food, and Miss Indian World. The event takes place in late April at the UNM Arena (""The Pit"")."
"One of the most exciting Flamenco gatherings in the country, with artists from around the world. Held annually during the summer, usually in early June, at a number of venues."
"Takes place in June at the Expo New Mexico fairgrounds and features a great variety of arts and crafts all made locally."
"If you're looking for all the ""New Mexican"" shops, this is probably the next best thing to Santa Fe. Granted, some of it is tacky souvenir stuff, but there are also plenty of quality gift shops with authentic Native American and Southwestern art. You can also find plenty of antiques, art galleries, jewelry, pottery, weavings, clothing stores, and other specialty shops."
"A juried photography co-op of award-winning photographers, representing a wide variety of styles and techniques."
"Co-op of 40 contemporary artists selling a wide variety of southwestern arts and crafts."
"A popular candy shop with lots of homemade fudge, chocolates, caramels, and other sweets, though it has also gained notice for providing the blue-colored hard candy that served as the meth prop in the locally-set ''Breaking Bad'' television series. You can buy a bag of a faithful recreation of the prop, which is now one of the shop's most popular products."
"A wonderful store with an extensive collection of minerals, geologic specimens, gems, beads, supplies for the geologist, information about local geology, and more. Anyone even slightly interested in geology could spend a lot of time here."
"A very large gift shop with all the typical tourist kitsch, which certainly has its charm."
"Featuring works by several popular artists, including noted local painter R.C. Gorman."
"A long-standing business selling native arts and crafts."
"While downtown has plenty of bars and restaurants, the shopping scene is a bit lacking. However, there are a few interesting places:"
"Has a huge selection of Western hats."
"A retail boutique with art, jewelry, and some nifty around-the-home accessories."
"Indian jewelry, arts, and crafts in a lovely building dating back to the heyday of Route 66."
"Fine art, jewelry, and furnishings."
"An upscale designer consignment boutique offering top quality clothing, accessories and handbags."
"A trendy district known for its neon reminiscent of the Route 66 days, Nob Hill is easily one of the best places in the city to window shop. The '''Nob Hill Business Center''', at Central & Carlisle, has some great little shops as well as the La Montanita Food Co-Op (''see Grocery stores under ""Eat"" below'')."
"Stock up on all your herb supplies and herbal remedies here."
"An art gallery and store cram packed with Day of the Dead folk art."
"Fine furnishings and accessories."

"An outdoor mall with more high-end retail stores, such as Apple Computer, Talbots, Pottery Barn, and Williams-Sonoma."
"A typical indoor mall, the surrounding area contains most typical 'big box' retailers."
"Formerly Wargames West on Central, this store has a long history in Albuquerque. Features cards, board games, role-playing games and a gambit of miniature table-top games. Open boardgame night is Thursday, but you're bound to find people gaming any night of the week."
"Owned by the Sandia Pueblo, this huge market has loads of Native American jewelry, pottery, rugs, paintings and folk art. Most of the stuff here comes directly from the artist to the market."
"A locally-owned jewelry chain in Albuquerque with plenty of antiques and Southwestern jewelry. There are three locations around the city:"
"A local chain of stores (there is also a location in Santa Fe) that sells folk art, pottery, rugs, and furniture from around the world. There is really a lot of fantastic stuff here, and a lot to browse through."
"The largest independent bookstore in the city."
"Serves excellent New Mexican cuisine from a stand."
"A cozy little restaurant with good New Mexican food tucked away down a side alley of Old Town."
"An inexpensive lunch counter in the back of a pharmacy serving cheap, hearty New Mexican cuisine."

"A pleasant sit-down restaurant with a milder chile."

"Consistent quality. Often a long wait. Hot chile."
"This place, for those who know how to find it (it ''is'' tucked in a corner) is a local favorite, serving menudo, chile, and a wide range of other both Mexican and New Mexican foods. They are also locally known for their tea, a blend of chamomile teas, always served hot and fresh. Also, as you are about to pay, make sure and check out the candy table right in front of the cash registers, as you might just spot an old favorite such as Sugar Daddys and Nik-L-Nips!"
"Excellent menu, ala carte items, full bar, World Record Margarita. Local favorite."

Bakery also carries various Vietnamese desserts, steamed sweet/glutinous rice with mung beans, and Vietnamese steamed pork sausages."
"A home-grown chain of burger stands with a New Mexican flair. The ones west of the river are owned by Bob, the ones east of the river by his son-in-law Clifford. Bob makes some of the hottest green chile sauce in the state; Clifford flat out tries to kill you. A ""chile-head""'s paradise. Try a foot-long chile-cheese dog with green sauce instead of traditional red."
"The place is a little bare-bones, but the food is excellent (and shows the difference between ""Mexican"" and ""New Mexican"" cuisine), not to mention cheap. Get a ''horchata'' as your drink."
"One of the most popular restaurants in Albuquerque; a big hangout for the college students at UNM. Good American and New Mexican food, the breakfast burrito here is one of the best in Albuquerque. The atmosphere is casual, and it's a great place to people-watch and witness a good cross-section of the city's population. If you can't make it to the Frontier, you can go to one of the several '''Golden Pride''' chain places around Albuquerque, which is owned by the same family and serves much of the same food."
"Enjoy some authentic Albuquerque cuisine, restaurant is best known for serving a fry covered, football sized burrito called the Travis.

"Persian food. Cushion seating available, bellydancing on weekend nights. Hookah available for rental. Wonderful Persian classics."

"One of the finest restaurants in Albuquerque, and the winner of multiple awards. American cuisine, serving prime aged beef, seafood and poultry grilled over aromatic woods."

The city took the spot over in 1999 by hiring artist Katherine Tombeau Cost to paint over the original mural and graffiti with a new 5,000-square-foot mural. The graffiti artists haven't entirely relinquished their claim to it, meaning that Cost's mural has been partially defaced with large bubble lettering, but it's still an interesting (and out-of-the-way) sight. Be sure to seek out the ""trippers'"" bubble gum wall toward the back. During warmer weather, you'll often find musicians or dancers putting on solo performances in the alley entrance, hoping to glean donations."

"Held the first Saturday in April. The Hash Bash began when poet John Sinclair was jailed for marijuana possession, leading John Lennon and Yoko Ono to headline a protest rally in Ann Arbor in 1971. Beginning in 1972, it became an annual event to commemorate the occasion and support the reform of marijuana laws. The Hash Bash is a gathering point for thousands of cannabis aficionados from all around, with guest speakers in the Diag attracting large crowds. Given the nature of the event, you probably will see people smoking marijuana; those who do light up tend to take advantage of the difference in fines between the town ($25) and the university ($100 and possible jail time), which basically means that your punishment depends on which side of State Street you stand on. Vendors sell everything from hemp bracelets to ""glass art"" (actually pipes and bongs, but who's quibbling?), bongo drums are played, and people-watching can be an event in itself."
"Once held in mid-April at midnight on the last day of classes. A tradition at the University of Michigan which began in 1986, in which hundreds of students — traditionally graduating seniors, although in practice there's a broader spread — ran across campus naked, while spectators cheered them on, to celebrate the end of the school year. Although technically illegal, it was tolerated by local police until 1998, when they began attempting to strongly discourage continuation of the Naked Mile, fueled in part by concerns over outsiders videotaping the event and selling the recordings online. In recent years, to avoid being arrested, students have run the Mile in body paint, underwear, or a day earlier than usual."
"Held in mid-May. First organized in 2004 to promote reading, heighten awareness of literacy challenges, and showcase the rich culture of the written word in Michigan and beyond.

Ticket prices vary and location changes every year. At TEDxUofM you'll be inspired, meet interesting people, and have great discussions. The event is generally held sometime in Spring."
"Held from mid-June to early July. Nightly local and regional live bands, outdoor film screenings at 10PM, and concession booths from eight local eateries. Traditionally this event was held on the upper level of the Fletcher parking structure, next to the Power Center — hence the name — but it has been temporarily moved outside the Rackham School of Graduate Studies. In inclement weather, performances and films may be cancelled."
"Held throughout downtown, four juried art fairs that display and sell art: the original [http://www.artfair.org/ Ann Arbor Street Art Fair] along N University; the [http://www.theguild.org/fairs/ann-arbor-art-fair/ Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair] along Main, Liberty, William and State; the [http://statestreetdistrict.org/fair/ State Street Area Art Fair]; and the [http://www.a2southu.com/ South University Art Fair]. In practical terms, it's all one great big fair that takes about a full day to explore if you move quickly and don't look at every booth. Prices are generally rather high, as befitting an art show of this calibre, but there are definitely bargains to be found, as well as some less expensive non-juried booths that tag along for the ride. Loads of concessions, live entertainment, and booths with great sales from local businesses are scattered throughout. During the Art Fair, hotels are generally booked up and parking can be difficult to find, so book a room early (by February or March) and find a spot at one of the park-and-ride stops to catch a bus into downtown."

"Yes, that's right, bats. Austin's Congress Avenue bridge is home to about 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats. This is the largest urban bat colony in the world and one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat colonies in North America. The bats are generally active at dusk every evening between March and November. In years when there has been a drought, the bats leave early (when there is still light), and can be a quite impressive sight. In years when there has been plenty of rain, they leave so late it is difficult to see much. Best place to see them is near the Austin American Statesman's parking lot, or you can pay for boat tours to see them from underneath the bridge. Towards the end of bat season, when the colony's young are flying for the first time, pedestrian crowds can become rather dense. Try to arrive at least an hour before dark if you want to have a good, unobstructed view."

One of the few places in town that feels like it is south of the border."
"Amazing tacos of every kind, including breakfast tacos. Try the green chile pork or the democrat."

"Overnight trains are available from Russia, Ukraine and Georgia on a regular basis. Moscow (60 h) has departures three times a week, there is also a once-weekly train leaving Saint Petersburg (70 h) on Sundays. Other cities with less frequent connections include Novosibirsk (80 h) and Yekaterinburg (75 h). Kiev (68 h) has a service leaving every Saturday, with carriages added from several other cities. Also, on some occasions there is a direct train from the Belarusian city of Brest (81 h) which also stops in Minsk (76 h). However, it is important to note that the border between Russia and Azerbaijan is '''closed for non-CIS nationals''' for the foreseeable future. So unless you're a resident of a former Soviet country then this journey is impossible. However, there are still ways of getting here by train '''as a westerner'''. There is an overnight sleeper from Tbilisi in neighboring Georgia leaving daily. The journey lasts 17 hours. The train makes a stop-over in Ganja. A journey in second class from Tbilisi costs 63 laris. In summer (15/06-01/10) the schedules were: Tbilisi 16:30 Baku 09:20, 62.63 GEL 2nd class/Baku 20:30 Tbilisi 10:45, 29.45 AZN 2nd class, daily service.

"The medieval palace of the Shirvan Shahs is the highlight of the Old City and a must see for any tourist in Baku. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum, a portal in the east - Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of the bath-house. - The ''' main building ''' of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 different dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with 3 narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, also an octagonal vestibule, located behind it, connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace. - '''Divankhana''' is a small stone pavilion. It is situated inside a small courtyard surrounded by a gallery-arcade on three sides. The Divankhana pavilion consists of an octahedral hall covered with a stone cupola both inside and outside. The well-proportioned high portal of the main entrance is decorated with an ornament and Arabic inscription. The ornament pictures the interlacing fig and vine leaves. The portal is also decorated with two medallions inside of which there are inscriptions in Kufic Arabic. - The '''Mausoleum''' of the Shirvanshahs is of a rectangular shape and crowned with a hexahedral cupola which is decorated from outside with multi-radial stars. The inscription on the entrance doorway indicates the purpose of the building, ""Khalilullah I, the greatest Soltan, Great Shirvanshah, the namesake of the divine prophet, the defender of the religion ordered to construct this light burial-vault for his mother and son in 839"" (1435–1436). On two drop-shaped medallions in the flannel parts of the portal there are inscriptions with the architect's name - Memar Ali (architect Ali). - The '''Palace Mosque''' (1430s) is situated in the lower court of the complex. The laconicism of its prismatic volumes, completed with two slightly pointed cupolas, is shaded by a well-proportioned vertical line of the minaret rising above in the north-eastern corner of the building. There are 2 chapels for prayers in the mosque: a hall of a large size for men and a hall of a small size for women, also a couple of small subsidiary rooms. There is an inscription laid under the stalactite belt of the minaret which reads, ""The greatest Soltan Khalilullah I ordered to build this minaret. May Allah exalt the days of his governing and reign. The year of 845"" (1441–1442). - '''Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's Mausoleum''' is situated in the southern part of the complex. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was a royal scholar in the court of Shirvanshah Khalilullah. The Mausoleum is of an octahedral shape and covered with an octahedral marquee. It consists of ground and underground parts. The upper part of the Mausoleum served to perform the cult rites, and the lower one housed the sepulchral vault. There are three small lancet windows with a stone bar - shabaka on the southern, eastern and western verges of the Mausoleum. - The Shirvanshahs' Palace complex also includes the portal of Eastern Gates, the so-called ""Sultan Murad's Gate"" (1585). It was built within the walls of the citadel rather later than all the other constructions of the complex during Ottoman occupation of 1585-1603rd century. The gates were named by them in honor of Sultan Murad III. - The Palace '''Bath-house''' is situated on the lowest terrace of the complex. It was discovered in 1939 and dates to 17th century. The archaeological excavations exposed a big bath-house consisting of 26 rooms. On the basis of the surviving remains of the walls of the bath-house one can say that its rooms used to be covered with cupolas and the light penetrated through the openings in the cupolas. The bath-house was semi-underground for keeping the heat in winter and the cool in summer."
"- Plan of the mosque is rectangular. There is a small hall, small prayer room for women and serving rooms. The northern portal, rotated to a burial vault of Shirvanshahs is more solemn than the eastern one. The latter, which was coming down to underground exit, was intended for habitants of the palace. - '''Interior'''. Two tier windowed prayer room is covered with cupola with spherical sails. Mihrab is located in the southern end of the palace. Cupola area over one a tier women prayer room ceding to cupola of the hall with its dimensions and replacing its outlines. Aperture of the mosque’s portal is clearly described on severe background of prismatic volume, ended with two cupolas with slightly sharpening calottes. - '''Minaret'''. Trunk of the minaret is surrounded by an inscription, a ligature of which has a date of 845 (1441/42). Details of sherefe’s stalactites are subtly modeled."
"This mysterious and eccentric tower was built somewhere between the 7th and 12th centuries and may have served as a fire beacon, defensive fortification, astronomical observatory, or Zoroastrian temple. - The tower, which is Baku's most distinguished landmark, described as the ""most majestic and mysterious monument of Baku, the Gyz Galasy"", built on solid rock foundation, demonstrates right on the coast line, a fusion of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman influences. It was constructed alongside a natural oil well. It is a cylindrical eight story structure that rises to a height of 29.5 m with a base diameter of 16.5 m. The internal space available in the tower is said to be adequate to accommodate 200 people. A long solid projection to the main tower faces east, which is oriented towards sunrise pointing to the equinoxes, which has led to the conclusion that it was built as an astronomical tower; while the buttress faces east, the door access to the tower faces southeast. Each floor of the tower has a shallow vaulted roof, ""a stone cupola"" that has a central opening. The thickness of the walls varies from 5 m at the base tapering cylindrically to 3.2–4.2 m at the top floors. All floors are connected by staircase which abuts the circular wall and are lighted by narrow windows or niches which flare inward. The structure built in stone masonry exhibits varying finished surfaces, which is inlaid with local grey limestone. The alternate courses of stone laid in gypsum plaster gives a black and white banded effect. The northwestern part of the tower retains the original surface finish. There is also a beak-like projection, a buttress, curved in shape, made in masonry. The earliest stonework has square corners. - A detailed examination of the construction features of the tower by archaeologists suggests that the stone masonry, both on its interior and exterior surfaces, is diamond shaped and is seen at the top as well as at the bottom of the tower wall. The diamond shaped cut seen as a decorative feature, particularly on the outer face of the west side wall, is ornate at the top and plain at the bottom of the wall; a subtle feature noted throughout the tower suggests that it was built as one monolith unit at one period. However, the recent renovations are stated to be crude. - '''Water Well''': Another notable structure seen in the tower is a water well of 0.7 m diameter, which is 21 m deep (its depth is up to the aquifer) that has been discovered at the second floor of the tower. It has an entrance also at the ground level which was discovered by Archaeologist Abbas Islamov during a recent study of the tower. This well has been interpreted as rainwater harvesting structure and the water is said to be clean and fresh (though close to the sea). The ceramic pipe (30 cm in diameter) plumbing seen running down from the niches of the tower into the well was meant as a supply source. Since the ancient plumbing system is said to be in its original form, it needs to be cleaned and its layout ascertained by further studies to describe the drainage network that was originally built as part of the tower. The ceramics of the plumbing system and the silt deposited in them could also help to fix the age of the tower by using thermo-luminescence technique. - Also seen in the tower, between the 2nd floor and the 7th floor, is a gutter of semicircular shape at every floor. It is made of ceramic pipes fitted one above another and joined by lime mortar. The pipes are presumably produced with the potter's wheel technique. They are 20–25 cm in diameter with 2.2 cm thick walls and each segment is 40–45 cm long. Similar gutters are seen from the ground floor up to the foundation level but with the four cornered ceramic pipes of 22 cm× 18 cm size, which run outside through the wall."

"This temple has a massive monolith of Lord Shiva, located in the middle of an artificial pool. There is a cave-like walkthrough behind the statue. It is extremely crowded on the festival of Maha Shivaratri. One can't see or feel any kind of Bhakti in this temple, because at each move inside the temple there will be a person located for collection of money which creates such a disturbance for the concentration on Bhakti.

As if India wasn't cheap enough. Although this is the best place to go to for factory outlet shopping, there are smaller factory outlets scattered across the city. Also look out for sales held by the major brands to get rid of end of season stock (again end of summer or end of monsoon), these are usually advertised in newspapers or look for signs posted on major roads."
"The sale capital of Bengaluru, located on Infantry Road. Every week there is sale going on of any type. One week it might be home furnishings and the next men's wear. Good place to find some bargains. Many exhibitions are also held here, although there are retailers (Dockers, Lee Jeans, Titan too name a few) here too. So for quiet shopping come here (much less crowded than the other malls). Its best to visit during end of season sales (summer, monsoon) or during festivals (New Year, Christmas, Ganesh Chaturthi)."

"Also known as the ""Bird's Nest"" (鸟巢 ''Niǎocháo''), this stadium, designed by Herzog & Meuron, is the world's largest steel structure. It hosted opening and closing ceremonies, as well as athletic and football matches during the olympics. It was planned to host football matches after the Olympics, but due to few expected spectators the football club backed out of the agreement. Therefore, the stadium has found very little use after the olympics and is planned to be converted to a shopping and entertainment complex."
"Also known as the ""Water Cube"" (水立方 Shǔilìfāng) Swimming and diving venue. Tickets to visit the inside of the Water Cube are sold throughout the day. The ticket office is inconveniently located by the tour bus parking lot at the northwest corner of the building (which is a fair hike from the building entrance at the southeast corner, facing the stadium). The building also sometimes now hosts sound and light shows in the evenings."
"Gymnastics venue."
"An old stadium renovated to be a football (soccer) venue, still used for sports events and major concerts."

"Taoist temple founded in 1319 with hundreds of life size plaster figures and the possibility of making offerings to different gods responsible for all kind of stuff. The temple also houses the Beijing Folk Arts Museum. Very quiet and peaceful spot."
"The largest park in Beijing at 3km by 1.5km. The park features an artificial beach, two large swimming pools, a bungee jumping tower, boat rental, concert stages, sports areas, a number of amusement park rides, flower areas and much more. The individual entertainment options might not be impressive, but the size of the park and the number of local visitors makes a stroll here delightful anyway."
"The park contains the Temple of the Sun with an altar built in 1530 and used for sacrifices to the sun. Great park with entertainment for the children, good cafés and restaurants, plenty of local life to watch and also historical stuff. The altar itself is a round open space popular for flying kites. If you couldn't get close to the ""Echo Wall"" at Temple of Heaven due to crowds, you can do the same trick here (although only on a quarter rather than the whole circle). Also climb to the pavilion at the top of the small hill in the park for a surround view of the CBD skyline."
"Park and museum with buildings and exhibitions showing the characteristics of China's 56 nationalities. This does give a good overview and a better understanding of the diversity of China, but everything seems a bit dated and dusty. Also restaurants and shops in the park."
"Amusement park established in 2006 and by far the largest in Beijing covering around 1km2 and comprising more than 40 rides divided in different themed areas."

"A great place to enjoy your free time by playing sports"
"The original foreign-oriented market, in the first embassy district (now the CBD). It was re-opened in March 2005 as a 5 storey air-conditioned building. You can find luggage, leather bags, electronics, sporting goods, jewellery, clothing and Chinese artwork. This market caters almost entirely to foreign customers. However, compared to other Asian markets in, say, Hong Kong and Bangkok, this market may be overpriced. Counterfeit Polo Ralph Lauren golf shirts in Hong Kong are roughly 30HKD (US $4) while at the Silk Market, the general starting price is roughly US $50 and you would be lucky after lengthy bargaining to get the shirt for US $20. As another example of prices: bargaining for fake Diesel-brand jeans might start at ¥1200 and end up at ¥85. Shoes may not be worth buying here, as their soles are often uncomfortably thin. Tourists may want to consider spending their money elsewhere."
"Modern, international mall opened in 2008, beside Yashow market. Many international brand names, including Apple, Adidas, Uniqlo. Also numerous cafes and restaurants, and a cinema in the basement."
"Here you will find a lot of expensive stores and some international convenience stores."
"Also called the ""dirt market"" or the ""weekend market,"" this is China's largest and possibly its most entertaining flea market. It operates from Sun-Sat, most people visit there on the weekend, and it is located near Pan Jia Yuan bridge, on the eastern third ring road. It begins early, around 07:00 in summer and 08:00 in winter (04:00 on the weekend). The flea market includes mostly fake antiques and large sections selling admittedly modern porcelain, jade, carved stone and wood, paintings, furniture, and other decorative items, used books, maps, and Cultural Revolution kitsch replicas. There are also sections selling Tibetan goods, although mostly of low quality, especially the paintings. Textiles made by members of minority nationalities from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are amongst the more interesting buys at the moment. Well worth a visit, unless you are allergic to crowds. Remember to bargain, try offer 1/10 to 1/3 of the original price and be sure to shop around as many stalls have similar or identical goods. Panjiayuan's established dealers also provide shipping service for large items to main ports around the world."
"On the 3rd ring road, just beyond Panjiayuan. This four story white building houses the more upmarket variety of Chinese antiques, with prices to match. The management have been making determined efforts to stamp out fakes and low quality items in recent years and, to some extent, have succeeded. However, the rule that applies to all antique shopping in China still remains in force: buyer beware."
"A small two-storey market selling clothes, T-shirts, luggage, purses, wallets, some souvenirs etc. They have nothing you can't also buy at Yashow, but they are much smaller and calmer, so more relaxing. Convenient if you're staying at Lido hotel or in the area."
"A relic of communist China: where all foreigners used to have to shop. Prices are very high, and (not surprisingly) there's hardly anyone there. Come here to browse in peace and see what items and styles you like: then go to Silk market or Yashow to bargain for them."
"First floor is cut flowers, all inexpensive. Around the sides are potted plants, home decorations, lamps. Upstairs are dishes and kitchenware."
"A varied shopping area in the new embassy district. Nuren Jie itself has restaurants and shops/market selling womens' clothing (hence the name). There is also the Laitai Flower Market, which sells potted plants, planters, cut flowers, and above and below has art and home decorations. Similar small shops line the street opposite the flower market. Opposite Laitai is an area called ""Super Bar Street"" with bars and restaurants, and during the day also has a large indoor market with mostly electronics."
"This outdoor complex is most well-known for having one of the largest LED screens in the world, which simultaneously serves as a futuristic roof. Come here in the evening to see various sorts of animations being shown over the full length of the screen. The Place also has a number of shops and cafes and is adjacent to another complex housing a number of restaurants."
"This is a typical local restaurant. Neither the food nor the decor are fancy, just cheap and good. No English spoken, although there is an English menu.

"Malaysian/Singaporean style food. Mee Goreng is good, as is Hainan chicken and freshly made curry puffs."
"One of the contenders in the ongoing competition for Beijing's best Sichuanese, Yuxin delivers on authenticity, flavor, and service. It's always busy, and always good."

"Upscale vegetarian restaurant. Setting and presentation is beautiful. In the tradition of Chinese vegetarianism, many of the dishes are typical dishes made with ""mock"" meat (tofu). Try the mock Beijing duck. There's a second location inside Holiday Inn Lido Hotel."
"Shintori is an exquisite Japanese restaurant which is almost impossible to find. Once you do find your way in, one can't help but be wowed when entering the main dining area. The food at Shintori is unquestionably good, but be prepared to pay a little more here."
"Lovely, fancy and expensive French/European restaurant. A la carte may be expensive, but lunch set menu is excellent value for money at ¥98, which includes a glass of wine."

"The Sino-Swiss Hotel is located very close to the airport, well away from city centre. It is presently the only major hotel in Beijing that allows pets.

Choose this hotel for its location if you need to be close to the airport or if you have pets."
"The only surviving Berlin city gate and a potent symbol of the city. This is the point where ''Straße des 17. Juni'' becomes ''Unter den Linden''. The gate was designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans in 1791 and was intended to resemble the Acropolis in Athens. The Brandenburg Gate now symbolizes reunification, after dividing East and West Berlin for decades"
"The large square in front of the Brandenburg Gate contains the French and American embassies, the rebuilt Hotel Adlon, and the new building of the Academy of Arts."
"A vast wedding cake of a building, built between 1949-1951 in the best Stalinist style and meant to symbolize the dominance of the Soviet Union in East German affairs before 1989."
"This former German Guggenheim branch is run entirely by Deutsche Bank since 2013. Compared to the Guggenheims in New York, Bilbao and Venice, it is a relatively small exhibition place. It usually hosts a temporary exhibition and is free on Monday, with a free guided tour starting at 16:00. Since the place is small and the name ""Guggenheim"" a very famous one, the place is often very crowded."
"Erected in 1818 to a classically-inspired design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel as a guardhouse for the imperial palace, since 1993 this compact building has housed a small, but extremely powerful war cenotaph, the Central Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany, continuing its use under East German rule as the primary ""Memorial to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism"". The interior of the Doric column-fronted building is intentionally empty, but for a small but moving sculpture by Käthe Kollwitz depicting a mother cradling a dead child. The statue is positioned beneath a round hole in the ceiling, exposing the figures to the rain and snow."
"Nazi Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels made Bebelplatz (then called ''Opernplatz'') infamous on 10 May 1933, when he used the square across from Humboldt University to burn 20,000 books by ""immoral"" authors of whom the Nazis did not approve. Their list included Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Arnold Zweig, Kurt Tucholsky and Sigmund Freud. Today a monument is the reminder, though it blames Nazi students for the episode. When entering the square it's easy to miss the monument. Look dead centre: the monument is underground. A piece of plexiglass allows the viewer to look underground into a large, white room, filled with entirely empty, blank white bookcases. The absence of books reminds the viewer just what was lost here: ideas. But the event did reveal things to come, as ethnically Jewish author and philosopher Heinrich Heine, whose books were burned, let one of his characters say in an 1821 play: ""This was only the foreplay. Where they burn books, they will also burn people."" He was correct."
"German historical museum covering everything from pre-history up to the present day. One can spend many, many hours here! The building from 1695/1730 was the ''Zeughaus'' (Arsenal) until 1876."
"Nice church located near Unter den Linden/Museum Island, finished in 1830 by Schinkel in English Neogothic style. Nice exhibition inside (neoclassical statues and an exhibition about Schinkel's life and work upstairs)."
"Domed Church located at Bebelplatz/Unter den Linden, the oldest (mid-18th century) and one of the biggest Catholic churches in Berlin. Interior was redesigned in a modern style in the 1950s – but still many treasure chambers in the basement."
"Millions of visitors leaving East Berlin by train said tearful goodbyes to their friends and relatives from the East at this former border checkpoint. Hardly a year after the wall came down, the building was turned into a nightclub until it was forced to close in 2006. It re-opened as a museum in September 2011 and now houses a permanent exhibition that brings the absurd normality of everyday life in the divided city back to life."
"The Gendarmenmarkt is a square in the Friedrichstadt with the '''Konzerthaus''' ''(concert hall)'' and in front of the statue of Germany's poet Friedrich Schiller, the '''Deutscher Dom''' ''(German cathedrals)'' and the '''Französischer Dom''' ''(French cathedrals)''."
"Berlin’s Deutscher Dom on the magnificent Gendarmenmarkt square is not to be confused with the Berliner Dom. It was built in 1708. Since 1992 a German Parliament exhibition can be seen here entitled “Paths, Loosing Track and Detours” or the development of parliamentary democracy in Germany – ways and roundabouts. No religious services are held here."
"The Hugenottenmuseum represents the ongoing influence on Berlin by the Huguenots who emigrated from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Crown Prince Friedrich William encouraged them to settle here because most of them were skilled workers or otherwise useful to the kingdom. One memorable artwork, in room nine of the museum, pictures Crown Princess Dorothea exclaiming ""But he's a refugee!"" upon being presented a very valuable set of jewels by Pierre Fromery. The generally agreed-upon view of refugees as poor, without resources let alone diamonds, was blown apart by the talented French Protestants forced to leave their country due to religion. One of the most notable effects of having such a large French population was their influence on the infamous Berlin dialect. Berlinerisch words such as Kinkerlitzchen (from French ""quincaillerie"" - kitchen equipment) and Muckefuck (from French ""mocca faux"" - artificial coffee, though ''that'' etymology is not universally accepted) are unique to the area. The Französischen Dom (cathedral) itself was built to resemble the main church of the Huguenots in Charenton, France, destroyed in 1688. It has housed the museum since 1929."
"A vast Holocaust memorial designed by the American architect Peter Eisenman. Opened in the spring of 2005, this gigantic abstract artwork covering an entire block near the Brandenburg Gate, including an underground museum with extensive details on the Holocaust and the people who died during it. The blocks start out at ground level on the outer edges of the memorial, and then grow taller towards the middle, where the ground also slopes downwards."
"The former Imperial General Post Office, now Museum for telecommunication and post with many interesting historical objects."
"It was the only border crossing between East and West Berlin that permitted foreigners passage. Residents of East and West Berlin were not allowed to use it. This contributed to Checkpoint Charlie's mythological status as a meeting place for spies and other shady individuals. Checkpoint Charlie gained its name from the phonetic alphabet; checkpoints ""Alpha"" and ""Bravo"" were at the autobahn checkpoints Helmstedt and Dreilinden respectively. Checkpoint Charlie's atmosphere was not improved at all on 27 Oct 1961 when the two Cold War superpowers chose to face each other down for a day. Soviet and American tanks stood approximately 200&nbsp;m apart, making an already tense situation worse. Now the remains of the Berlin Wall have been moved to permit building, including construction of the American Business Center and other institutions.<br>At the intersection of Zimmerstraße and Friedrichstraße (U-Bahn Kochstraße U6) is the famous ""You Are Leaving the American Sector"" sign. The actual guardhouse from Checkpoint Charlie is now housed at the Allied Museum on Clayallee. For a more interesting exhibit go to the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. This is a private museum with kitschy memorabilia from the Wall and the devices GDR residents used to escape the East (including a tiny submarine!)"
"This museum documents the terror applied by the Nazi regime. Also showing where the headquarters of various Nazi institutions responsible for genocide and other atrocities were throughout Berlin."
"Exhibition hall."
"There are three huge collections housed within this grand building: the Collection of Classical Antiquities, the Museum of Near Eastern Antiquities and the Museum of Islamic Art. The Pergamon Museum was the last museum built on Museumsinsel (Museum Island) and was intended to house the great acquisitions brought to Germany by archaeologists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The museum's best-known attraction is the Pergamonsaal. The Pergamon Altar (165 BC), from the eponymous Asia Minor city-state, is three stories high and served as the entrance gate to an entire complex. It is astounding both because of its size and extremely precise detail, especially in a frieze which shows the gods battling giants. The entire room is the same colour as the building's stone, making the details on the frieze section stand out even more. Facing the stairs, on the left hand side of the room there is a small-scale model of the altar which allows the viewer to see where the frieze segments would have been mounted. A 1:300 scale model of Pergamon city is on the right side of the room. The monumental market door of Milet has just been restored."
"Exhibits include the Egyptian and Prehistory and Early History collections. It houses the famous bust of Nefertiti (the legality of its acquisition is still contested by the Egyptian state which is trying to get it back, so you might want to hurry to see it there)."
"Museum for Pre- And Early History with objects from the Collection of Classical Antiquities in the Neues Museum."
"The main floor houses the antiquities collection in an ongoing exhibit called ""Neue Antike im Alten Museum"" (New Antiquities in the Old Museum). Directly through the front door, entering from the Lustgarten (Pleasure Garden, now under reconstruction), there is a domed rotunda with red and white cameos, Greek-style, with statues of the gods. To reach the Hildesheim silver collection, go to the back of the rotunda, turn left, walk through the long gallery and turn left into a small room at the end."
"Specializes in 19th century painting and sculpture; Monet, Manet, Cézanne, C. David Friedrich and other important 18th and 19th century artists are well-represented."
"The museum’s treasures include the sculpture collection with works of art from the middle ages to the 18th century. The Bode museum is best known for its Byzantine art collection and the coin cabinet."
"The city's Protestant cathedral and the burial place of the Prussian kings. You can climb to the top and get a view of the city."
"Started in the 15th century and finished in the mid-18th century, the baroque palace was the residence of electors, kings and emperors until 1918, when it became a museum. The palace was badly damaged during World War II and later razed in 1950, replaced by the GDR with a modernist ''Palast der Republik''. The ''Palast'' was in turn gradually dismantled at the turn of the century, as it was discovered to contain asbestos and its former function of housing the GDR parliament became obsolete. Berlin has started in June 2013 construction on a new version of its historic Stadtschloss. Now the building is scheduled to open in 2019."
"At 368 metres, the Fernsehturm is Berlin's tallest and indeed EU's second-tallest building, complected between 1965 and 1969. The main function of the building is television broadcasting, but the shiny sphere atop the tower houses a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Berlin Tourist Information point. The viewing platform sits 203 metres above ground, affording views of as much as 42&nbsp;km away and featuring a bar. The ''Sphere'' restaurant at 207 metres rotates at a speed of one full spin per 30 minutes. There are two lifts from the base to the platform and cafe, taking 40 seconds to reach the top, as well as a 986-step staircase. The ''Fernsehturm'' is not accessible to wheelchair users.<br>Not all of the Berliners liked the tower and the overall composition of the Alexanderplatz afforded by the socialist city planners, and they nicknamed the building ""Telespargel"" (""television asparagus""). During certain times of day, sunlight reflecting from the top caused a large cross-shaped light to shine down on the city. Called the ''Rache des Papstes'' (Pope's revenge) by nominally atheist East Berliners, the light-cross was an ironic result of socialist architecture. Rumour has it the architect was deprived of more than his next commission after that fiasco. At night, the Fernsehturm sometimes appears to be shooting light beams from the tower section, giving the impression it's a Death Star à la Star Wars."
"Built in 1969, this 16-ton, communist-era clock is one of Berlin's main meeting points. Each of its 24 sides corresponds to one of Earth's 24 time zones and it has the names of some of the world's most important cities written on it."
"A bronze fountain by Reinhold Begas. It was erected in 1891 as a present from the city of Berlin to the Kaiser. Neptune, trident in hand, presides over the square supported by sea-nymphs with webbed feet carrying him on a seashell. Denizens of the deep (a seal, an alligator, snakes and turtles, among others) spray water at him in homage while languishing mermaids pour water into the fountain, clutching sea-nets overflowing with marine bounty."
"The town hall of Berlin is called so because it is made of red brick, not due to its former political persuasion. There are nice Prussian rooms inside, which are worth a look."
"Gothic church, the second oldest (built in late 13th century) of the historical centre of Berlin. It's the highest church tower of Berlin (about 90 m), but seems rather small beneath the gigantic TV tower. The church tower was built in the late 18th century by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the architect of the Brandenburg Gate."
"The twin buildings of the complex house the Radisson Hotel and the Sea Life Centre. In the Radisson lobby you can have a quick glance at the famous Aquadom, the world's biggest cylindrical aquarium with a built-in elevator. There is no entrance fee for watching, but for taking a trip with the elevator you have to pay the entrance fee for the whole Sea Life Centre."
"Berlin's oldest church (1230) is a 3-nave hall church. It is in the center of an area destroyed by bombs in the war which was then turned into a faux ""old town"" by the East German authorities called Nikolaiviertel. The area is more a hodge-podge of relocated buildings than an authentic reproduction, and the newly-built 1988 apartments that attempt to ""harmonize"" with the older buildings are embarrassing. The church is one of the only structures that was renovated rather than rebuilt. It is best known for a sandstone sculpture called the Spandauer Madonna (1290), but there are other interesting pieces here. When the church was destroyed in 1938 and rebuilt in the 1970s, the communist officials intended to use it as a museum, which did not open until 1987. The museum includes sacred textiles and religious sculpture from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. The Nikolaikirche is the showplace of the Nikolaiviertel, which isn't saying much."
"A museum in Nikolaiviertel dedicated to the Berliner artist Heinrich Zille."
"It is the only hemp museum in Germany; you can see the history of hemp, the culture and use of it. You can see hemp grow. There is a cafe downstairs, with an open WiFi access."
"A museum dedicated to everyday life in communist East Germany. The museum has very relaxed rules and you are allowed to touch and examine almost every object, which adds greatly to the experience."
"This imposing building houses the Federal German Parliament or ""Bundestag"" and was completed in 1894 to meet the need of the newly-unified German Empire of the Kaisers' for a larger parliamentary building. The Reichstag was intended to resemble a Renaissance palace, and its architect, Paul Wallot, dedicated the building to the German people. The massive inscription in front still reads: ""Dem Deutschen Volke"" - 'For the German people'. The Nazi leader Adolf Hitler exploited the fire which gutted the Reichstag building in 1933 by blaming the Communists for the arson and for attempted revolution. There is good evidence to suggest, however, that his followers were actually responsible and that this was a manufactured crisis. When German reunification became a reality, the new republic was proclaimed here at midnight on 2 October 1990. The Reichstag has undergone considerable restoration and alteration, including the addition of a spectacular glass dome designed by the British architect Norman Foster. The Reichstag building is well-known in the art world thanks to Paris-based Bulgarian artist Christo's mammoth 'Wrapped Reichstag' project in 1995. The entire building was swathed in silver cloth for two weeks that summer. You can visit the glass dome or a parliamentary debate on your own or follow along on a guided tour through the building."
"Germany's national centre for contemporary non-European art. The house is a leading centre for the contemporary arts and a venue for projects breaking through artistic boundaries. This architectural landmark was an American contribution to the international building exhibition INTERBAU 1957 as an embodiment of the free exchange of ideas. Colloquially called ''Schwangere Auster'' (Pregnant Oyster)."
"Museum for Contemporary Art located in former Hamburger Bahnhof train station. Big halls filled with artworks made since 1960s. In 2004 Rieckhallen, former Lehrter Bahnhof, was opened and now provides exhibition space for the Friedrich Christian Flick Collection. Free public guided tours (in English): Sa and Su at 12:00."

"Includes the Panoramapunkt, the viewing terrace located 101 metres above ground, accessible by Europe's fastest elevator."
"With an impressive, circus-tent-like roof over its courtyard and remains of the pre-war Hotel Esplanade incorporated into the modern structure."
"The octagonal square right east of Potsdamer Platz was recreated to resemble its pre-war layout, but the buildings are modern rather than historic replicas and much taller than their counterparts from before the war. There is a diverse mix of uses among the buildings, which include the Embassy of Canada."
"designed by Hans Scharoun"
"The Gemäldegalerie contains an astounding array of paintings, including works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Botticelli, Raphael, Titian, Goya, Velasquez and Watteau. The collection contains works from the old Bodemuseum on Museumsinsel in the East, now closed, and the former Gemäldegalerie in Dahlem. Its strong points are German paintings of the 13-16th centuries, Netherlandish painting of the 15th and 16th centuries, Flemish paintings of the 17th century, and miniature paintings of the 16th-19th centuries. In the newer section of the museum, designed by architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler, there is enough space to display 1,150 masterpieces in the main gallery and 350 in the studio gallery - of the almost 2,900 pieces in the European painting collections. Established in 1830, the newly built gallery from 1998 has about 7,000 sq m of exhibition space (a complete tour of the 72 rooms covers almost 2 km)."
"The oldest museum of its kind in Germany which, despite great losses during the World War II, still possesses one of the world's primary collections of European applied art. There are two sections to the collection: one located at the Kulturforum in Tiergarten, the other at Köpenick Palace."
"The largest collection of graphic art in Germany."
"Spectacular building by Mies van der Rohe contains its own collection and temporary exhibitions."

"Often missed by tourists but an absolute must for anyone interested in this part of the city's history. It's a memorial to those who died crossing, so you won't, fortunately, get the tackiness of the Checkpoint Charlie area; instead you will be left with a haunting feeling of what life with the wall may have been really like. The documentation centre across the street on Bernauer Straße is excellent although most of the documentation is in German. The viewing platform gives you a tiny hint of the true scale of the Wall and how terrifying the ""no man's land"" between the two sections of walls must have been. When the documentation centre is closed, both walls can be visited. There is some space between the concrete plates which allow you to look at the area between the walls. There are also several small holes.<br>The Memorial is on Bernauer Straße which itself is a street with a great deal of Wall history: the first recorded Wall-related death - the notorious Peter Fechter case (he bled to death in the ""no-man's-land"" with both sides unwilling or unable to help him) - was here, as was one of the famous tunnels and the famous photograph of the GDR border guard leaping over the barbed wire. Various monuments can be found along the entire length of the street, documenting nearby escape attempts and tunnels; captions are in German, English, French, and Russian. The Memorial itself is a complete section of 4th generation wall - both inside and outside sections, and you can peer through from the east side to see the remains of the electric fence and anti-tank devices in the death strip. It really helps you understand what an incredible feat it was to get from one side to the other -- and why so many died doing it."

The also roast their own coffee which is excellent as well. Not so easy to find though - it is in a courtyard of a building situated roughly in the middle of the quiet Sophienstraße and there is only a small sign outside.

"Good breakfast and playground next to the restaurant."

"Built in 1765, Sarehole Mill is a fine example of one of more than fifty water mills that existed in Birmingham at one time. Matthew Boulton used the Mill for making buttons and for metal rolling until he moved his operations to Soho in 1761. In the late 1890s Sarehole was the childhood haunt of Hobbit author J.R.R. Tolkien, and famously influenced 'The Shire' in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Check the website for special events.

"The MG company, whose name derives from ""Morris Garages"", now owned by the Chinese SAIC concern, is the heir to the rich heritage of British Leyland and BMC. The factory had produced a number of storied Austin and Morris vehicles before becoming the hub for the Rover brand production, as it replaced the former two. In the next chapter of its history, the MG brand in turn was revived and replaced Rover as the fate of the company changed. As MG is not present in most Western countries, many visitors may be unaware that the company is still trading and assembling a new generation of vehicles at the Longbridge plant.<br>The site tours include not only the factory, but also the MG Museum, a preserved office of Lord Austin, the Technical Centre where new MGs are developed and the Sales Centre, where one can get acquainted with the current MG lineup and even have a test drive (should be pre-arranged when booking the tour)."

The church is a Grade II* listed building in the UK."
"Cimpleted in 1966, it is the tallest structure in Birmingham at 152&nbsp;m, and serves solely as the support for some 80 transmission antennas mounted atop it. It has no viewing platform or other accessible floors at all, but it can serve as a landmark and orientation point as it is clearly visible from many parts of town. Its square profile sets it apart from many other similar structures in the world"
"The new ziggurat-shaped library building at Centenary Square was opened in September 2013 to replace the very controversial brutalist Birmingham Central Library in Paradise Circus, which incidentally employs an inverted-ziggurat design and is scheduled to be demolished as of 2014. It is the single largest public library in the UK and one of the largest in the whole of Europe. The project, which involved years of planning and preparation and a major architectural contest, was hailed as the cornerstone of Birmingham's urban revival. The building was designed by the Dutch firm Mecanoo architecten, and took four years to be completed. It includes an intricate facade decoration, despite the very simple form of the building, as well as a number of innovative sustainable solutions. To explore the building take the lift to the top (9th) floor to see the Shakespeare Memorial Room, a fine wooden panelled library, which was originally in the city's library built in 1882. There is also a viewing window to look over the city. There are outside garden spaces on the 7th and 3rd floors which give different city views. The four lower floors house the public library, laid out in an impressive style."
"It is a signature, Grade-I-listed, building for the red-brick-and-terracota Victorian style prevalent in the late 19th century in Birmingham, which lacked natural stone and battled sooting problems due to air pollution. It is also a symbol of modernisation of Birmingham, as it was originally built to house the Central Telephone Exchange for Birmingham, and the logos of the Bell-Edison company are still visible within the building. As the telephone exchange relocated many decades ago, the building now houses office and a bar."

"The Curzon Street station was the original main railway station of Birmingham, offering connections to London since 1838 and to Liverpool and Manchester since 1839. It was quickly overshadowed by the original Birmingham New Street station built in 1854, and saw less and less traffic ever since, becoming a goods station only in the 20th century, before being put completely out of use in 1996 with its tracks later dismantled.<br>The only surviving remainder is the solitary small station entrance building, which is Grade I listed and quite elegant in form. As of 2014, it stands next to an open plot of land resulting from the removal of station tracks, platforms and other infrastructure, which is awaiting redevelopment. The building is not open for visiting and only occasionally hosts arts events and such."
"The Rotunda is the only surviving part of the original Bull Ring centre, originally devised as a 25-storey office building in a round shape, from which it dervies its name. In many ways, it was a groundbreaking and daring engineering and architectural feat when it was constructed in the 1960s, and because of its significance it became Grade II listed. In the 2000s, as the Bullring centre was redeveloped, the Rotunda was thoroughly refurbished into a residential tower with 232 luxury apartments. Those on floors 19 and 20 are available for short term stays via Staying Cool, who operates them. The building is not accessible to the public."

The building itself is Grade I listed."
"A prime example of Birmingham's red-brick-and-terracota architecture, covered not only with deep red terracota on the outside, but also with rich terracota decorations on the inside.

"The hall was built in 1904 in a similar red-brick-and-terracota style to the Victoria Law Courts it faces. It is distinguished by its tall tower.

"A large modern multiplex showing recent mainstream films."
"Cinema showing mainstream films, near to Bullring shopping centre and New Street station. You can't really call it much of a multiplex. It is a 1930s building with very few screens and the seats are so close together your legs hurt after the advertisements."
"Multiplex within the Star City entertainment complex north east of the town center (which also boasts restaurants, bars, nightclubs, bowling and a large casino). The cinema offers 24 screens, including 3 gold class screens with larger, more comfortable seats, at-seat service, free popcorn and a bar."

"A historic shopping arcade with painted plafonds and a potpourri of specialist premises right next to the New Street station."

"Fairly small cafe with a good range of organic and vegetarian foods. Excellent in the summer, as it's (unsurprisingly) right on the canalside."
"Authentic Edwardian cafe in the heart of the museum. The food is a lot better than the price suggests."
"Absolutely excellent cafes, big helpings not shy on the cheese, garlic mayonnaise and chilli sauce if you were to order them. Excellent reputation for their roasted vegetables or jacket potatoes."

"Picturesque area in the middle of a busy and bustling part of Birmingham. Quality vegetarian options and excellent service. This is one of those places that, in time, will only get better."
"Upmarket Italian place, can be a bit crowded."
"Catering to both British and expatriate Chinese communities the food is of good quality, and the service unobtrusive (you may have to wave for attention). Though they do have plates, ask to keep your bowls and chopsticks for a more authentic experience. Try the hot Chinese tea, the spring rolls (with spicy dipping sauce) or the vegetarian lettuce wrapped to start, the side of Shangri-la noodles (fried, dry with various meats), and the sizzling steak (in strips, with sauce and vegetables). It will be ample for two."
"Contemporary Oriental surroundings. Wide range of Thai dishes."
"Home-style Chinese cooking, popular with the local Chinese community. Clean and bright inside with trendy decor."
"Birmingham's restaurant of the Wagamama chain, tidy and minimal inside with a good, varied noodle menu. Specials change frequently and there are a few good vegetarian dishes. Can get busy, with a typical wait from 10-15 minutes during peak shopping times."
"Japanese, surprisingly given the name. Fluorescent, authentic, accommodating, great."
"3-course pre-concert table d'hôte menu."
"Ideal venue for both drinking and dining with a fabulous reputation for food. Quality steaks, fresh fish, set price menu and superb wine list. The bar is vibrant every weekend and is open to 1AM. It's a stylish place but friendly and attracts a great mix of people."

"Fresh seasonal produce with an unpretentious feel. Michelin Star quality without the price."

"Indian restaurant, pretty good you can bring your own wine. They give you big discount."
"Pretty Indian restaurant. You will have about 5 waiters behind your back if you eat there."

"Name says it all."
"Quiet and comfortable pub, in the Gun quarter."
"Large city centre pub belonging to the Wetherspoon chain."

"Situated out of the rear of the Mailbox complex, has great traditional blue tiled exterior."
"Popular venue in the financial part of town, great food available every day. Known for quality pub food from local suppliers."

"Superbly decorated pub in a former bank, Grade II listed. Multi-award winning establishment. Sells mainly Fullers' brand."
"Single bar with large-screen TV. The pub is popular with office workers."
"A great place to watch live sport and the venue of the best quiz night in Birmingham every Thursday night. It's just £1 to enter and there's no limit on the size of the teams. A great night out for seasoned quiz-goers and first-timers alike. Homemade pizzas and a sausage selection giving a fresh choice every day, also has two for one offers every weekday. Great place for traditional ales and a Cask Marque award winner."

"Part of the eponymous Wetherspoon chain. Also handy for International Convention Centre, art gallery and museum."
"Supposedly a noodle bar, as evidence by a small noodle based menu. Really this is just a pretty decent bar. It stocks the standard beers and drinks as well as a number of rarer Asian beers. Has a number of extremely comfortable sofas."
"One of the best, but also one of the most pretentious clubs in Birmingham. Its not cheap but is still the place to be seen. The dress code here is very hard to define, they want ""cool""."
"Chain vodka bar. A cut above the normal broad street crowd, though it does get crowded. Great range of Vodka's."
"Big 3 room club, with a variety of music. Great for kids. Over 23's will feel ancient in here."

"Next to St Peter's Church, this cosy and quiet pub gets busy because of its attraction."
"Cosy, moderately priced, popular with medical and nursing students."
"An odd V shaped pub as the name suggests on the junction of the High Street and Vivian Road. A really nice pub sells some real ales and good selection of lagers. Sells good pub grub as well."

"The new super club boasts 5+ bars, 2 huge dance floors, and a roof top seating area, all new within the last 2 years. An amazing experience, if a little expensive on popular nights. A good night to go is a Wednesday."

"Birmingham's only independent hostel features a central location only streets from The Bull Ring, and next to the nightclubs of Digbeth. Beds in a shared dorm can be found for as little as £9 if you've got a sharp eye out and both breakfast and various foods in the evening are included, making it the West Midlands only half-board hostel. It is in the oldest part of the city, right near where the original manor house once stood. The area can look a little uninviting (this is what you will find outside the very centre of this industrial city), but the hostel makes up for it by being socially inviting (films/football can be watched and they have a Wii, playstation and xbox) and, as mentioned, still being close to The Bull Ring. They offer nightly events such as quiz night, beer tasting, movie nights and disco, and the common room is probably the best around."
"Less than a 10 minute walk to the centre, Hatters Birmingham have upped the norm in hostel accommodation boasting all ensuite rooms and, finally, after eight long months of waiting (yet advertising that it was there) they've got a common room. Beds start from £14.50 and includes bed linen & a free light breakfast which is served all day"
"For groups looking for accommodation in the scenic Lickey Hills, but with easy access to the centre."
"If you are travelling by car and on a budget, Campanile is your friend wherever you go - the rooms could not be more simple, but the locations are usually very convenient at motorway junctions. In Birmingham, it is north of town, where the A4540 ringroad meets the A38, which goes straight into the city, and has the added benefit of being located over the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal lock."
"Comfort Inn is a brand of non-standardized properties where price often trumps modern comforts, and this hotel is no exception. It also boasts a location right in front of the New Street station."
"Contemporary 3 star hotel offering 285 stylish rooms, free WiFi and complimentary breakfast."
"The new Hampton brings some colourfulness to Birmingham's economy hotel market, merging new with old as it is located in a building dating back to 1910. Its name honestly describes its location northwest of the city centre."
"Where comfort meets great value rates, all guests receive free WiFi in public areas and a complimentary breakfast to set you up for your day."
"The tall tower with 224 rooms has relatively large common areas and everything expected of a Holiday Inn Express, including free WiFi and breakfast included in the room price. It replaces the older property which now became the ibis Styles."
"The slightly out-of-town ibis is more of an option for motorists, situated at a large roundabout of the A45 circling the city. It is one of the older ibis hotels in the UK."
"A standard and slightly dated ibis hotel in the very centre of the city"
"This is an older ibis whose suburban style belies its location close to the business district and the Holloway Circus evoked in the name."
"Offering perhaps the cheapest hotel stays in Birmingham, the ibis Budget is a chain hotel optimized for low costs, with very simply appointed rooms with just enough space."
"Located east of the core city centre on Lionel Street, it is a former Holiday Inn Express property that became and ibis Styles after some very light refreshment. As in all ibis Styles, breakfasts and free WiFi are included in the room price, which can be very attractive, compensating for the less central location."
"Despite the imposing Victorian presence, this hotel in the southeastern corner of Birmingham offers very attractive rates. This comes not only at the expense of a relatively remote location, but also standards of the worn rooms, which fall deeply behind the expectations one might have experiencing the common areas."
"As typical as a Premier Inn gets, it is situated in a nondescript 1970s building with simple rooms - but just around the corner from to the St. Phillip's cathedral."
"There is no shortage of Premier Inns in Birmingham. This one is next to the New Street railway station."
"This Premier Inn serves the ICC and faces a canal."
"There is nothing ""central"" about this motel-style Premier Inn at the junction of M38 and M4045, which faces a similar Campanile across the canal, but if you are a motorist, you will enjoy its convenient location and free parking."
"The Premier Inn at Brindley Place is the chain's most up-to-date property, with a marked difference in fittings over the other ones in town."
"Selly Park (''close to the university''). Offers mid-range B&B in a quiet environment within 10 minutes walk from the university."

"An old Holiday Inn in an office/commercial area of the centre"
"A huge and hotel in a concrete block, catering to business visitors of the ICC. Enjoys solid reputation despite a complete lack of charm."
"The property brands itself as a boutique hotel, where postmodern common space appointments are meant to make up for the ultrasmall (7 sqm) cabins that serve as ensuite rooms."
"The familiar white-and-light-wood Novotel rooms await in what is not quite the centre, but rather the Brindleyplace complex."
"This relatively new mid-range property is swamped in pentahotel's hallmark purple lighting and entices with a potpourri of postmodern appointments. Both standard and ""comfort"" rooms are small (12 sqm)"
"The Ramada is a part of the Mailbox multi-use complex, where you will find multiple restaurants, shopping opportunities and service outlets. The hotel faces a canal, which provides for nice views and ambiance, but the rooms are in dire need of redecoration."
"A rare occurrence of IHG's extended-stay brand outside of North America, the Staybridge Suites Birmingham offers studios and apartments with kitchenettes and other long-stay facilities, including on-site gym. Breakfasts are included in room rates."
"Near the International Convention Centre, National Indoor Arena and the Bull Ring Shopping Centre."
"The conservatively-styled - and little outdated - Thistle faces St. Chad's Cathedral over a busy thoroughfare."
"As nondescript as a Crowne Plaza gets, this hotel was originally built to serve the ICC next door. Despite having been updated since, it still has a somewhat sombre presence."
"Near Birmingham Airport."

"This is what most people are here for. Not only is it a lovely stretch of powdery white sand against azure water, it's also the commercial center of the island. The long beach is divided into three sections, Station 1, Station 2, and Station 3. Station 1 is the northernmost and has the widest beachfront, where prime hotels and resorts are located. Accommodations are pricier, but quality is generally the best as well. Station 2 is the commercial and geographical center of white beach.  This is the center of it all for shopping, eating, partying, and etc.  That said, the beach here is also the most crowded, and the area the nosiest.  Station 3 is the southernmost section;  quieter than station 2, it is the least developed, and also the lowest priced.  All of White Beach from  the northernmost tip of Station 1 to the southernmost of Station 3 (~4&nbsp;km) is open to the public, so one can relax and/or swim wherever they like, regardless of hotel location.  :In every station, there are two lifeguards patrolling  on foot equipped with whistle, life buoy and hand-held radio. The boat station 2 is the lifeguard and rescue command center."
"A quiet stretch of white sand along the northern tip of the island, Puka Beach is an image of what most people expect on a tropical island: white sand, azure water, and relatively empty. This is where locals gather the small puka shells for some of the jewelry that is sold on the island so expect the sand to be more coarse than on White Beach. The water tends to be a little rougher on this side of the island but it is much quieter.  Similarly, there are fewer services—there are only a couple of restaurants, but you likely won't have a problem getting a cold drink or an ice cream as there are a few vendors that patrol the beach. The main road in Boracay terminates at Puka Beach therefore you'll be able to hire a tricycle to get there in less than 10–15 minutes from central White Beach. Make sure you arrange a pickup if it is a quiet day and no tricycles are hanging around the beach. Most people experience Puka as one of their sailboat or banca stops during a day trip. This is a good spot for a picnic, but be sure to bring your trash home with you."
"This is a quiet little cove just north of Diniwid Beach, where you can enjoy swimming, snorkeling and dining in a relaxed, peaceful environment. There are some fantastic views from the clifftop restaurant. Baling Hai is often included as a stop-off on an island boat tour."
"Come there on a windy days to see kiteboarders doing high jumps and crazy tricks."
"One will see in several tour guides and maps of Boracay something called the Bat Cave, which houses many small insectivorous bats (the larger fruit bats roost in the trees on the hillside above Punta Bunga Beach), and locals will be more than happy to accompany you there for a fee, or ""tip"". The cave is on the western-end of the island and down several dirt roads. The guide will then take you on a short hike through the forest to the mouth of a cave, which drops down at a very steep angle. The mouth of the cave is littered with large boulders, and is extremely difficult to enter and walk down. There is no visible path, no handrail, and the stones are extremely slippery with slime and bat guano, as well as extremely dangerous, since the cave is at such an extreme angle. Also, the air inside the cave is very warm and humid, and in addition to the amount of guano, is very difficult to breathe. Additionally, several snakes live inside the cave. Caution should be taken by those visiting and entering the cave. There are bats in the cave, but down at the bottom of it in the dark, and unless you have a flashlight or are there at dusk, you won't see them. The ceiling of the cave is interesting, however, with multiple, small stalactites. Just nearby, you can find another cave, called ""crystal"" cave which has a lot of stalactites and a hole on the opposite site of the entrance, from which you can watch out to the sea if you dare to climb up to it. You will have to pay 50P entry-fee to visit both caves on behalf of the family that owns the land, in addition to paying your guide. Visiting both caves can cost up to 2500P for the guide, but this is the ""rich tourist price"", so try to bargain if you like."

Visitors can reach Ariel’s Point by purchasing tickets at Ariel's House (along the White Beach in front of the Boracay Beach Club) before 11AM on the day of departure."
"Take a parasailing tour around the island, to explore quiet beaches and snorkel sites. Ask your crew to organize a romantic BBQ on the beach with fresh grilled seafood, if you like. Cruise back at sunset to experience breathtaking views."
"It is worth hiring motorbikes or scooters out to explore the island, as there are other beautiful beaches on the other side of the island that are even better for snorkeling that will be completely deserted. Hire them for a couple of days and you should get a discount. The roads are a bit dodgy, and some are still being constructed, but it's a good laugh and better than plunking yourself on a patch of white sand and seeing nothing."

You can buy fresh seafood, etc., right near the stores, then have the stores cook it for you however you like. For example, you can get crabs for ₱400 for 1 kilo opposed to buying in restaurants that charge ₱200 per 100 grams. However, most of the seller are quite pushy and anyone buying needs to be prepared to bargain hard to get a good deal."

"A very good budget eatery. Local dishes, meat and seafood dishes, omeletes and excellent sandwiches are on offer. Most meals cost around ₱120 and are all cooked fresh. If you are around between 11AM and 2PM you get a free drink of iced lemon tea with every rice meal."

The food is fairly plain but well priced, and the drinks menu is about the same. Excellent live blues acts Sunday afternoon and evenings from Wednesday to Saturday are the main reason to visit."
"Great cocktails, and a good selection of spirits and bottled drinks. The music here is primarily funk and hip-hop, with live DJs on the weekend and during the latter half of the week. The beer garden out the front is a great spot to relax in the shade on a hot day and meet some locals. The crowd tends to be a lot thicker and drunker on Saturday nights, however."
"Friendly staff, live music most evenings and a decent array of cocktails. The beer garden at the back is a nice spot to relax, but is often crowded. Excellent spot for a light meal."
"Calls itself a ""boutique bar for everyone"". Quite small inside, so if you're not there early you will probably miss out on a seat to 'hipper than thou' types. Decent selection of beers at the average price, ever-changing seasonal cocktail menu."

"The high speed Thalys train connects Brussels with Cologne (1h52), Paris (1h20) and Amsterdam (2h00). It is much cheaper to book further in advance.

"Surrounded by the city tower and a range of beautiful 300 year old buildings. In the evening, surrounded by bright lumination, it is simply ravishing. Some evenings a music and light show is provided with the buildings serving as a canvas. Have a ""gaufre de Liège-Luikse wafel"" here (Belgian waffle with caramelized sugar)—the best ones are available from the little shops off the northeast corner of the Grand Place-Grote Markt. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site."
"Just a short walk from the Grand Place-Grote Markt is the Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue thought to represent the ""irreverent spirit"" of Brussels. This is a statue of a child urinating into a pool. Belgians have created hundreds of outfits for this statue. There are many stories of the statue's origins. It is believed to have been inspired by a child who, while in a tree, found a special way to drive away invading troops. Another story goes that a father was missing his child and made a declaration to the city that when he found him he would build a statue of him, doing whatever it was that he was doing. It has also been said a witch turned him to stone for peeing on her property. Yet another story goes that Brussels was under siege and enemies had planted explosives in the city; a boy saw the lit fuse and urinated on it, preventing the explosives from blowing up thus saving the city. The most likely scenario is that it was the location of the market for urine, which was used for its ammonia content to tan leathers. None are definitively true. In 1747, Louis XV's soldiers stole the statue, upsetting many of the city's residents. Louis XV made it up to the city by giving the statue a medal of honor (so that he must be saluted when French soldiers pass by) and by giving him an outfit. He now gets dressed up on special occasions."
"Definitely check out the '''Arc de Triomphe-Triomfboog''' on the east side of town. It's in the Parc du Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark. It is possible to go up to the terrasse above the arch, from where you'll have a good view of the city. Entry is through the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History and is free. Take Metro line 1 east, exit Schuman and walk east or exit Mérode and walk west."
"Unavoidable icon of Brussels and Belgium, important place for international tourism, unique creation in the history of architecture and emblematic vestige of the World Fair in Brussels (Expo 58) the Atomium continues to embody its ideas of the future and universality, half a century later. In its cultural programme it carries on the debate of 1958: What kind of future do we want for tomorrow? Our happiness depends on what? Its recent renovation in 2006 gave its original brightness back, and the new equipments guarantee its durability. Five of the nine spheres are open to the public (so they say, but not really true). One of them is housing a permanent exhibition dedicated to Expo 58 (just some small models of some countries pavilions). Another sphere is dedicated to temporary exhibitions with scientific themes (often closed when there is no exhibition). The upper sphere offers spectacular views of the city of Brussels. When the sky is clear, the view reaches till Antwerp. There is a ""kids zone"" sphere which staff will happily direct you to even though you can never go in, it is only open to touring schoolchildren, and there is nothing inside except places for kids to sleep. In truth there are only three spheres: the top (restaurant), middle (snack bar) and bottom; the only thing to see really is the view; rather expensive at €11. The restaurant, also situated at the top, is open every day till 11PM At night, the nine spheres are lit up with 2,970 lights that offer a very special show. To enrich your visit: audioguides in EN (but also in F, NL, ES, IT and RU) are available at the cash desk for €2. Visio-guides are also available (€2) for the deaf and hard of hearing people. In August 2010, a zip-line was available from the top of the tallest sphere (102m); the ""Death Ride"" (run by former members of the Belgian Special Services) is a separate €25, and offers a rather unique view of the insides of the Atomium and the surrounding city."
"Larger than St. Peter's basilica in Rome, it cost 45 million Belgian Francs to construct in 1866."
"The fifth biggest church in the world, with an impressive interior and an amazing view over Brussels and its surroundings."
"Royal Palace with a park out front."
"Former stock market building. Locals like to sit on the steps, sometimes with fries. A local restaurant owner has proposed turning the unused building into a beer hall."
"Hosts a set of scale models of famous European structures."
"Famous metro station named after Belgian WWI air ace Edmond Thieffry. Contains some interesting sculptures of modern art."
"Also referred to as Unity in Peace, this sculpture symbolises peace through European integration, while at the same time aiming to demonstrate the motto of the European Union (EU), United in Diversity. It is located in the garden of Convent Van Maerlant (the library of the European Commission) Van Maerlant street, in the European Quarter of Brussels."
"Just like Antwerp and Amsterdam, Brussels also has its own Red Light District. It is located mainly in Rue d'Aerschot/ Aarschotstraat, behind the North Train Station. Contrary to The Netherlands, prostitution is NOT legal in Belgium, they exploit a loophole in the local legislation presenting brothels as ""bars"". Do not expect to actually get a drink in there though. Despite heavy police presence, it still remains a fairly seedy area, not the kind of place where you'd want to walk alone at night."
"Part of the '''Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire (MRAH) - Koninklijke Musea voor Kunst en Geschiedenis (KMKG)''' (Royal Museums of Art and History) group of museums. This museum has an important collection of art objects from different civilizations from all over the world. The museum was founded in 1835 and was located in the Hallepoort/Porte de Hal, one of the last remaining medieval city gates of Brussels. The gate is still operated as a separate museum by the same museum foundation."
"Features both historical art and modern art in the one building. In a vast museum of several buildings, this complex combines the Musée d'Art Ancien-Museum voor Oude Kunst and the Musée d'Art Moderne-Museum voor Moderne Kunst under one roof (connected by a passage). The collection shows off works, most of them Belgian, from the 14th to the 20th century, starting in the historical section, with Hans Memling's portraits from the late 15th century, which are marked by sharp lifelike details, works by Hiëronymus Bosch, and Lucas Cranach's Adam and Eve. You should particularly seek out the subsequent rooms featuring Pieter Brueghel, including his Adoration of the Magi. Don't miss his unusual Fall of the Rebel Angels, with grotesque faces and beasts. But don't fear, many of Brueghel's paintings, like those depicting Flemish village life, are of a less fiery nature. Later artists represented include Rubens, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt. Next door, in a circular building connected to the main entrance, the modern art section has an emphasis on underground works - if only because the museum's eight floors are all below ground level. The collection includes works by van Gogh, Matisse, Dalí, Tanguy, Ernst, Chagall, Miró, and local boys Magritte, Delvaux, De Braekeleer and Permeke. Don't miss David's famous ""Death of Marat."""
"Intriguing complex of three buildings in the Laaken area, not far from the Atomium. They comprise a Japanese tower, a Chinese pavilion, and a museum of Japanese art. The architecture and decor may seem over the top to today's tastes, but there are some outstanding examples of Chinese export porcelain, and rotating exhibitions of Japanese artefacts from the Edo period (1600-1868)."
"Features Belgium's history. Before it became a museum, the former 18th century luxury hotel was a royal residence."
"The museum is well-known for its famous collection of iguanodons (dinosaurs discovered in a coal-mine in Belgium). The dinosaur collection has been refreshed in October 2007 and includes discovery activities for the children. The other parts of the museum are also interesting, as an exhibit of all animals that live in our houses and a collection of mammals."
"The home of noted Belgian ''Art Nouveau'' architect and designer Victor Horta. Seeing where he lived and worked is a great way to get an introduction to the art nouveau style in Brussels. It is one of four Horta works to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It can be very busy on rainy Sundays and the queue is outside, so don't forget your umbrella."
"The Museum is home to some truly remarkable collections. Its collection of ethnographic objects from Central Africa is in fact the only one of its kind in the world. It also contains the entire archives of Henry Morton Stanley which are of great historical value. The actual state of the museum makes it some kind of ""museum in the museum"" Apart the new (or newish) sections about the Congo River and the colonial period (with some ambiguous statements about the Belgian role), the structure of the museum seems to have been ""frozen"" 50 years ago. Casing, labels (largely almost nonexistent or vanished), (dis)organization of the collection in homogenous topics, especially in the ethnographic section, reflect those of a museum conceived a century ago and never updated since. Labels, where available, are in Dutch and French only in the permanent exhibition. In fact, '''the museum is closed''' to mend these issues and will reopen after major renovations of buildings and exhibitions about 2017. The audio-guided farewell tour ""Uncensored"" (€7, including permanent exhibition access) temporary exhibition (largely embedded inside the permanent exhibition tour) digs deep in the history of the museum. In some ways, it is a pity that in the future we will get a more enjoyable and interesting museum, but we will soon loose this unique remainder of the old age of museums."
"Located in Europe's earliest Shopping-Mall (a shiny Jugendstil/Art Nouveau palace). There is a permanent exposition featuring the early beginning of comics as well as it's development. There is enough room for other varying expositions. The bookshop at the ground floor sells many different comics. A readers' library operates on the ground floor, where, for a low entrance fee, you can read many different comic books and buy fries."
"A history of film-making."
"Automobiles from the dawn of the motoring age to 1970s including the earliest Mercedes, Renaults, BMW Isettas, Tatras, Ford T-birds, even a jeepney from the Philippines."
"The Belgian Army Museum and Museum of Military History occupies the north wing of the Palais Cinquantenaire. It provides an overview of the development of military technology and of the major campaigns fought on Belgian soil. The museum has three principal sections: Belgian military history (documents, uniforms and weaponry from the Middle Ages to the present day, including a most comprehensive collection of medieval arms and armor); the Armored Vehicle Hall with artillery, tanks etc. from the two World Wars; and the Air Section (Brussels Air Museum) with a collection of aircraft from World War I onwards. The Brussels Air Museum's high point is its collection of original aircraft from World War I."
"The museum houses more than 7000 instruments, from all times and all over the world. The museum’s reputation is built on its extraordinary collection. The exhibits are displayed on four different floors featuring a wide range of instruments from all time periods and areas of the world. The MIM is a place to experience music. An infrared headphone system allows each visitor to enjoy the sound and melodies played by the instruments presented. The restaurant on the roof is also famous because of its panoramic view over Brussles. You need around 3 or 4 hours to really enjoy the whole museum, make sure you have enough time! The ornate façade of the building was decorated as such to promote the work of local tradesman and to protest the loss of jobs due to automation."
"This museum is dedicated to the life and art of the Belgian artist René Magritte. It holds a multidisciplinary collection containing more than 200 of Magritte's works."

"The last traditional gueuze/lambic brewery in Brussels, Cantillon still uses natural yeast fermentation (not injected like almost every other beer). The lambics and gueuzes are made in original style with no sweetners or syrups added. Only 100% bio (organic) and natural fruits are used creating a distinctly sour drink. This museum-esque atmosphere is still a functioning brewery. The tour includes two small glasses of lambic and gueuze, and if you've never had a natural beer before, then you will be (pleasantly) surprised by the taste. An absolute must for beer lovers, save room in your luggage to take bottles back with you!"
"A museum that is dedicated to the art of binding books, with one of the most prestigious bookbinding collections in the world. Quite interesting. A discovery of forgotten discipline. Amazing use of materials, that unexpectedly gives room to innovation."
"Old trams are regularly used to link the museum to one of Brussels suburbs, Tervuren, through a very nice wooded area. The trip is especially pleasant on a sunny day. From the end station in Tervuren you can go to a nearby old train station that has been converted to a bar and small restaurant named Spoorloos (literally ""without tracks"")."
"Several turn-of-the-century houses and manors can still be seen today, such as the '''Stoclet/Stokkel House''', a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was built between 1905 and 1909 on a design by Josef Hoffmann and contains mosaics and paintings by Gustav Klimt."
"The benedictine abbey was built as a priory to women in the 12th century and expanded many times in the following century as it gained importance. The downfall came in the 18th century, when a fire ravaged the convent and later the aftermath of the French Revolution led to its suppression. The remaining building complex has been restored in the 1960s and serves now a community centre."

A Korean Ultraman rip-off, a Pakistani documentary or a bleak Chilean cinema vérité flick? Only at Nova. ''Nova Cinema, 3 rue Arenberg-Arenbergstraat''."
"An arthouse cinema and exhibition venue located within the Saint Hubertus Galleries. ''Cinéma Galeries, 26 Galerie de la Reine - Koninginnegalerij''."
"Is part of the Centre for Fine Arts and features a carefully chosen selection of contemporary and classic arthouse films. The best thing about this isn't just the building (due to be restored soon) but also the fact that the entrance fee is cheap. So if you can't live without your dose of Werner Herzog or Jan Svankmajer fret not - this place won't cost you an arm and a leg. ''Royal Film Museum, 9 Rue Baron Horta - Baron Hortastraat''."

"maze-like, second-hand bookshop with huge selection of used books at bargain prices. A bookworm's haven."
"Tasty fries with a large collection of sauces situated on a square close to the European Parliament. You can eat your fries (''frites'') in one of the several bars/cafés that carries the sign ''frites acceptés''. Vegetarians be careful. Fries are cooked in Beef fat. Although this place has a very good reputation which can be guessed from the long line of people waiting to be served, purists will tell you that is certainly not the best place in town to get your fries."
"Another personal choice for the best ''frites'' in Brussels: the big chunks of potato, fried golden, and served with the usual dazzling array of sauces."
"Golden and crispy frites just the way they should be. This exterior of this fritkot also serves as mini-museum with several tracts, articles and other literature on the fronts and sides of the shack on the good ol' Belgian frite."
"All natural frites with the widest selection of sauces available. It's open almost 24/7 and is a favourite among locals."
"A quirky combination of old and new, the menu ranges all over the place but the reason people flock here is the selection of over 30 sweet and savoury pies (''tartes''). A slice big enough for a meal, served with salad, costs €7-7.50. Also current special of cafe & slice of pie for €5."
"3 shops: Flagey (Chaussee de Vleurgat-Vleurgatsesteenweg 5), Chatelain/Kastelein (Rue du Page-Edelknaapstraat 5) and Place Jourdan/Jourdanplein. Small pizzeria for eat-in (bar-style seating) or takeaway, sold by weight. Delicious crunchy base and some unusual toppings (one was spicy with walnuts, very tasty). Long queues but speedy service, deals available for pizza + drinks."
"The fantastic crepes and friendly service makes up for the ordinary decor and just around the corner from the Arc de Triomphe-Triomfboog."
"The gentlemen running the place speak a little bit of English and serve the best donar kebap and pizza in the neighborhood. The #39-Pizza Porte De Halle is probably their best pizza. Free delivery on orders over €10."
"Crazy tapas, sensible prices. Some tapas include miniaturised Belgian favourites as well as the usual Spanish suspects."
"Basic honest food, including some very decent moules. Crowded, although worth the wait."
"Rue des Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat 18. Now franchised into France as well, this is the original and while it's huge and looks like a tourist trap, the ''moules'' are excellent and it's packed every day. Moules, beer and a starter will set you back €25, and kids eat for free."
"Specializes in fresh and tasty seafood."
"A former butcher shop, locals flock here for some of the best ''moules'' in town, sold by the kilo (figure on €24) and served up in half a dozen ways. Also serves the full range of other Brussels favorites."
"Has cheap and decent food."
"This tiny restaurant (approx. 14 seats) looks like a violin workshop, so you sit next to all the tools and half finished violins. Unlike other Belgian restaurants. The menu is small but really delicious. The atmosphere is informal and friendly."
"Its crowd is mostly made out of young couples or students. Rich choice of beer, with more than 50 varieties on the menu, and good quality of food."
"Well-made typical Belgian fare.  Try the ''carbonnades à la flamande'' (Flemish beef stew) & mussels.  Note that this place can feel cramped when full of diners."
"Just off the Grote Markt with reasonable prices and excellent food. Seems to be popular among the locals without full of tourists."
"Some very tasty Thai and Vietnamese dishes served in a fine decor."
"Its exterior and misleading name belie a great range of individually cooked Indian food. Get to know the owner and he'll treat you like an old friend."
"The restaurant is very popular among the Euroworkers and business types common in Brussels and serves good Thai food. It can get crowded and is often noisy but is well worth a try."
"A small bistro that really gets busy after 19:00.  Very good seafood.  The handwritten menu can throw foreigners off, but everything on the menu(s) are top notch."
"An authentic old bistro, with a charming kitsch decor. Very good fish."
"For real Belgian home cooking. Terrace in the summer."
"Offers quality food, especially its steak at acceptable prices. The menu is in Dutch and French which can cause difficulty in deciphering the specialties."
"Innovative southern French cuisine at affordable prices."
"Rue Lesbroussart-Lesbroussartstraat 62, Ixelles-Elsene. French-Japanese fusion cuisine in a modern decor. The chef has worked for prestigious restaurants in Paris. Reasonable prices."
"''Rue du Fossé aux Loups-Wolvengracht 32''. A restaurant within an old, restored bank building. Has an oyster bar, gorgeous bathrooms (with strange stall doors), and a cigar bar housed in the old bank vaults. A good looking younger crowd seem to enjoy this place, and don't miss the offbeat restrooms."
"A classic fish restaurant. Very fresh fish and good old traditional cooking."
"Classic Michelin-starred restaurant."
"''Justitiepaleis, de Wynantsstraat 21'', closed Tu. Upmarket and stylish Thai restaurant found just behind the Palais de Justice and better than most food found in Thailand."
"One of the most famous restaurants in Brussels, situated on Grand Place. Beautiful old building, but too much of a tourist trap.  And even after a €200 dinner, you will get charged €0.50 to visit the toilet."
"A very nice vegetarian buffet Monday till Saturday from 19 till 21h. Chaussée d'Ixelles-Elsenesteenweg 329."
"An organic/vegetarian shop annex restaurant, closed on Saturday and Sunday. Rue de Livourne-Livornostraat 109."
"L'Element Terre features an eclectic menu and wonderful, attentive service. Chaussée de Waterloo-Waterloosesteenweg 465."
"100% vegan, organic, and gluten-free restaurant in central Brussels"
"This is a place with a true ""atmosphere"", wooden chairs and tables, big old wooden bar, a crowd that reflects the diversity of Saint-Gilles. Everybody is welcome and come as you are. This is a bar that just oozes human warmth and a comfortable ambiance. When the sunny days are coming, the terrace is one of the best in Saint-Gilles."
"Serves a typical Brussels product this slightly sweetened Lambic beer, white beer based on Lambic, Kriek Lambic and so on. The entrance is not that easy to find."
"Rue Montagne-aux-Herbes Potagères-Bergstraat 7. This is the Brussels cafe par excellence. Opened since 1927, the decor remains unchanged but still retains its charm. A warm welcome greets the eclectic clientile of which La Mort remains a firm favorite."
"Has an impressive selection of beers, including some extremely hard to find beers. Examples of rare beers they have in stock, are Lam Gods (a delicious beer brewed from figs) and the rarest of the Trappist beers, winner of the Beer of the Year 2005, Westvleteren. Also offers meals with beer as an ingredient."
"A stylish, friendly internet cafe in the center of Brussels. Offering high speed internet access, occasional live music/DJ, latest movies shown on video screens around the bar, regular art exhibitions. Gay friendly space with women's night every Wednesday from 8PM."
"Right across from Delirium Cafe, famous for its absinthe."
"Rue Pont de la Carpe-Karperbrugstraat 7. A relaxed blues/rock bar in St Gery area. Excellent place for a beer or five."
"St Katelijnestraat-Rue St. Catherine 42. A large proper brown bar with walls covered in dark wood and mirrors. Lots of young people from the neighborhood, cool music and a decent Malt whiskey selection."
"Right in the centre of Brussels within a five-minute walk of the Grand Place. This bar is all about the beer, even holding the 2004 Guinness world record for most beers available with 2,004 beers in 2004 (now 3,162 beers, according to their website)! Popular among foreigners. There are some smoke-free areas. Also next door are three different bars specialising in rum, tequila, and absinthe."
"Has a huge list of different beers, with several hundred obscure beers not likely found anywhere else. This cafe is one of the last remaining old-fashioned '''brown cafes''' in Brussels."
"Another wood-panelled brown cafe where the only sound is the sound of the chess pieces on the chess board. Shh!"
"Something of an institution in hip Saint-Gilles. Under the watchful eye of the portly, bearded deep-voiced owner, hipsters, starving artists and local poodle-brandishing ladies mingle and drink endless beers and coffees. A beautiful woodwork football tableau shows the scores of some long lost second and third division teams from yesteryear."
"A traditional café where time has come to a stop. Also offers some simple meals. Don't forget to visit the bathroom, with the original tiles and porcelain."
"A bar with a strong selection of beer, Edgar Allen Poe themed, hence the name (The Raven). Known for the clientele who dance on the tables all around the bar. Reasonably priced, well trafficked."
"One of the very few hip ''and'' non-smoking bars in Brussels. Dansaert street."
"This prestige location, nestling in the heart of the Louise district in Brussels, offers a new style of Lounge Bar – Restaurant entirely dedicated to the well-being of its guests. The service, the musical atmosphere and the lighting… everything has been carefully thought out to offer a unique experience depending on the time of day: if the client chooses a table at midday, he will discover a totally different Crystal Lounge from the one he would find sitting at the bar in the evening, or in a salon in the middle of the afternoon."
"One of the many trendy bar/cafés located on the popular Place Saint Géry-Sint Goriksplein. You are assured good drinking in at least one of these establishments, which are very popular with younger Eurocrats, foreigners and interns, giving them a rather friendly cosmopolitan character."
"''445 Chaussée de Boondael-Boondaalsesteenweg'', While all the above locations are situated downtown in central Brussels, this location is the most popular bar on a strip of bars right by the Cimétière d'Ixelles-Begraafplaats van Elsene. It's location right off the student campus make it extremely popular with students who just want to kick back and have a few relaxed drinks. Note on certain nights there is also live music (making the establishment a lot more hectic). Worth a look especially towards the beginning and end of the academic year and in the summer (especially for their Jazzbreaks nights)."
"Organises ""Hydra Sessions"" and also ""Next Level"" and ""Caliente"" drum and bass parties at various locations. Hydra Sessions are major D&B nights with international headliners such as Pendulum, Spor, or Raiden, along national djs."
"A monthly night out for many locals since more than 10 years, blending all kind of music in unexpected venues. Come as you are."
"A nightclub where it all started and is a Brussels institution. Be sure to check it out. Popular among the young people for its Electronic scene, often having Dubstep and Drum & Bass nights, such as ''Rockme On Electro'', ''Cartel'', ''F*ckin Beat'' or other parties. (Watch out for these other parties in nights spread out in other smaller clubs in Brussels)."

"For electronica, noise-rock, electroclash, minimal techno as well as art exhibitions, social projects and installations."
"For young clubbers who just want to party, 2 minutes walking due South-East from the ''Grande Place''."
"The two biggest monthly gay clubs remain at La Demence at the Fuse. 100% House & Trance. Don't miss the crowded (but super small) Le Belgica bar, which plays house music. There are quite a lot of gay bars easily recognisable by their flag around the Grand Place area, especially on the street Marché Au Charbon/ Kolenmarkt."
"Very clean and very modern and chic. Free wi-fi (ask at reception for a code)."
"Has a reputation for being unclean and chaotic which may not be deserved. Reception closes early and there's a curfew between 1 and 6AM."
"Offers beds for budget traveling. A bit farther from city centre, not as safe area."

"All scheduled flights, including those operated by low cost airlines, land here. Henri Coanda airport is often referred to as Otopeni on airline bookings, because of its location . The airport, built in 1968, has undergone a massive modernization effort since the late 90s and is set to be further enlarged. It is the main hub for the Romanian flag carrier [http://www.tarom.ro/en/ Tarom]. All concessions inside the airport (shops, cafes, restaurants) are extremely expensive (especially departure side, about four times more expensive than in the city). Avoid exchanging money in the airport, exchange rates are 20-25% worse than what you would find in the city - you are advised to use a credit card at an ATM in the lobby for immediate needs and exchange money downtown. However, there is a Billa supermarket on the basement of arrival side whose price is same as others in the city. It's a bit of walk from the international departures but a great place to get a snack and/or spend your last few lei on departure."
"This smaller airport was used for commercial flights as early as the 1920s and became a low cost hub in its final years. From March 25, 2012 it is no longer used by passenger airlines. It is now a business airport."
"goes from the airport to downtown Bucharest at Piaţa Unirii. [http://ratb.ro/docpdf2/783%20AEROPORT%20HENRI%20COANDA%20SOSIRI.pdf Timetable] from Henri Coandă Airport to the city center. - Expect the trip with bus 783 to be about 50 minutes long (from Piaţa Unirii to the airport) or even longer during rush hour traffic. Note that buses do not have luggage racks."
"links the airport with the main train station, Bucuresti Nord (''Gara de Nord'') and terminate at Basarab (also metro, train and tram station). [http://ratb.ro/docpdf2/780%20AEROPORT%20HENRI%20COANDA%20SOSIRI.pdf Timetable] from the airport to Gara de Nord. When taking the 780 bus from Gara de Nord train station to Otopeni airport, note that Gara de Nord is not the end of the bus route, hence, the 780 buses that pass Gara de Nord actually run in two directions. Therefore, at Gara de Nord, to catch the 780 that takes you to Otopeni airport, you need to catch it from the 780 bus-stop that requires crossing a road from south side of the station, i.e. not the 780 bus stop that is directly outside the station. It is best to ask locals where the correct bus stop is."
"This is a combined transfer service by minibus then train to Bucuresti Nord station. '''Tickets''' can be bought inside the airport at CFR ticket counter. The trip starts with a transfer by shuttle bus to a small train stop two km away from the airport, followed by a 30 minutes train to Gara de Nord. The shuttle bus transfer IS INCLUDED in the train ticket. The total '''duration''' of the trip from airport to the Gara de Nord is approximately 50 minutes. From Gara de Nord you can take public transport (metro and buses) or you can depart by train towards other cities in Romania. This service is '''not recommended''' for transfers to the city center because it takes a long time to get to Gara de Nord, and then to the centre via metro, but can be an option if you plan to continue your journey by train."
"Due to the bad reputation of rip-off taxi drivers, the airport has now implemented an automated touch screen call-up system. After selecting the price you want to pay, you are given the number of your taxi which should arrive shortly. Make sure to get a taxi with the normal rate ('''1.39 lei/km''') and check the taxi number before getting in. This option is indeed more expensive, however it is more comfortable and you are taken straight to your hotel.   There are still taxis waiting at the Arrivals exit with rip off rates (called 'Fast Taxi'); it's best to avoid them. They charge the maximum allowed rate (3.5 lei/km). A trip to downtown with them costs at least 60-70 lei and may go up to €30 at night. Remember that for €30 you can get anywhere in the country by bus or train, so think twice before you decide to pay a taxi driver the same for a drive of less than 20km."
"Buses and minibuses from Chişinău (seven-eight buses every day, about 10 hours travel time, tickets around €15) arrive mostly to here."
"Transfer buses for routes from Western Europe usually arrive to here"
"Buses from Athens (several times per week, 16–20 hours travel time, tickets around €60) arrive at stations along Viilor road; also from Istanbul (three-four buses per day, 12–14 hours travel time, tickets around €45) arrive to here"
"daily bus from Sofia (7 hours travel time, €18)"
"All international trains and almost long distance internal trains arrive at here. - '''Do not use''' any exchange services around the train station: they offer about 30-50 percent below the actual exchange rate—use an ATM instead or walk a few blocks to get a much better rate, then take the subway system, which is reasonably priced (~1 euro for 2 uses, as of August 2015) and has clearly marked maps and schedules. Problems with taxi drivers cheating and overpricing the clients led to a public auction in August 2013, in order to monopolize and secure the taxi services around the station. Therefore, since November 2013, the only taxi company allowed near Gara de Nord is Meridian Taxi. Still, as in any other place, you should always look to see if the cab driver starts the meter and alert him by saying ""aparatul"" (''ah-pah-RA-tool'') while pointing at the meter. There may be a small number of private taxi drivers offering rides - be extremely wary. Their tariff is usually 3.5 lei/km, while the general tariff is 1.39 lei/km (as of August 2015). It is recommended to ride only with drivers who use the meter and have the general tariff. Never accept bargains and other offers, they are usually more than double than the route is worth. +phone=+40 21 3190358. Train to Budapest (16 hours, overnight, seat €57, bed €74), to Constanta (some trains 2 hours, 62 lei 2nd class, 92 lei 1st class)."

"the tourist can see the world's second largest building (after the US Pentagon), formerly named ""Casa Poporului"" (People's House). The building, which was built in 1984 by Nicolae Ceauşescu, spans 12 stories, 3100 rooms and covers over 330,000 sq m. 1/9 of Bucharest was reconstructed to accommodate this magnificent massive building and its surroundings. There are 30-45 minute tours every half hour which lead through the building's vast collection of marble rooms and culminates in an impressive view from Nicolae Ceauşescu's balcony. The marble and all the original decorations are 100% from Romania. The basic tour includes the halls and the balcony, worthwhile is the terrace addition for the wonderful view from the top of the building. The basement addition on the other hand is not worth the money. They only show two rooms containing airducts, no additional facts and it lasts only 5 minutes."
"A part of the city's historical heart was not demolished by Nicolae Ceauşescu. The area (stretching approximately between the Dâmboviţa river to the south, Calea Victoriei to the west, Calea Moşilor to the east and the Regina Elisabeta boulevard to the north) contains an assortment of middle 19th century buildings, ruins of the Wallachian princes' medieval court, churches, bank headquarters, a few hotels, clubs, restaurants and shops.

"Mid-range sister of famous Gundel. Claims to be the only Hungarian restaurant where women cook and serve food. Soups can be served either in a small tureen, which is better for a company to give everyone a try of several soups. ''Grilled сheese with caramelized walnut and fruits'' is a must-try, ideally with a semi-sweet ''Tokaji'' wine. ''Wiener schnitzel'' is huge-sized, be careful. ''Wine soup'' sound promising, but not everyone likes it. ''Creamy wild game soup with croutons'' is really good. Teas (''Impria'' brand) are quite average; ''cocoa'' is really good. To buy a take-away bottle of wine you liked in Bagolyvar, head to 1894 Food & Wine Cellar to save half a price. ''Tourist mix:'' many locals, but tourists still prevail; Russians/Ukrainians and Austrians can be frequently seen there."

"The flagship of Hungarian gastronomy for decades. Jackets are mandatory for gentlemen in evening time, and dinner clothes are recommended. On Sundays, the restaurant serves a buffet brunch, - reservations recommended. This is worth the price for the amazing dessert buffet alone. The restaurant is part of a holding including an own wine brand, and a line of delicacy products (cheese, goose liver, palinka and paprika)."

A brand new Egyptian Museum to replace this one is currently under construction close to the pyramids at Giza."
"For readers of Alaa al Aswani's best selling book The Yacoubian Building. You can see the Yacoubian Building on Talaat Harb St where it still stands and where the story was based, although in the book it is referred to by its old name of Soliman Pasha St."
"Now almost derelict and often misleadingly called the Champollion Palace, this once beautiful building is worth a look for its beautiful architecture, baroque and classical archways. Built in 1896 by designer Antonio Lasciac from imported Italian marbles and stone. This once beautiful palace and gardens are a reminder of the 'Glory days of Cairo'. The building was nationalized by President Nasser, and eventual transformed into Al Nassareya Boys School, which quickly destroyed the beautiful building. Today it is a temporary art gallery."

During the day you can sit and enjoy one of the many blends and play a game of backgammon with the more intellectual Egyptians who frequent the cafes during the day. However a more raucous clientele tends to congregate later in the evening. A nice place to people watch, and buy some unusual blends of coffee.<p>Ta'kiba Coffee shop is a short walk away by the wrongly named Champollion Palace,on Champollion Street,and round the corner from the Townhouse Gallery and Theater. The gallery has a clean toilet for public use."
"Mostly Arabic bookstore with a range of political literature and other books."
"A large iconic Egyptian, 150 year old department store. Sadly, filled with Chinese and poorly made Egyptian clothing even now since its privatization and takeover by the Gulf Kuwaiti Sultan Centre Company."
"This once family-owned department store was nationalized in 1961 and now has the neglected feeling of an East German department store. It has 3 floors and has a grand sweeping staircase, and a glass roofed atrium worth seeing for that alone, if you like old architectural building designs. Sells very cheap fabrics on the 2nd floor where you can buy shirt, blouse, and curtain material and have made up by one of Cairo's many tailors."

Usually hassle free and sellers are content to let you browse in peace. Always barter, and the price will come down the more you buy. Very old books and classics up to newly released novels and magazines. A great place to find treasures and find a few books for your trip. Visit Mahmoud at kiosks 83 and 84 for a great selection of used English books and a fair price. Many books are under 10LE each."
"Great bookstore just minutes away from Cairo Museum in the AUC Hill House campus. Excellent selection of new books and all the usual Egyptian authors' works can be found there amongst the latest releases."
"Large old mall mainly selling computers, second-hand PCs and laptops, and computer accessories with some clothing and footwear stores and a few airline offices. Toilets on each of the 4 floors."

"Fast Food Restaurant, done Egyptian style. Usually very busy packed with locals, but very good food at a very non-tourist price. Good fuul and falafel for about 1.5 LE a sandwich. Large restaurant located on 26th July St, just off Talaat Harb St, in downtown Cairo. A large schawerma 'Doner kebab sandwich' costs 8 LE."
"Kebab with a chicken twist, this Cairo chain serves up chicken in all it's oriental varieties."
"Egyptian cuisine is served in this small restaurant, including kofta, kabobs, stuffed pigeon, lamb, and chicken."
"5 LE entrance fee, open from 19:00. Mostly frequented by liberal and leftist Egyptians rather than Greeks, this is one of the best restaurants in Downtown Cairo. The Greek food offered is limited and the menu often erratic, but the dishes they do have in supply are very good and cheap. Alcohol (including imported spirits) is served and it's possible to just have a drink. Some of the best Kofte in Cairo. Closes down completely during Ramadan."
"A Cairo institution, this restaurant represents the original flagship of the now burgeoning Felfela chain of restaurants throughout Cairo. Long wooden tables and eclectic, somewhat kitschy décor: aquariums, clocks, half-lit grottos complete with mini-waterfalls. Somehow it all works. Specializes in classic Egyptian cuisine. The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat. Try the lemonade - perfect refreshment on a hot day! Also serves beer. Credit cars not accepted."
"Situated on the square itself is the once opulent Groppi's, formerly the most famous café, tearoom and patisserie in Egypt. Between the 1920s and early 1950s, Groppi's was the place to be seen by Cairene society. Its former glories stripped away to dusty memories, Groppi's is nonetheless still just open for business. Be sure to check out the ornate mosaics around the doorway - a relic of former times."
"Serving fondues, and other traditional Swiss dishes, pizza, salads and patisseries, this is one of the better continental restaurants in Downtown Cairo."
"Brassiere cum night club serving cocktails and Middle Eastern cuisine. Excellent service with life band and DJ."
"Another place of forlorn glory. Very popular with tourists, but the reasons for fame are questionable, it's rather expensive for what you get and service is slow, even for Cairo."
"Branch of the Cairo Peking restaurant chain. All their branches offer relatively predictable, but very good Chinese food."

"Exotic Indian dining experience."
"International cuisine with cocktails and evening entertainment served in the 36th floor restaurant with stunning panoramic views over the Nile and to the pyramids beyond"

"This is another street with lots of coffee shops and lots of atmosphere."
"This place doubles as coffee shop and bar, making it quite unique in Cairo. Some of the cheapest beer you can get in Cairo and given that this is also one of the least sleazy of the cheap downtown bars, there's no reason not to rave about the place. Reopened in May 2010 and as busy as always. 11 EP for a bottle of Stella; amazingly good service, but the waiters are equally insistent on a spot of baksheesh."
"This roof-top open-air hotel bar is also a restaurant, but most visitors prefer just to drink or have shisha. Beer (Stella or Saqqara) is 15 EP. Very popular among backpackers and foreign students. Open during Ramadan. Nice place to sit and have a drink, but poor service."
"Atmospheric British style pub with warm cosy atmosphere. Local and imported alcohol , moderate prices."
"Located right next to the Egyptian Museum and Nile it's a great place to start exploring the city. The rooms are comfortable and the staff are friendly though somewhat unprofessional. The common room offers fantastic floor to ceiling windows for wonderful views of the city. Rooms start from 115 EGP. Note that after the 2011 revolution, rooms can be bargained down to less than half that by a skilled bargainer."
"A very fun hotel located next to Khan el Khalily and near the Citadel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a great view from the roof, with an Arabian style tent set up.

"Sail over the Nile in an original Egyptian ship. Felluccas are waiting in front of the Four Seasons Hotel. No reservation needed. In the summer it is recommended to sail a Fellucca late in the evening or at night because of the heat during the day. The view at night is also very spectacular. As with most things in Egypt negotiating about the price is needed. 50 LE for an hour is a reasonable price."
"An evening stroll along the Corniche is always a good idea. Take a stroll up to the Qasr el-Nil Bridge, where you can see the lion statues at the foot of the bridge. Qasr el-Nil Bridge is a popular spot for young Egyptian couples to have an inexpensive date. Many couples stay out for hours on the bridge, where you can often find vendors renting plastic chairs by the hour, and selling roasted lib (peanuts, pumpkin seeds) in small paper cones, and hot sweet tea served in glasses. Occasionally you will see amateur fishermen landing Nile perch from the bridge. A great place to see the lights over Cairo city at night."
"Enjoy a romantic evening cruising the Sofitel owned M/S Scarabee on the Nile. Scarabee offers belly dancing, live music, and international cuisine, grilled meats, and vegetable platters served buffet style."
"Enjoy a drink and cruise up the Nile in the evening on deck in the Moonlight Cafe, or enjoy lunch or dinner downstairs in the Baccarat Restaurant aboard the Grande Hyatt's private yacht the Marquis. Lunch is served 14.30 till 16.30. Dinner served 20.00 till 22.00. Reserve seats at Hyatt reception."
"Garden City is a great place to wander around admiring architecture. Its streets are filled with what once were beautiful palaces and villas, homes to the elite of Cairo.  A few buildings worth mentioning are the British Embassy (Bayt al Lourd) on Ahmed Ragab Street. A beautifully designed building with extensive grounds which can be viewed from the main street. Built in 1894 it became the focal point of many interesting historical meetings. Two of them worth mentioning are the garden of the embassy was the meeting place where Lord Mountbatten Viceroy of India and uncle to Prince Philip of Greece, later to become the Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth the first of Great Britain, where Lord Mountbatten first spoke of the betrothal of the then Princess Elizabeth in marriage. It was also from the British Embassy that in 1942 the British Envoy Sir Miles Lampson drove in a military cortege to the Palace of Abdeen to give the then King Farouk a choice of appointing a pro-British cabinet or abdicate.  The Grey Towers Building at 10 Itihad el Mohamyeen el Arab St, Garden City, also known as 10 Downing Street as it was the British Army's GHQ during World War 2, where in August 1971 British Secretary of State Oliver Lyttelton and General Charles De Gaulle of France negotiated and signed documents recognising the independence of both Syria and Lebanon, from French and British protectorates. Much history lies in these villas and palaces which fill Garden City, and architects can marvel at the various styles evident in the various facades."

"A semicircular hotel situated on the North tip of Rhoda Island, linked to the city center by a private bridge, and approximately 14 miles from Cairo International Airport. Has a revolving restaurant, a pool and great views of the city.  An attached shopping mall with food court and a range of restaurants in the hotel with a terrace overlooking the fountain in the Nile make for an incomparable view if you eat outside.

"Views of the Nile from elegant rooms and enjoyable bars/restaurants."
"A distinctive landmark visible from most of downtown Cairo, the Cairo Tower was completed in 1961 and reaches a height of 187 m. Great day and night views over central Cairo and to the Pyramids from the revolving café and restaurant at the top. Be wary of security guards who will give 'tours' of the area and demand large tips, and note that the café requires a minimum expenditure of 30 LE. Although it's not written in Arabic or English at the ticket booths, Egyptians visit for 20 L.E. Unlike most sights in Egypt, there is no secondary student pricing."

"The museum is located in the former palace of Prince Amru Ibrahim in Zamalek."
"Contemporary Egyptian art gallery"
"Contemporary Egyptian art gallery"

"Egypt's most important cultural stage, home to much more than just the opera. Founded in 1869 as the Royal Opera House by Khedive Ismail,, who commissioned Verdi's ''Aida'', the original building was destroyed in a fire in 1971, so an entirely new one was built and opened in 1988. Today, it has two halls that can house 1300 and 500 people, as well as an outdoor theatre, and there are cultural performances virtually every night."
"An outdoor concert scene with modern Egyptian groups playing both Western and oriental music. The music might differ in quality, but it's a good place to meet young Egyptians. No alcohol."
"Includes four restaurants, swimming, lighted tennis, tennis pros and lessons, table tennis, squash, croquet, playing fields, walking tracks, exercise facilities, equestrian, basketball, children's play areas, saunas, bridge and board games."

"Small bookstore, with a large selection of English children's books and stationary products."
"Has high quality men's dress shirts that rivals anything in London, Paris, or Milan, and does free custom tailoring for trousers and suits. Ties are over priced, but otherwise, the prices are extremely reasonable given the quality."

"Cairo's only organic food/health product store."
"Excellent Italian food. Owned, and run, by the son of the famous actor Omar Sharif."
"This place serves pasta, and dishes are amazingly cheap, ranging from six to about twenty EP. Small, intimate setting, making it an excellent spot for dates (despite its small setting, the waiters will let you linger/flirt at the table). Generally full from 5PM-close, waiting on the street outside is common, but it is worth the wait. They serve up some of the best pasta in all of Cairo. You pick your sauce, you pick the kind of pasta you want, and the cooks do the rest. The kitchen is directly in view so you can watch them serve up your food. Try the bolognese, the crab sauce, or the frutti de mare with white sauce."
"Excellent and well priced Italian, much like a takeaway with 2 or 3 tables."
"It has a West European style and serves food all day during Ramadan."
"Purportedly the best burgers in Cairo. Doubles as a pub. Open during Ramadan."

"Serves traditional Thai food in stylish settings and good service, this is a welcome add to the Cairo Thai scene. Specify if you want the food spicy."
"A liquor store with a wide variety of spirits. One of the few places to find alcohol in this largely Islamic city."
"Another branch in the Om Kolsoum Hotel on Abu el-Feda just north of the 26th July St Bridge crossing to Agouza. Part of a local coffee shop chain (think Starbucks) with pastries, light sandwiches, sodas, and free wi-fi."
"A small, long-established and highly popular café frequented by expats and students. Rather intimate, space is at a premium with just a few stools available or stand at the bar. Very good cappuccino. A great selection of sweets, pastries and juices is also on offer."
"Good coffee, a variety of Western and Arabic dishes including ""American breakfast"" and pancakes. Popular hangout for foreign students. Wireless internet available."

"An absolutely gorgeous open-air Lounge Bar/Restaurant at the northern tip of Zamalek, directly on the Nile. One of the most popular places for the young elite and resident foreigners. Sequoia does not only offer a variety of good mezzes, grills and other main courses but is also one of the best (if not ''the'' best) places in town to smoke shisha. Sequoia has a shisha menu with 15-20 flavours of tobacco, which you can smell before making your choice. The interior is modern and all white, the atmosphere is relaxed and informal. Reservation may be needed on Wednesday nights and weekends when people come here to see and be seen. Expensive, but worth a visit."
"Noon-2AM. Typical British pub frequented by expats and locals alike. International brands of liquor. Food served. Very popular, book table if you are not content sitting in the bar. Open during Ramdan. Stella LE 15, main dishes from LE 25-60."
"Another popular pub haunt. Cable TV, DJ and house music. Pub menu. Open during Ramadan. Stella LE 15, main dishes from LE 25-60."
"Karaoke-pub turns disco when the crowds are big enough. Local beer LE 20."
"Run-down and a bit basic, but not without charm, run by an Egyptian family, in a quiet and very safe embassy neighbourhood. A basic breakfast is provided. Discounts on longer stays, unmarried couples might face problems at this location and teenagers tend to get harassed by the manager's wife."
"An upper budget location - the people are nice, rooms clean, prices reasonable, and atmosphere peaceful. Free wi-fi, according to the website of the hotel."
"This hotel is more notable for its location than its service - rooms can be small, but comfortable. The service is good, and most room rates include breakfast - ask for a Nile view when booking. Free-of-charge wireless internet service is available."
"In the same building as the Hotel Longchamps with a equally friendly staff. Clean, serviceable rooms and a buffet breakfast."
"A spotless 3-star hotel situated on the top two floors of an apartment building on a beautiful tree-lined street. Garden terrace upstairs. Room rates include a buffet breakfast. Laundry service available. Optional airport pickup and delivery LE 95 flat fee."
"Housed in a former royal palace originally built to host Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie for the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The old palace is still there, but the guest rooms (all 1069 of them) are housed in a modern tower block next to it. Still, the six-acre Omar Khayyam gardens are beautiful and it's a great place to have a drink or puff on a shisha. If you can afford the price tag, a stay at the Marriott is a wonderful way to begin to acclimate to Cairo."
"Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, Karim at FB Stables is also great for a ""tourist"" type ride to view the Pyramids and Sphinx from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Sir can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and moonlit rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with bbq) with unrivalled views over the Pyramids - a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light shows. Great horses - no beating or slapping at FB stables. Besides an amazing trip, the shisha and Karim's amazing support, it was a place to safely say yes without getting ripped off afterwards! FB's Abu Sir second stables are very relaxing too!"
"Admission: foreign languages shows LE 130, 90, 75 with discounted 45 ticket only available in the 75 section. The LE 130 and LE 90 tickets are for the 1st and 2nd-3rd rows respectively and may not be worth the added expense. Arabic show LE 11, private shows in foreign languages, LE 65 + LE 300 (covers operating expenses), Arabic private show, LE 16.50 + LE 150. More than slightly kitsch and frequently inaccurate in historical detail, but a worthwhile evening activity nonetheless. The ""voice of the Sphinx"" narrates the history of the Giza Plateau and its place in Egyptian history, as a dazzling laser display picks out the details of the Pyramids and displays historical scenes on the side of the Great Pyramid itself. If you eat at the Pizza Hut restaurant just outside the entrance to the Sound and Light Show, there's a good chance you'll be offered to watch the show from the roof of the restaurant for a small tip. While it's not as good as watching it from a front row seat inside the fences, it's excellent value for money. As of November 2009, extremely bright lights have been pointed at the roof of the Pizza Hut and various other buildings to get tourists to attend the show. They put projection lights towards the Pizza Hut so it's not easy to see much. Pizza Hut has replied by putting up a barricade on the roof to try to block the light."

"A relaxed indoor bazaar."
"Chic Designer Shopping including brands such Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Christian Dior and many others."
"This eatery is located on the Nile, in a docked ship, sharing space with a TGI Friday's below.  Popular with locals and tourist visitors, but the food is mediocre, overpriced, and service is haphazard."
"The restaurant has been open for over a century and is far and away the most stylish place for lunch or just a cold beer. Expect to pay Western prices for the privilege."
"An extremely good upmarket Indian restaurant.  Reservations necessary."
"The boat features Pharonic decor, and offers a buffet with international and Egyptian cuisine, and belly dancing."

Tastefully restored and located very close to the Pyramids. Rooms in the newer Garden wing from $150, Palace wing rooms from $210; be sure to ask for a room with a view of the Pyramids. The main Pyramids gate is only a 5 minute walk away."
"Erected by Baron Empain, this utterly bizarre structure was inspired by Angkor Wat and the Hindu temples of Orissa (now known as Odisha), and looks thoroughly out of place in Cairo. You can take a peek from the road, but alas, the interior has been off limits for years."
"A miniature version of Istanbul's Ayasofya, dubbed the ""jelly mold"" by expats. Especially worth a look."
"The obelisk originates from the Temple of Atum, the same complex where Cleopatra's Needle in London and the one in New York's Central Park came from. The obelisk dates back to approximately 1900 BC, providing a reminder of Heliopolis' past, as it sits in Midan al-Misallah in the midst of the modern city."
"Once a grand hotel that opened in 1910, the Uruba Palace is now the official residence of the Egyptian President. The hotel fell into disuse in the 1960s, and for a brief period, the palace was home to the Federation of Arab Republics. In the 1980s, the palace was restored and became the official residence."
"Annual cultural festival that takes place each spring, centering on Heliopolis’ Baghdad Street. The festival features Egyptian performing artists."
"A little bit away from this area of town, and ""off the beaten path"" for many tourists is an area of town well worth seeing. It is called Garbage City, or in Arabic Manshiet Nasr. It is the home to approximately 2 million Coptic Christians and a beautiful monastery carved into a mountain side, the largest monastery in the Middle East by seating capacity. The walk through Garbage City is alone worth the trip, as you get to see real life Cairo for many of its residents."
"A modern shopping mall, with seven levels of shops and restaurants, such as the Virgin Megastore.  A large multiplex cinema and indoor amusement center are also located at City Stars, along with a number of hotels including the Intercontinental and a Holiday Inn."
"It's one of the best foul and tamiyya joints in town."
"A pioneer in the Egyptian based chains offers some of the best Shawerma rolls and Shish-Kebab sandwiches, excellent value meals and great taste- delivery is an option by calling 16013. relatively cheap.

"Beer shop offering chilled beers delivered right to your door."
"Stunning new hotel built around a giant glass atrium."
"Somewhat dated but comfortable hotel within striking distance to the airport, with a free shuttle service.  Little of interest in the vicinity, but near the Cairo Conference Center."
"Closest hotel to the airport.  The lobby and public areas have been given a facelift and are now bright, modern, and airy, but the rooms still look and feel like a cheap motel with lumpy beds, and noisy air conditioning.  Adequate for a one-night transit, but you wouldn't want to spend your whole vacation here.  Free half-hourly shuttle bus from/to airport."
"A 257-room 5-star hotel with a pool, casino, and full service spa."
"A 790 room property."
"Overlooks Baron Empain Palace. 126 rooms & suites, several  restaurants & bars and conference facilities."
"One of the largest Fatimid mosques in Cairo. It was originally decreed in 990 by the famously eccentric caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (""Ruler by God's Command"") who, among other things, prohibited eating grapes or playing chess. Increasingly paranoid towards the end of his reign, he disappeared without a trace at age 36. The mosque has been used as a prison, a warehouse and an elementary school before being restored (or, rather, rebuilt) as a mosque in 1980."
"Possibly the best-preserved Ottoman merchant house (16-17th C) in Cairo. Little visited and a place of quiet beauty."
"Built by Mamluk Sultan Al-Nasir c. 1304 in honor of his father Qalawun. The complex contains a mosque, a madrasah (Islamic school) and the mausoleum where Sultan Qalawun is buried. The mausoleum in particular is often described as the world's second most beautiful, second only to the Taj Mahal, which it slightly resembles."
"One of the most sacred Islamic sites in the country and the Middle East, the mosque hosts the shrine in which the head of Ibn al-Hussein, the grandson of Muhammed the Prophet, is alleged to have been buried. The present building dates to 1870 and replaces a much earlier 12th century mosque. The ''Midan'' (square) before the mosque forms one of the most convenient access points to the Khan el-Khalili."
"Founded in 970, al-Azhar is one of Cairo's oldest mosques and the world's oldest operating university."
"The Al-Azhar Park is overlooking Darb al-Ahmar and the Citadel. Built on a garbage dump, it's today a green lung of Cairo and a pleasant area to stroll around and enjoy magnificent views of the city. It hosts a restaurant in a modern castle-style building and several good cafes. The theater has musical events almost every evening."
"Finished in 1363, this mosque was raised by the Mamluk Sultan Hassan and lying below the citadel and next to the much more recent rifaii mosque, it's maybe the primary example of the Islamic mamluk dynasty. One of the largest mosques in Egypt and the Arab world, it was used as a school for different Islamic (sunni) schools of thought and also contains a mausoleum."
"Built in 1911, this mosque holds the tombs of a great number of Egyptian aristocrat families and also the last Shah of Iran, who retreated to Cairo after being ousted from power in his country."
"Raised in 877 by the Abbasid governor, this mosque has a style reminiscent of the Samarra mosque in Iraq, quite different from other Egyptian mosques. Built on a six-acre site, the mosque was large enough to accommodate all of the city's males for Friday prayer. The mosque has an open interior, and the minaret, the oldest in Egypt, is accessible for a little baksheesh."
"The mansion of the British Egyptologist Gayer Anderson has a large and fascinating number of rooms displaying artifacts from the traditional life of the Egyptian elites."
"Built inside the Citadel by the famous Egyptian regent Mohammed Ali between 1830 and 1848, and site of his tomb."
"This is one of several Coptic Christian churches, built inside caves, that were enlarged by the Zabbaleen east of Islamic Cairo, where the Zabbaleen (garbage people) live and work."
"Cairo's giant ''souq'' (market). The khan, built in 1382, was originally a hub for traveling traders in the Fatimid era. Today, it's the most visited tourist market in Egypt. Almost any kind of souvenir can be bought here, but also quality produce is still to be found. Venture out of the tourist market and you'll find bustling local trade. Among other things you'll find Islamic clothes, scarves, belly-dancing equipment, furniture, water-pipes and of course gold, silver and jewels. Haggling is the rule of the day, and merchants used to tourists often state very high prices at first."
"If your dream is to bring a Bedouin tent back from the country, this is the place to go. Dating to the 17th century, this is Cairo's last remaining covered market, and these days the wares on offer range far beyond tents."
"This budget restaurant, its name meaning ""the mule,"" is purported to serve the best ''foul'' in Cairo. Its location--opposite to one of Cairo's most revered mosques, Seidna Zeinab, and its proximity to Ibn Tulun--makes it an necessary part of any visit to this part of the city."
"This place serves sweet Egyptian pancakes (''fateer'') and western-style pizzas for between 20-35 EP."
"This upscale restaurant caters to tourists, but offers decent food in an air-conditioned setting."
"For many years this was the preferred place of Nobel winner Naguib Mafhouz to meet with his friends. It's a great place to stop for tea and shisha and watch the world bustling by. Few places are better for having an easy conversation with people from all continents, as well as with relaxing Egyptians that speak English well."
"Stay away from the food at this top-floor restaurant, but sipping a cup of tea above great views of the Midan Hussein by night is an enjoyable way to pass the time."
"A basic hotel in an interesting area. Prices from LE 45 for single rooms with shared baths on each floor to LE 75 for doubles with en suite bathroom. AC is extra, but the ceiling fans works well. Ask for a room with a balcony."
"A good hotel. Typical price about 100 EGP for a single room and shared bathroom with AC, no heater. There is a good roof balcony and free wifi access."
"Home of the late King Hussein of Jordan and his first wife Dina Abdel Aziz Ouan whilst they courted and married in Ma'adi Cairo April 15th 1955. The villa was actually abandoned for a long while, but recently repainted and refurbished and turned into office space for a petroleum company."
"Features two dining rooms, serving mainly Egyptian cuisine, along with belly dancing, music and Tanoora dancers."
"A 60 square kilometer, near Ma'adi, that offers opportunity for taking a trek, jogging, rock climbing, and cycling.  Wadi Digla is also a good spot for bird watching, and viewing the various reptile species, plants, and deer that reside there.  To get out of the park, either pay to have the taxi wait, or it's a 15 minute walk out to the main road where you can catch another taxi.  If you do walk out to the main road, do be aware that a pack of dogs hangs out around the park entrance."
"Place to get coffee and enjoy home-made waffles."
"A pleasant fresh fish restaurant with a wide range of choice and good service.  Choose your fish on ice before it is cooked.  Fruit and alcoholic drinks available.  Prices around EGP 120 per person including wine but strongly dependent on what fish you choose."
"Situated along the Nile, Fusion serves Asian cuisine."
"Serves Chinese and Japanese cuisine."
"Numerous varieties of bagels, along with muffins, scones, Belgian waffles, and other options.  Wi-fi available."
"Serves pizza, pasta, and other Italian cuisine."
"Chinese food ranging from dumplings, fried rice, and various rice, noodle, meat, and vegetable dishes, along with deep-fried bananas topped with ice cream for dessert.  Eat in or delivery."
"American diner named after owner Lucille Crooks.  Improbably enough, according to ''Time'' magazine, they serve what may be the best burger in the entire world; perhaps a small exaggeration, but you'll certainly be hard put to find a better one in Egypt.  Just don't expect any pork in your BBQ ""bacon"" burger.  Also, a good place for American-style breakfast."
"Outlet of the American restaurant chain located along the Nile in Ma'adi."
"A pleasant fresh fish restaurant with a wide range of choice and good service.  Choose your fish on ice before it is cooked.  Fruit and alcoholic drinks available.  Prices around EGP 120 per person including wine but strongly dependent on what fish you choose."
"Once a four-star hotel, now distinctly worse for the wear."
"Nile views for some, heated pool and a casino in a conventional tall box skyscraper building 12 km from downtown.  A 5 star hotel in a good state of repair with well furnished rooms and comfortable beds.  Generally rooms are well lit and decorated with pictures, with a minibar, room safe, and a broadband cable connection (EGP 3.90/min, up to 155/day).  Wireless internet is also available.  Rooms are narrow (10' or 3m), perhaps to maximise the number overlooking the Nile view which is splendid, including, through the haze, pyramids at Giza, Saqqara and Dhahsur and a foreground of reeds, fields and palms on the farther Western bank of the Nile.  Food is quite OK but uninspiring though the Nile view from the restaurant helps.  Reception is secured and pleasant but not in a grand hotel style.  Restaurants on the Nile are walking distance if you want them."
"3 stars hotel, 5 minutes awalk from the Kutseka metro station. Advantagely situated directly on the Cornishe Innile (the river Nile street), many rooms offer a magnificent view of the Nile valley and the Giza pyramids. 35 rooms, $50 for a single room for foreigners, $65 for double room for foreigners. Prices include breakfast, taxes and services."
"located at the eastern end of Ramses Station, this museum houses an amazing collection of steam locomotives, including that used by Empress Eugenie during her opening of the Suez Canal in 1863. The entrance fee increased in September 2008 from 1.5 LE, to 20 LE (10 for students)."
"Completed in the early 1990s, this beautiful mosque is worth taking a look at."
"The bar at the Windsor Hotel is where the flotsam and jetsam of the expat world hang out. A place where Somerset Maugham meets Mr. Mulliner, it is the perfect place to meet odd characters!"
"A popular hotel, but some would say overpriced for what you get."
"Housed in a large, modern, purpose-built tower, the Ramses Hilton has great views from its upper floors, but lacks any real character. Still, the standards are what you would expect from the Hilton chain - as are the prices!"
"Serves sweet fatirs, as well as varieties with cheese and meat toppings. Has a small sitting area, or is good for take away."
"Popular koshari chain, serves koshari in various sizes though the small (3 lb) is a good size portion. You can add hot sauce or a lemon sauce. For 5.50 LE, you can get a small koshari and a can of Coca-Cola. Eat-in or takeaway."
"Modern coffee chain, serves salad, sandwiches, etc."
"Modern coffee-chain that also serves sandwiches, salads, etc. Wi-Fi available, credit cards accepted."
"Modern coffee chain that also serves desserts and some sandwiches"
"Reportedly the best Thai food in Cairo. We see no reason to contest."
"Hotel Osiris is a small, seventeen room hotel located on the top floor of a building near Bab el-Louk Square, and is a five minute walk from Midan Tahrir. The hotel provides clean rooms, some with private bathrooms."
"Walid and his staff are great."
"Located on the western edge of Midan Tahrir, close to the Egyptian Museum, and built on the site of the former barracks of the British garrison of Empire days. This branch of the Hilton chain was the first major international hotel to be built in Cairo after the war. Very convenient for transport connections, for the Egyptian Museum and for Downtown."
"Opened in 1987, the Semiramis is one of Cairo's premier hotels."
"A 24-story hotel located along the Nile."
"The Mosque of Amr ibn al-As was originally built (in Fustat) in 642, as Cairo's first mosque, following the Arab conquest of Egypt. The mosque was rebuilt in 673 by Mu'awiya. The mosque was rebuilt again in 1179 under the rule of Saladin, after expelling the Crusaders."
"Egypt's oldest surviving synagogue, dating to the 9th century and housed in a former church constructed in the 4th century. The synagogue was established in 1115, in what was previously a Coptic church, when the Copts were forced to sell it to raise funds to pay taxes to Ibn Tulun. The famed Geniza Documents, discovered in the synagogue basement, are of great interest to modern scholars of the medieval period in Egypt."
"The Church of St. George dates to the 10th century or earlier. However, the current structure on the site was built in the early 20th century, having been rebuilt after a 1904 fire. It should be noted that this church is the Greek Orthodox Church of Agios Georgios (Saint George) and it is frequently mislabeled as a Coptic church. A sign in Greek outside the main entrance testifies to this. The church stands on the same grounds as the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria's offices and the Greek Orthodox cemetery. One explanation for the church's unusual circular ground floor plan (as seen in the photograph) may be that it was possibly built on ancient circular Roman ramparts. The remains of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchs can be found in one of the underground levels of the church. The cemetery contains another Greek Orthodox Church, that of the Dormition of the Virgin."
"St. Sergius is one of the oldest churches in Cairo, built in the 4th century it has been built, destroyed and renovated many times over."
"Established in 1908 and recently restored to a high standard, the Coptic Museum houses Coptic art and artifacts from Late Antiquity, from the late Roman empire through to the Islamic era and beyond. The presentation is clear in English, French and Arabic with generally well thought out lighting. The display of mainly stone architectural fragments on the ground floor shows the development of the early fusion between Christian and Egyptian symbolism. They also demonstrate that the early Christian era was much cruder in its use of stone than its Pharaonic ancestors. Several frescoes from the early monasteries are displayed. The tapestries and embroideries on the second floor illustrate more homely but highly developed arts. The building itself is a treat, with elaborate wooden screens called ''mashrabiyya'' on the windows and ornately carved wooden arabesque ceilings."
"In Arabic, ''Kineeset al-Muallaqa''. The Hanging Church, built in 690, is situated on two bastions of the Roman fortress and its nave is suspended over a passageway."
"Dating back to 861, the Nilometer is a large stone obelisk that was used to measure the level of the Nile was measured and therefore the tax rates for the farmers fixed. The Nilometer became obsolete when the Aswan Dam was built."
"It's said that this is the boat from Agatha Christie's famous novel ""Death on the Nile"". The boat features a dining room, where set menus are served, the Shanghai Pub, and a deck from which to watch the Nile."

The park contains numerous statues and sculptures, some of historical figures, others more whimsical and fun. The ''Pavilhões do Parque'' are several interconnected structures that have served various purposes in the past. These lovely buildings, which serve as a sort of emblem of the park, have unfortunately been allowed to degrade and are on the verge of ruin. Their beauty, however, is still evident, and their reflection on the lake makes for a popular photo opportunity. The park's amenities include a playground, picnic area, tennis courts, and restrooms.

Nowadays, Carnaval in Portugal takes on a more secular aspect, with little attention paid to religion. Festivities begin several days before, with a party for the aged and a children's parade. Celebrations culminate in a grand parade with costumed revelers and floats along Avenida Primeiro de Maio, the wide avenue that connects the railway station to the city hall. Young and old dress up, some preferring to make a political statement, others honoring the latest Marvel superhero or Disney princess, or dressing as fruits and vegetables."

Chicken On The Way delivers wonderful deep-fried chicken, french fries and corn fritters, at a fair price. This is an old-school joint; no frills, nothing fancy, and none of that new-fangled low-fat junk. The dining space here is two picnic tables next to busy 14th St. But it's still hands-down the best fried chicken in the city. A meal runs in the $8-10 range. Other locations have recently opened in Mackenzie Towne, Macleod Trail (in Brick Plaza), Forest Lawn, and Temple; the new locations have tables so that you can dine in."
"Classic drive-through burger joint. Locally-famous burgers, fries, onion rings, and milkshakes at very affordable prices.

Park in the adjacent lot and walk up to the front windows; you'll get faster service than in the drive-through and you can eat at one of their picnic tables. The finest milkshake in the city; thick and made with real fruit (over 20 flavours!). Some feel that the quality of the hot food has gone down recently, but most agree that the shakes still rock."

"In the whole world, there are only three churches built over the tomb of an Apostle of Jesus Christ- the Basilica of Saint Peter built over the tomb of St.Peter in Rome, Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela built over the tomb of St.James in Spain and Basilica of the National Shrine of St.Thomas built over the tomb of St.Thomas. Basilica of the National Shrine of St.Thomas is in Chennai, India. The present National Shrine of St.Thomas is built over the tomb of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who came to India in the year 52 AD. After preaching on the West coast, he came to Chennai (formerly Madras), and suffered martyrdom on a hill at the outskirts of the city, today known as ""St. Thomas Mount."" His body was buried on the spot over which the present Basilica stands. A valuable work of art kept in the Basilica is an ancient painting of Our Blessed Mother, in front of which the other great apostle of India, St. Francis Xavier, used to pray. There are two new structures today: The Tomb Chapel below the Basilica and 'Museum cum theatre'. The new underground chapel with a separate access outside the church structure, allows pilgrims to pray at the tomb and tourists to visit it, without disturbing the sacred functions in the church. The museum exhibits artifacts connected with St. Thomas and the Basilica, and the theatre is used for screening a short video on the life of the Apostle."

"This is one of '''''the oldest surviving churches built by the British''''' in India. This is the first English church in India and the oldest Anglican church in the East.Designed by William Dixon, the then Master Gunner of the Fort, it was constructed under the supervision of the Governor Streynsham Master. Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance- thick walls, castellated parapets and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. Robert Clive - more famous as Clive of India- married Margaret Maskelyne here in 1753. The first but equally famous wedding was that of Governor Elihu Yale (who was to become the benefactor of Yale College) to Catherine Himmers in November 1680. The interior of the church contains many fascinating plaques and monuments to early British India evoking past glories and lives full of achievement. It also contains the old colours of the Madras Fusiliers, the first European regiment of the East India Company. The glass windows, wall frescos, teak plaques still shine with their all time glory."

"St.Thomas, referred to as Didymus, in the Gospel of St.John is one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. He is one of the prime witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus. St. Thomas Mount is associated with St. Thomas, the apostle of Christ, who is believed to have been martyred here. The mount is commonly called in Tamil ""Parangi Malai"" or ""Bhringi Malai'.History says 2000 years ago, a saint 'Parangi' lived here ('parangi' in Tamil language is used to refer to a white person). According to local myth, St. Thomas was one of the first Christians to reach India and to preach Christianity. He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area. A small relic-filled Church built in 1523 by the Portuguese stands at the summit of the 300 feet high St. Thomas Mount. The place was visited by Pope John Paul II during his visit to India on 5 February 1986. At the northern foot of the mount, is a gateway of four impressive arches surmounted by a cross bearing the inscribed date 1547. A flight of 160 steps leads up to the summit of the mount. There are fourteen stations of the cross erected on the way to the summit."

"This is a historical landmark. Constructed by Wallajah family in memory of Nawab Muhammad Ali Walajah, in '''1795'''. It is an imposing structure of symmetry and form of architectural magnificence with an imposing facade. The Mosque stands in extensive grounds, which are being used as a forum for religious and cultural activities. The magnificent grey granite structure is built without steel and wood. This architectural marvel is one of the important mosques in Chennai. The Nawab’s descendants are still living in a mansion known as '''Amir Mahal'''. One distinctive feature of this mosque is that the chronogram engraved in stone and fixed on the inside of the western wall of the mosque is by a non-Muslim, Rajah Makkan Lal “Khirad”, a Persian and Arabic scholar of repute, who was the private secretary to the Nawab. It may be mentioned in this regard that, as far as is known, no other mosque in the world has a chronogram composed by a non-Muslim. The Mosque has two minarets at the front. Medieval architecture is clearly visible in the construction of this great mosque. ''The Eid Prayer timing remains the same, 10AM, since 1749 A.D.'' This historic mosque is under the management of H.H. Adjoining the Wallajah Mosque is the tomb of the great Islamic saint Maulana Abdul Ali Bahrul Uloom, a divine scholar of the days of the Nawab Wallajah. In this enclosure also are the tombs of the late Nawabs of the Carnatic, the Princess of Arcot and other eminent Muslim scholars and theologians. Wallajah Mosque can be reached either from Ellis Rd (backside) or the Triplicane High Rd."

"10th Jan to 22nd Jan 2014, YMCA Grounds, Anna Salai, Nandanam. Location and dates may vary annually. If you happen to be in Chennai in January, Chennai Book Fair is an event not to miss. Plan to visit on a weekday as they attract lesser crowds and you can browse through the collections peacefully. If you pick a weekend or holiday, try to visit in the morning instead of the evening. Look through all the shops but it is usually better to skip the marquee stalls and visit the smaller ones which have books stacked all around. You will be rewarded with some great finds as these shops have lesser known but excellent titles from all around the world. Carry cash as many of the smaller shops do not accept credit/debit cards and cash also helps to bargain down the price of the books to some extent. On average, paperback novels in bargain shops cost ₹100 to ₹200. A budget of ₹3000 (around $50) should be enough to purchase a good collection of books."

"Initially constructed by King Mangrai c.1296. Formerly known as Hua Wiang (""head of the city"") Gate as it was considered the most important. King Saen Muang Ma (1365-1401) built an albino elephant (cháang-pʉ̀ʉak ช้างเผือก) monument outside the gate during his reign. The name of the gate then changed gradually to reflect its presence. Traditionally, kings-to-be entered the city through this gate on the way to their coronations. Taking the road north from here takes one to the intra-provincial bus station, also named Chang Phuak, then onward to Mae Rim, Pai, Chiang Rai and the Lao border."
"Taking the left turn at this point takes one to the superhighway. Straight on leads to a bridge over the Ping River and beyond it, the rail and bus stations. Turning right (south) parallels the eastern boundary of the moat."
"Built c.1296. Originally called Chiang Ruak Gate after a nearby village. ""Tha Phae"" means ""raft landing"". Originally there was an outer Tha Phae on the river and this gate, the inner Tha Phae. When the raft landing was supplanted by a bridge, this became the Tha Phae Gate. Rebuilt 1985-1986. The vicinity is by far the area most useful to visitors as it contains the greatest number of tourist services. The Night Bazaar lies due east, about a 15 min walk. There always seems be something going on in the plaza adjacent to the gate. Every Sunday a Walking Street Market originates here."
"A ""katam"" was a ""fishtrap"". Water flowing into the city from the Hua Lin corner (NW) of the city collected near this corner in a large pond full of fish. The corner took on the name of the tool used to catch the fish. Turning left here leads to the River Ping."
"Built c.1296 at the founding of the city by King Mangrai. Traditionally the start of the road south to Lamphun. Reconstructed c.1800. Rebuilt 1966-1969. Nearby is the Chiang Mai (fresh) Market, selling foodstuffs. Adjacent are many food stalls, which are popular throughout the day and evening. Across the street to the south is a Walking Street Market every Saturday."
"First mentioned in historical records about 1545. Traditionally used to transport the dead out of the city to crematoria outside the city proper."
"Refers to a stupa ""kuu"" containing the ashes of a person named ""Huang"". Rebuilt c. 1800. Turning left here leads to the Airport Plaza Shopping Centre and the airport."
"On the sign, misspelled in English as ""saun dok"". Little in the vicinity of interest to visitors."
"""Hua"" means ""head"" and ""lin"" meant ""aqueduct"". At this corner the small brook, Hûuai Kaeo, was lifted over the city's rampart to provide fresh water to the settlement. Turning left here leads to the Nimmanhaemin District, Chiang Mai University, and onward to Doi Suthep."
"A well-known Asian low-cost airline, has domestic flights from/to Bangkok (Don Mueang airport), Phuket, Krabi, Hat Yai. Used to be the cheapest option if you booked at least a week before, but now it's true only during the best promotional offers (typically available months before the flight). Regular fare for tickets to Bangkok, including taxes, is from 1,400 baht (with fees for luggage, food, seat reservation easily adding almost half of that). Promotional fares can be much less. Prices can be significantly higher if you book just a few days before, or want a specific day/flight."
"A full-service carrier positioning itself as an ""Asia's boutique airline"", flies to from/to Ko Samui, Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi), Krabi, Phuket and Udon Thani. Surprisingly, Bangkok Airways can be cheaper than the budget airlines, particularly if you book just a few days ahead."
"Kan Air flies to and from Chiang Mai to Khon Kaen, Pai, Nan, Mae Hong Son, Hua Hin and Phitsanulok."
"Thai (semi-) low-cost carrier, flies from/to Bangkok's Don Mueang Airport more than ten times a day (typically from 1,500 baht. Promo fares can be as low as 800-900 baht). They also fly from/to Udon Thani once a day, the price is 1,000-2,000 baht (2014) and while it's still more expensive than a bus, it's much cheaper than the price of the Lao Airlines flight to Vientiane, which is easily accessible from Udon Thani."
"A subsidiary of the leading Indonesian low-cost carrier, Lion Air, started operations in Thailand in December 2013, and offers attractive fares to Bangkok Don Mueang airport (starting from 820 baht, including snacks and 15 kg check-in baggage) with several flights a day and numerous onward destinations available from Bangkok."
"Flies from/to Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi) (from 2,500 baht, but sometimes there are ""Special offers"" as low as 1,500 baht) and Phuket. In addition, flights to nearby destinations like Nan or Mae Hong Son, while currently not offered, were available seasonally in the past."
"Buses from and to destinations '''outside Chiang Mai Province''' use this station. It has two official terminals, separated by a tuk-tuk stand and a road and tank trap-like obstacles.

"EJS is an ethical and sustainable eco-tourism project located approximately 60km from the city of Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand. Founded in July 2014, it is a joint initiative between members of the Karen hilltribes and Chiang Mai locals who were concerned about the welfare of elephants in Thailand. The Elephant Jungle Sanctuary project also provides many Karen people with employment, education, and financial support. Half-day, full-day, and overnight visits to the sanctuary are available. Weekly volunteering opportunities can also be arranged."
"A renowned sanctuary for rescued and abused elephants, established in 1996 by Lek Chailert, a native Thai woman who has become an internationally-recognized elephant advocate. During a day visit you will feed and bathe the elephants, walk with them around the scenic 50 acre park, and be treated to a vegetarian buffet lunch. Cats and dogs rescued after the tsunami also live at the park, dozing on benches and getting lots of love from visitors. Day and overnight visits as well as one week volunteering opportunities can be booked via the website. Pick up and drop off at your hotel in Chiang Mai."
"Established to create a haven for retired elephants formerly working in building yards, a sustainable habitat for the elephants to live in a safe and natural environment free from profiteering and neglect. Family units are never separated and herbal medicines are used to keep the animals healthy and enjoy a better quality of life. There is no riding or beating of any kind. The main focus of the park is to promote the well-being of retired elephants. Visitors and volunteers can expect to work with the local mahouts to care, feed, and bathe the elephants."
"After a two-day orientation in Chiang Mai, coordinating staff sends volunteers to the elephant camp, roughly a one hour drive from the city. Volunteers stay from Monday to Friday bathing, feeding, caring for and learning about elephants. Lodging is in a tree house on the premises. Two week minimum."
"An elephant camp in the hills about an hour's drive north of the city centre. It has an elephant show, which includes elephants playing football and painting, not natural activities for these creatures. [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-making-an-elephant-paint-is-cruel-not-cute/ ""Like elephants used in the elephant trekking industry, young elephants used for painting must be broken and experience the pain of the phajaan process. Over this time baby elephants are starved, shackled, and beaten, until their spirit is completely broken and will submit to the will of their captors. Once young elephants have undergone this process they can being learning to paint.""] You can also take half-hour or one hour elephant rides."
"As their website states, ""you learn how to ride on its neck."""
"A place of history and remembrance."
"Extremely popular with Thai tourists, and so expect long queues. A large park with over 400 species of animals. While better than some zoos, the animals are nevertheless kept in small enclosures. Operates a dual pricing system wherein non-Thais are charged approximately double the price of Thai nationals. Additional charges also apply for both the panda exhibition and the aquarium. Many of the animals can be fed for a charge of 10 or 20 baht. The park is pretty large and expect plenty of hills if you want to walk the complete route. It's possible to drive through with your car, but not very practical if you want to see the animals up close. If you have a rental scooter or bike, definitely bring it though. The car park facilities are best described as chaotic."
"Set in the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park on the Samoeng Loop. The path winds up for almost 2&nbsp;km to the 8 tiers of cascades. There are many secluded areas off the trail for picnics. Crowded on weekends and holidays."
"This royal winter palace has lavishly landscaped gardens and is open to the public. Dress code strictly applied: dress modestly or pay 15 baht for fisherman's pants to cover your lack of it. This includes ANY leg above the ankle for either gender). The palace itself (built in 1961) is not particularly exciting, but the extensive gardens are picturesque with some amazing plant life, including carefully tended tropical flowers, as well as centuries-old trees and giant bamboo. A sign at the bottom of the hill near the zoo indicates when it's closed. It is close to Wat Prathat Doi Suthep, so travel directions are similar."
"Thailand's oldest and foremost botanical garden. Dedicated to the conservation of Thai flora, it holds collections of, and carries out research on rare and endangered species. Lovely gardens in a mountain foothills setting. Run by the Botanical Garden Association of Thailand."
"A loop trail (2.4 km) leads from the Doi Pui Campsite to Doi Pui peak (uphill!) and back. From the peak you can continue to a View Point (680 m). The whole trail is in the forest and you're above 1500 m, so it's much cooler than in the city during the hot season. Bring insect repellent. To get there, rent a motorbike (or find a songthaew that takes you there) and drive all the way to Phu Ping Palace, continue on the main road, turn right after about 1 km (turning left will bring you to a mountain village) and continue on a narrow windy road for almost 4 km until you reach the Pui Campsite. Alternatively, walk all the way from Phu Ping Palace, there's not much traffic. A sign marks the start of the trail."
"Real muay Thai fights (almost) every Monday and Friday at 20:30 with 10 bouts ranging from young novices to local champions to locals v. foreigners. Spoiler alert: The locals usually win. The smallest of the three stadia it is nearly open-air, but with a new tent covering and good lighting. This is much more authentic than the frenzied beer bar atmosphere of the other two locations."
"Fights are usually held 3-4 nights per week. Look for flyers posted up all over the old city. They usually have about 8 fights and feature Thai fighters as well as a few matches with foreign fighters. This is not the best location to see muay Thai with a family, as it is surrounded by girlie bars and during a break between the fights a group of ladyboys sometimes will dance and occasionally strip. After about 23:00 the complex is opened up for free, letting all the vendors (flower sellers and others) in. If you are on a tight budget you may be able to see a few of the remaining fights for free this way."
"It hosts around 8 fights per show, including a few matches with foreign fighters. This is the largest of the three stadiums and has food as well as beverages served. Gambling is prominently featured."
"This modern multimedia history and cultural education centre has guides dressed in elegant traditional Thai clothing who will usher you into an air-conditioned room to watch an English-subtitled orientation video about Chiang Mai and the north. Next, you will be pointed to a series of rooms documenting the region's history and culture in chronological order from the pre-Muang period (7,000-12,000 years ago) to the early river civilizations, to the early kings through the wars with the Burmese and the last dynasty, to the city today and its plans for the future. Other rooms are devoted to Buddhism and other regional beliefs, agricultural history, hill tribe peoples and other regional cultures, and a run-down of the royal dynasties. The exhibits consist of a smart visual mix of video, scale models, enlarged photos, wall murals and text in Thai and English."
"The history of Chiang Mai."
"There are exhibitions by undergraduates from the Fine Arts Department at Chiang Mai University. These change often and the work on display is of high quality. Each month there is usually at least one art exhibition featuring the works of artists from Southeast Asia. The museum also hosts musical concerts, often free, in the adjoining theatre."
"One of Asia's most unusual museums housing butterflies, beetles and more. Also has a large selection of minerals. Some explanations in English, some in Thai."
"Almost in the centre of Chiang Mai are the remains of a massive chedi that toppled in the great earthquake of 1545. The temple was originally constructed in 1401 on the orders of King Saeng Muang Ma. In 1454, reigning King Tilo-Garaj enlarged the chedi (pronounced ''jedee'') to a height of 86 m. After the earthquake, the chedi lay in ruins until 1991-92, when it was reconstructed at a cost of several million baht. A magnificent testament to Lanna (northern Thai) architecture and art, restored sections hint at its former glory. Wat Chedi Luang is also home to the ""Pillar of the City"", a totem used in ancient Thai fertility rites."
"The oldest royal temple in the city. Presumed to date from the year Chiang Mai was founded (1296), it is famed for two Buddha statues, which are about 1,800 and 1,000 years old, respectively. King Mengrai allegedly lived here while the city of Chiang Mai was being constructed. Enshrined in Wat Chiang Man is a tiny crystal Buddha called Pra Seh-Taang Kamaneeee, which is thought to have the power to bring rain. Another image, called Phra Sila Khoa, reflects the fine workmanship of Indian craftsmen from thousands of years ago."
"An atmospheric temple with two wihan buildings, off the beaten track, quiet and gently crumbling. One of the wihan buildings houses an important Buddha image: ''Phra Buddha Rupa Phra Chao Mengrai''."
"Probably Chiang Mai's best-known temple, housing the Phra Singh image, completed between 1385 and 1400. Of most historical interest is the '''Wihan Lai Kham''' in the back, featuring Lanna-style temple murals and intricate gold patterns on red lacquer behind the altar. The large chedi was built in 1345 by King Pha Yu to house the remains of his father King Kam Fu. A typical scripture repository is located at this temple as well. These repositories were designed to keep and protect the delicate sa or mulberry paper sheets used by monks and scribes to keep records and write down folklore. The high stucco-covered stone base of the repository protected the delicate scriptures from rain, floods, and pests. The walls of the chapel are covered with murals illustrating Lanna customs, dress and scenes from daily life. The lovely Lai Kam chapel houses the revered Phra Singh Buddha image. Sadly, the head was stolen in 1922, and a reproduction is now seen. Your admission ticket is in a leaflet form containing useful information and map of Wat Phra Singh complex. The temple is most attractive during Songkran, the Thai New Year, in mid-April."
"The history and unusual architecture scattered under the yawning canopy of ancient trees is an pleasant antidote to the flash and bustle encountered at popular temples. Established in 1455 to host the eighth World Buddhist Council, many features of the grounds imitate significant places of the Buddha's enlightenment. Originally called ''Botharam Maha Vihata'' in honour of the venerated Bodhi tree, it came to be known as Wat Jet Yod by locals, after the seven spires (''Jet Yod'') protruding from the roof of the Vihara. The square-sided design of the Virhra is a replica of Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya, India, though the translation has distorted proportions somewhat. Remnants of the graceful stucco relief murals that adorned the walls depict angels with a distinctly Indian flavour. The grounds also hold some more recently built, but abandoned looking, eroded chedis and buckling bases of vanished halls, overshadowed by a fully intact, though more diminutive, replica of '''Chedi Luang''' that was built around 1487 to house the ashes of King Tilokarat."
"The quintessential image of Chiang Mai with its large gilded ''chedi'', visible from the city on a clear day. Built in 1383 during the Lanna Thai period, legend has it that the temples site was selected by an elephant sent to roam the mountain side, where upon reaching a suitable spot, it trumpeted, circled three times, knelt down and promptly died, which was interpreted as a sign indicating an auspicious site. The temple offers grand views over the city, but no reward is without effort as you must accent the 200-plus steep steps of the Naga-lined stairs. The climb may be a strain in the high altitude's thin air for the less fit, so you may opt to take the cable car for 20 baht. For the [http://chiangmaibest.com/thai-holidays-festivals/visaka-bucha/ Visaka Bucha holiday] around May each year, it is traditional for people to walk from the zoo to the temple and vast numbers make the pilgrimage to the top, which takes around 4–5 hours.  [[Image:WatDoiSuthepBells.JPG|thumb|Bells at Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep]]  : In the vicinity there are several other attractions you may want to consider visiting. The '''Bhuping Royal Palace Gardens''' are 4&nbsp;km further along the road from Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, with a reasonably easy walk along the meter-wide road shoulder. Or you can get a shared songthaew from Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep for 30 baht, but you may have to wait until it fills up. Further along the road is a '''hill tribe village''', and although tourist-oriented, is really worth the trip. There are many shops for local handicrafts, etc. These are the people from the far north of the country, many originally from Myanmar. There are two areas in the village that require entrance fee: 10 baht to enter a flower garden (where women can take pictures using traditional clothes) and a hill tribe opium museum (the museum is in a very poor condition); and 10 baht to enter the hill tribe waterfall (man-made). [[Image:ChiangMaiHilltribeMarket.jpg|thumb|Market in the hill tribe village]]   : '''Getting there''' is a source of much consternation to many travellers. Clearly marked songthaews leave from Pratu Chang Phuak, next to the 7-Eleven. Prices are listed as 50 baht up and 50 baht down, though once on top the price back down suddenly changes to 60 baht. The drivers wait until they have sufficient (up to 8) passengers before they depart, potentially making for a lengthy wait. Most guidebooks advise taking a songthaew from Mani Nopharat Rd, resulting in the drivers milking the tourist cash-cow and raising their price from a reasonable 40 baht to a ludicrous 500 baht.   : Another option is to take a songthaew from your hotel to the northern gate of Chiang Mai University for 20 baht (if you are close to the city walls), where there will be several songthaews waiting on Huai Kaew Rd to get a full load of passengers for a trip up the mountain. They seem to congregate around the Chiang Mai Zoo, so if you just say ""zoo"" to the driver he will know what you're talking about. Prices range from 40 baht for a one-way trip to Wat Prathat to 180 baht for a full round-trip tour, including the temple, Bhuping Palace Gardens, and the hill tribe village, with an hour at each location, but you may have to wait until there are sufficient people who want the same tour or be prepared to pay more. You can also get between many of these by buying point-to-point tickets at the time you want them, or walking some segment. Any songthaew up the mountain road may be a trial for those prone to motion-sickness, so take appropriate precautions. Also, there may be several little annoying additional costs foreigners. To enter the Doi Suthep itself is free for Thais, and 30 baht for foreigners. Tour operators will ask 700 baht for a tour.   : The journey from the city can be made by motorcycle or a bicycle (with appropriate gearing). The final 12&nbsp;km from the zoo onwards is entirely uphill and will take 60-90 minutes if bicycling."
"A large open-sided hall with a jumble of roughly hewn Buddhas with a huge dazzlingly whitewashed chedi behind."
"The name means ""tunnel temple"". An ancient temple in the forest just outside Chiang Mai. King Mengrai built this temple for a highly respected forest monk who liked to wander in the countryside, hence the isolated location where the monk could stay quietly and meditate. It is unusual in that it has tunnel-like chambers in the ground, some of the walls of which still have the original paintings of birds and animals visible. The large stupa is magnificent, and there is an eerie statue of a fasting, emaciated Buddha next to it. You can also take a break by the ponds, where you can feed the fish and turtles. Has a meditation centre open to foreigners. Some monks and the abbot speak a little English."
"Offers many alternative experiences with locals, including things like glass blowing workshop, scrap metal welding workshop, silversmithing class, fishing with locals and many more. An award-winning social enterprise based throughout Southeast Asia connecting you with highly skilled artisans and locals who will show you something different. Great for those looking for something different and fans of community tourism."
"Screens French films, but frequently sub-titled in English. See the website for calendar of showings. The alliance also has an extensive library as well as exhibitions."
"Ticket prices vary depending on the duration of the film. The place is not very popular among the locals since it is a bit old and worn. Most showings are in Thai, only a few a day in English."
"Ticket prices depend on the duration of the film and seat type. Honeymoon seats generally cost 40 baht more than standard seats. If you would like to avoid the crowd, avoid going on Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights. Make sure to check the language of the film prior to booking. Some children's movies are dubbed into Thai."
"Takes place around the third weekend of Jan at Ban Bo Sang, Sankampang. The festival is in the form of a ""street fair"" in which the central road of the village is used, with shops on both sides. Shops are decorated in Lanna-style, most with the well-known umbrellas, as well as with traditional lanterns. In addition there are contests, exhibitions, cultural performances, local entertainment, and assorted shows day and night. There is a grand procession decorated with umbrellas and local products, a variety of handicrafts for sale, northern-style khantoke meals and the Miss Bo Sang pageant."
"Staged every year during the first weekend in February (in 2014 it was held Friday-Sunday, 7–9 February). The city is awash with vibrant colours ranging from the electric orange and lilac colours of the bougainvillea to the velvety blossoms of petunias in all shades of pink, white, and purple. The strident red of the poinsettias, bought by many at Christmas and New Year, is echoed by beds of scarlet salvias. Homes and shop owners alike line the city streets with colourful flower boxes. The sheer profusion of colour that the flower festival and carnival brings to Chiang Mai aptly gives the city its name ""Rose of the North"". On all three days of the festival, prize blooms are on display at Nong Buak Had Park near the city centre. Many types of flower, miniature trees and orchida are put on display for the judges to choose the best of the species. Landscape specialists put on an elaborate display, which includes patios and waterfalls with exotic decorative plants and flowers. The best part of the flower festival is on Saturday. The parade lines up from the train station to Nawarat Bridge so the police close most of Charoen Muang Rd around 08:00. The VIP viewing stand is right next to the bridge in front of the Chiang Mai Governor's home. The parade route goes up Tha Phae Rd to the gate and turns left and follows the moat to Nong Buak Had Park. The parade moves at a slow pace and stops several times so there is plenty of time to take pictures of the colourful floats, pretty girls and hill tribe people in native costume. The paraders hand out roses to spectators lining the road. When the parade finishes everyone heads to Nong Buak Had where all the floats, award-winning flower growers and landscape projects are all on display. There are plenty of food stalls in the park, and in the late afternoon the Miss Chiang Mai Flower Festival starts. The party goes well into the evening until the new Flower Festival Queen has been chosen. This is a great time to visit Chiang Mai, as the air is cool and the evenings fresh and clear. If you want to see the festival make sure you book your hotels and flights well in advance."
"City Pillar Festival in Chiang Mai. This is a six-day festival where the city pillar spirits are propitiated to ensure the continuity of the city. Occurs in May or Jun as part of the Northern Thailand lunar calendar. Very large event focused around Wat Chedi Luang."
"If you like candles placed in colourful paper lanterns, fireworks, beautiful girls in traditional dress, parade floats, lots of food and parties. Don't miss the Loi Krathong festival, which in Chiang Mai lasts for 3 full days, the last night being that of the 12th full moon of the year (which is usually in Nov). In the small town of Mae Jo, north of Chiang Mai, they start the festival on Saturday night by simultaneously launching thousands upon thousands of hot air balloons called ''khom loi''. Loi Krathong coincides with the northern Thai (Lanna) festival known as ""Yi Peng"" (ยี่เป็ง). Due to a difference between the old Lanna calendar and the Thai calendar, Yi Peng is held on a full moon of the 2nd month of the Lanna calendar (""Yi"" meaning ""2nd"" and ""Peng"" meaning ""month"" in the Lanna language). A multitude of Lanna-style sky lanterns (khom loi (โคมลอย), literally: ""floating lanterns"") are launched into the air where they drift with the winds. The festival is meant as a time for ""tam-bun"" (ทำบุญ), to make merit. People decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with khom fai (โคมไฟ): intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. Khom thue (โคมถือ) are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, khom khwaen (โคมแขวน) are the hanging lanterns, and khom pariwat (โคมปริวรรต) which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. Chiang Mai has the most elaborate Yi Peng celebrations, where both Loi Krathong and Yi Peng are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating by in the sky."
"A huge lantern release (It is often referred to as the 10,000 lantern release, but there are not as many as that) happens near Mae Jo University on the Saturday before Loi Krathong, in 2013: 16 Nov. The DMC Buddhist Sect puts this on and though it is billed as ""for local people"" this event has no connection with Chiang Mai or Lanna events, and is not promoted by local government officials nor included in their program. The lantern release takes place at the end of a ceremony that begins at 18:30, with the release at 20:00. The event is free of charge, but respectful attire is required and alcohol is forbidden. A tourist-targeted event (which costs about 3,000 baht) occurs in the same location on the following weekend."
"The Thai Water Festival is celebrated as the Thai new year from 13-15 Apr (though it may begin a day or two early). The most obvious sign that you're in the middle of the festival is when you get soaked by someone pouring a bucket of water over you, or squirting you with a water gun. This tradition evolved from people tossing water that had been poured over holy statues, since this water was expected to be good luck. Now, it takes the form of a free-for-all water fight, and you will undoubtedly be drenched. It's also a way of staying cool during the very hot and humid month of April. Put your mobile phone in a plastic bag."
"A small and very cosy massage shop close to the Iron Bridge. Clean, friendly and professional, Fah Lanna gets consistently high ratings in customer reviews. First, customers get a gentle foot-bath with scrub and comfortable clothes to change into and after the massage they are offered ginger tea and a cold towel.

"A large covered arcade full of shops with an open food court and entertainment area. The food court operates on a coupon system: you buy coupons from the cashiers, then redeem them at the many small adjacent food stalls. Cheap dining. The market has bars, many shops, massage shops."
"If the Night Bazaar is the place tourists go at night, Malin Plaza is where young Thais go. It's proximity to มช (""maw chaw"", the local nickname for CMU) means that in the evening this place is crawling with teens and twenty-somethings. Clothing is young, trendy and cheap. Cheap restaurants abound, including a number of all-you-can-eat table-top barbecues, usually priced about 175 baht per person."
"A huge indoor/outdoor commercial maelstrom centred on the '''Night Bazaar Building''' on the west side of Changklan Rd. The Night Bazaar can be considered an entire region of the city as it incorporates the Anusarn and Kalare Markets as well, with the borders being ambiguous (and unimportant). It can take a concerted effort to find something different among the near identical stalls selling tourist-oriented sunglasses, T-shirts, textiles, watches, luggage, caps, and anything else small enough to sell from a market stall. You rarely see Thai people shopping here. On the east side of the street you will find the Anusarn and Kalare Markets with wider offerings."
"Just south of the moat's northeast corner. Mostly a fruit and veg market for locals, but close at hand to the many guesthouses in the area so a good place for visitors to stock up on grub. Lots of prepared meat and meals as well."
"This market is enormous and takes up several blocks on either side of Ratchadamnoen including from Ratchawithi to Ratchamanka on Prapoklao (from the 3 Kings Monument to past Wat Chedi Luang). The street is blocked off to traffic for local craft vendors to layout their handmade wares. There are food vendors strewn throughout. It starts at 16:00, but not everyone is set up until around 18:00. Runs late, but most vendors start to pack up around 22:00 or so."
"This sprawling indoor/outdoor market is where the locals shop and is worth a visit to look over the plethora of fabrics, spices, tea, and dried fruit piled up along the aisles. Across the road is a flower and fruit market and an out-of-this-world fireworks stand. At night the street is packed with snack stalls."
"In the old silver-working district, it's a smaller version of the Sunday market with many of the same vendors."
"Tam, a lovely Thai lady, and Tony, her British partner, run a motorbike rental service combined with a coffee shop, bar, and restaurant. He's a bike expert. She's expert in people, creating great food and a convivial ambience. Excellent coffee, food, and bikes. Weekly and monthly rentals available."
"A busy outdoor night market with lots of little Thai, Indian and Western restaurants and food vendors. Great atmosphere."
"Has a large open-air food court, featuring free Thai classical dance performances nightly. All food is paid for with pre-purchased coupons."
"Dozens of food carts set up every evening around from around 17:00 until about 22:00, with a huge variety of very inexpensive food, and tables set up along the pavement."
"Local handmade coffee from a local hill tribe. Fantastic Thai family cooking. All fresh and made by hand, great atmosphere and music, low-cost food. Genuine owner who will keep you informed of all the natural products you should eat. The yellow curry is recommended."
"Serves authentic ''kuaytiow reua'' (literally ""boat noodles"", rice noodles in dark broth with beef). It's good stuff."
"Delicious food at really low prices. Friendly staff."
"Lucky Pub is on the ground floor. The restaurant is above and to the rear. The bar opens and 16:00 and closes at 02:00. The restaurant opens at 18:00 and closes at 08:00 the next morning. This is its appeal. When everything else is closed at 03:00 and you're hungry, this is one of the only places to go. Thai food only. Free Wi-Fi in the bar."
"A variety of Thai meals, for breakfast and lunch. The food is excellent and the owners and staff are very pleasant and helpful."
"Popular for its wide range of Thai dishes and a huge vegetarian selection. Both smoking (inside, air-conditioned) and non-smoking areas. Visa/MasterCard accepted."
"Great Thai food, good atmosphere, friendly staff and free billiards."
"Delicious food (Thai, Western and vegetarian), friendly service and simple and relaxed atmosphere."
"Highlights are lemon grass beef, sun-dried beef and chili crab. See the bar blackboard for daily specials."
"Wooden Lanna style buildings in a very nice garden. They have Northern Thai-style food only."
"Specialises in Northern Thai food, and is popular with both Thais and foreigners. Lunch in the air-conditioned hall is decent enough, but dinner in the profusely decorated old house in the back is little short of magical. Best of all is the price: a bowl of ''khanom jiin naam ngiaw'' (Shan-style pork rib noodles), a plate of ''som tum'' (green papaya salad) and some sticky rice will cost less than 100 baht. Portions are small however. This place is featured in Chinese guidebooks, thus in high-season it will be thronged with Chinese making it difficult to get seated without a lengthy wait."
"Terrific restaurant on a prominent corner of the Anusarn Market. It is very popular with Chinese visitors who are quick to spot a good deal. There are some excellent vegetarian choices. Great staff, huge menu."
"Fresh seafood and a wide selection of Thai and northern/Lanna specialties. Operated by two sisters."
"Thai food and grilled specialties, some of them regional, in a delightful outdoor setting."
"Traditional northern Thai cuisine. To get a good seat reservations are recommended."
"The first commercial khantoke dinner in Chiang Mai more than 30 years ago. They have the best northern Thai food of any of the khantoke establishments. However the seating, show and music are not as good as others."
"Brightly-lit with just stools and a counter in an open shop."
"A small and new western-style food stand selling Southern-US style fried chicken and chicken burgers. Tasty and cheap."
"Choose any of the ingredients on their list and they'll make a sandwich for you how you like it. They also serve breakfasts and have bagels."
"Some say the baguettes are better than in France, which is nonsense, but they may well be the best in Thailand. Very well-run establishment, with outstanding food, great staff and ambience. Owners, Mark and Sa."
"It's hard to find an early-morning breakfast in Chiang Mai due to the number of tourists on hotel package deals, but this place does. Free Wi-Fi. Three coin-operated Internet computers, 10 baht for 15 minutes."
"American-style burger and steakhouse. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, music videos and sports on three 10 foot screens, pool tables and free Internet, free popcorn and peanuts, over 50 kinds of margaritas, Chang beer on tap. Is open everyday from breakfast until late. Another outlet at 80/1 Loi Kroh Rd."
"Possibly the best value in Chiang Mai. Wonderful ambiance, with indoor or outdoor seating. Great food, cocktails and desserts at more than reasonable prices. Cooking classes offered on-site. Also has a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house for rent at 3,000 baht per day."
"Excellent American-style dishes and desserts: ribs, burgers, pizza, cheesecake, etc. Full bar with local and imported beers and wines. Great family atmosphere, children's menu, no loud music or entertainment, just good food. Eat in, take away & call for delivery. The flagship restaurant is at 49/4-5 Chiang Mai-Lamphun Rd, south of the Nawarat Bridge, 50&nbsp;m N of TAT. A third is in the Promenada Shopping Centre."
"Authentic French restaurant in the centre of the old city. Large selection of imported meats and wines at affordable prices. Romantic open-air seating area with upstairs art gallery."
"A favourite with Westerners because of the great service, good English, nice aesthetics and delicious food and drinks."
"Delicious cocktails and excellent Western and Thai food. Has inside (air conditioned) and outside (smoking) seating. The interior closely resembles an authentic pub. This place does all the small things well: Tabasco, Lea & Perrins on the tables, soap and towels in the toilets, spotlessly clean. Not cheap, but the food is superb and the portions generous. Free Wi-Fi."
"Spotlessly clean and excellent Western/Thai food at great prices. Terrific pizza at 69 baht a huge slice. Friendly, accommodating staff. Free Wi-Fi."
"Serves great Mediterranean-style food. Greece, Turkey, Italy are all represented. Tapas, budget pork and chicken steaks."
"Draught Guinness and Heineken, imported Blackthorn Cider and Fuller's London Pride, and Belgian and German beers. Pub favourites including bangers 'n mash, fish 'n chips, steak & kidney pie as well as steaks, pasta and Thai food. Live sports on a HD big screen including Premier League Football, Aussie Rules, Rugby and Formula 1."
"Order by completing a form which is then handed to the staff. Fast and efficient, and the food is very good. Second location on 5F of Central Festival Mall. Third location on Chaiyapoom Rd, just E of the moat."
"Authentic Bavarian specialities."
"Open for lunch and dinner with a range of traditional Italian soup, pasta, antipasti, meat and vegetarian dishes. Homemade ice cream, 35 baht per serving."
"Old 1930s colonial style house in the city centre. Western and Thai food, Pacific Rim and fusion. Free Wi-Fi. Shop with unusual houseware items on the premises."
"Open lunch & dinner amid beautiful surroundings. Serving residents for over 15 years. Menu and recipes on website. Reservations recommended. Call for free transportation."
"Free Wi-Fi. Smoking and non-smoking areas. Charming restaurant with a tiny front but a cavernous interior. Good food at good prices. Those unfamiliar with Burmese food are in for a treat."
"The name means ""amazing taste"", and it's true of this place. Spotless, delicious and inexpensive, the only downside is that it has strange hours and is not open on weekends. Informative website with complete menu in Thai and English."
"While perhaps not a special restaurant in that it is not unique to Chiang Mai (it's actually a large chain), for those seeking reasonably-priced Japanese food, Fuji is a must. Expect to pay 120 baht and up for each dish (for instance, a single sushi roll), however there are several spectacular set meals that offer superb value, e.g., the Fuji Sashimi Set which can easily fill up a sushi lover for 190 baht."
"Owned and managed by a cute Japanese-Thai husband and wife team, this restaurant is known as the best Japanese restaurant among Japanese residents in Chiang Mai. Although the menu is limited, ingredients are always fresh, cooking and presentation are excellent. Lunch is best value, with set meals around 140-200 baht."
"A little hidden in a side street, but visible from the main road near Tha Phae Gate. Delicious and very good value (250 baht will fill you)."
"Reasonably priced sushi, sashimi, and standard sushi bar Japanese meals. This is the first Sushi Box in Chiang Mai, there are five in Phuket. Mainly Thai crowd, moderately priced, lounge upstairs, great for people watching. Open 11:00-23:00. Can get busy at night."
"Modern and friendly Korean barbecue spot offering high quality beef and pork as well as other Korean traditional dishes. Great artwork on the colourful walls and groovy tunes floating over the conversations. The staff are very attentive and the owners can give a quick Korean lesson."
"Excellent vegetarian food, perhaps the best in Chiang Mai."
"Thai and Western, huge selection of items for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great salads, fruits, fruit juices, noodle dishes, bakery, good breads."
"Lebanese owner/chef caters to middle eastern food lovers. Large portions of delicious tabbouleh, tahini salads and humus alongside fresh falafel and flat bread. Shisha/nargila/water pipes are available as well as mint tea."
"A mix of Thai and other styles, run by laconic locals linked to a local farm. The falafel is lovely, but different, and the salsa it comes with is delicious. Pasta can be quite sweet, and the biscuits are good."
"A different range of Thai vegan dishes from the norm. A focus on faux-meats, the veggie sausage is great, and the faux-fish in curry sauce is good. Of course, bamboo shoot stir fry, noodle soups, etc., means there's lots to try. They cook during the day, so other dishes often appear from the kitchen."
"Delicious vegan buffet at low prices. There are a few great dishes: the tofu, mushroom, and lemon grass wrapped in banana leaves is addictive; the het-hom (shitake) and other protein/gluten goodies are lovely; the steaming noodle soup is a great addition to a meal if you've arrived late and want to warm up the buffet dishes. The earlier the better as when dishes run out, they aren't remade. Also, you can buy some vegan supplies."
"Thai vegetarian with organic ingredients from local farmers and many vegan-friendly options. Run by a local self-reliance and seed-saving centre outside the city."
"Thai vegetarian with vegan options. Owned by a friendly English expat, this restaurant offers curries and noodle dishes in a comfortable and clean setting, with both indoor and garden seating."
"Handsome 2 storey restaurant with air-con upstairs. Serves what amounts to Vietnamese tapas: spring rolls, salted pork ribs, nem; all with lots of leafy greens. Serve beer, but the fresh fruit juices are better. Do very little to cater to visitors as most everything is in Thai including signs and menus. At the entry have a shop that offers many of their products packaged for take-away. The website lists their catering offerings."
"A tiny, hole-in-the-wall (~15 seat) cocktail bar that just may serve the best cocktails in Chiang Mai. Certainly the best price/performance. Run by Ben, an irrepressible, animal-loving, lovely female and her partner, Keng. She is especially proud of her mojitos, but all the 270 cocktails on offer are delicious. The conversation is good too as she speaks excellent English. Free Wi-Fi."
"On the 21st floor of the hotel, this is as high as you can go in Chiang Mai to have a drink. Good views all round. Serves full range of cocktails, also Thai and Western food. Take the lift to the 20th floor, then hike up a not-very-inviting staircase to the open rooftop. It can't compare with the fabulous rooftop bars of Bangkok, but it's the best Chiang Mai has to offer."
"A nightly revue, dancing to Western tunes by ladyboys in lavish costumes. The one hour show is tame and family-friendly, with children frequently in the audience. Lots of dancing to ABBA tunes and extravagant costumes, with no nudity. The show's length is perfect and the price is surprising affordable. Good fun. Happy Hour precedes the show, 19:30-20:30, and also follows the show."
"One of the smaller bars at the top of Loi Kroh but also one of the most cosy. What really make this place stand out is the friendly staff and that this bar has two floors so you can get away from the bustle of street level and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere from the balcony."
"Great expat bar. Free Wi-Fi with electrical outlets spaced at one metre intervals under the bar. They specialise in Belgian beer as well as having eight draught beers on tap, including domestic and Guinness. Excellent kitchen serving Thai and farang food, although the latter can be pricy: pad Thai is 80 baht, while the cheeseburger is expensive at 250 baht (July 2015). Number 1 is a refuge in Chiang Mai's red light district as it has no bar girls hassling you for a drink. And it's one of the few places on Loi Kroh where you can comfortably take a date. Two excellent pool tables, 20 baht per game (July 2015)."
"Pub and restaurant near Chiang Mai University, there are many zones in the restaurant: coffee shop, dining outdoors near the small pond, dining indoors with live music."
"Long-established English-style pub, has had a makeover and extended the bar and the restaurant, but kept its charm. Great selection of food and drinks, including roast dinners on Sundays. Has an outside area where you can sit and enjoy the tranquillity of a tropical garden, and has recently added bungalows for those wishing to linger longer."
"This chain bar/restaurant/club has several venues in Thailand. The venue in Chiang Mai is a lot less touristy and the dance hall packed to the brim with Thai students."
"A decent wine bar with comfortable seating and relaxing music, a great escape from the busy street scene."
"Sports bar with many regulars and tourists. Darts and pool area, big TV, really nice international cuisine, especially the burgers, but also good Thai and Indian dishes. Excellent (can be loud) music, friendly atmosphere and beautiful women."
"An old fashioned bar and restaurant purportedly for SE Asia's community of authors, journalists and screenwriters, though everyone's welcome. A good, informal source of information about SE Asia. This is where the some of those writing guidebooks gather."
"Very large indoor/outdoor bar and club with a dance floor, live music or DJ, including lots of outdoor seating and multiple bars. If you're looking to party with foreigners in Chiang Mai, this is the place to be. Closes exactly at midnight except on special occasions, such as New Year or Songkran."
"The noisy location is made up for by the excellent espresso. Internet is free, and the ""fishbowl"" inside is both air conditioned and soundproofed against the rush of traffic."
"At this location they roast the coffee for their outlets."
"They roast their own beans."
"Run by ""Oil"", this little place has excellent espresso-based drinks, free Wi-Fi, or ten minutes on the computer with your coffee. Very modern design; seating in the front is open-air while the back is air conditioned. Oil herself speaks excellent English and is happy to give you the low-down."
"A trendy art cafe featuring an award-winning barista, choices of single-origin beans and a varied drink menu. Very friendly atmosphere at much higher standard than is normally seen in Thailand."
"Looks much like a Starbucks. Nice mugs if you drink it there. Several other locations in and around Chiang Mai. Inside is well air-conditioned, outside is under a canopy (they mist water in the heat of the afternoon). The staff pride themselves on their decorative drinks (look for the panda-topped latte). Internet available for small fee."
"Outdoor garden bar and restaurant serving Lebanese, Western and Thai food. Popular meeting place for gay expats and tourists."
"Northern Thai-style outdoor gay bar and restaurant. Packed with very friendly staff and fun atmosphere."
"Gay expats, tourists, and Thai men."
"The owner, ""Boy"", plays great blues guitar and is a nephew of Chiang Mai legend ""Took"", of the now defunct Brasserie. Monday night is jamming night and some great visiting musicians have made this often memorable. Bangkok blues legend, Chai (of Chai's Blues Bar fame), often joins in. Well worth a visit."
"Live music every night, except Monday: Brit pop, rock, Thai. Mostly Thais go to this bar but you will as well see some expats, ages: 22-32. Service is excellent and if you happen to go there by yourself, for sure someone will come up to talk to you. The menu includes delicious cocktails: ""Mango Kiss"", ""Velvet""! Cheap beer & Sangsom (Thai rum) as well as snacks. The outside sitting area is perfect if you want to talk."
"Thai and Western varieties of rock, jazz, pop and country music in the evening. Their extensive menu offers more than 150 Thai, Chinese, and Western dishes, including curries, noodles, rice and pizza. Full-service bar serving wine, beer and spirits. If you want to get in, get there early and there's a queue every night."
"Nightly jazz performances starting around 21:30 with different performers and occasional guests from the audience. Mixed bag in terms of quality: sometimes great, sometimes mediocre. Serves a variety of drinks not normally found in Chiang Mai, notably red and white wine, mojitos and other mixed drinks. The staff are quick and efficient, and the prices are reasonable."
"The live music starts around 19:00 with dinner music from the Eagles, Beatles or soft jazz. Starting at 21:00, the music changes to more rock and pop. The restaurant gets very crowded, so arrive early to get a table. The Riverside also offers a nightly dinner cruise departing at 20:00 for 110 baht/person extra."
"Live jazz on Saturdays."
"A small club with live band, DJ, and huge screens showing music videos. Good for drinking nights and letting loose. Bring ID/passport as they can be strict about entry, especially on weekends."
"A Thai place with live music most nights, reasonable drink prices and no cover charge for foreigners or locals."
"A hectic after-hours place with good drinks, dancing and lots of girls looking to party. Be forewarned, many are bar girls (the place doesn't get rocking until they get off at 02:00) so do not be surprised if they ask for money to go home with you."
"This establishment triples as a hostel and a local drinking spot. It's run by a Thai-American man and a Chinese man. Free coffee at any time of the day or night. Complimentary use of the washing machine and kitchen. Nineteen rooms that can house 38. Two showers and three toilets are located on each of the five floors. Rooms contain two pod-style bunkbeds."
"Newly renovated guest house, but somehow already a bit worn. 2 single (150 baht), 4 double (180-220 baht) and 1 triple rooms (250 baht). Singles can be a bit mouldy due to poor drainage and ventilation. Good hot shower (private for single rooms, shared for double and triple). Terrace. Free Wi-Fi. If they have a laptop free you can borrow it to take to your room. Fan in rooms. Kitchen free to use. Soft beds. Service also available in German. Help with booking trips, treks, motorbikes and other things. Friendly staff."
"Simple, but cosy Thai hotel. Fan rooms are often sold out, however 299 baht for an air-con room with TV and small balcony is an excellent value during hot or wet season. No Wi-Fi (but Truemove 850&nbsp;MHz 3G works perfectly). While the hotel is not far from the centre, the closest place where you can catch a public songthaew (near Kad Suan Kaew Mall) is almost 1&nbsp;km away, so the place is better suited for those who rent a motorbike. Free parking. On the nearby intersection with Hasadhisawee Rd, there are numerous and cheap food stalls in the evening. Hotel staff generally do not speak English. If no vacancy, there's Inthanon Hotel next on the same road, priced ~50 baht more."
"Small and simple guest house attached to the back of a pleasant but moderately priced cafe and restaurant. Friendly staff, shared basic Western bathrooms with warm shower, shared with cafe so can get heavy use at peak times. Good Wi-Fi in rooms. Fan dorm 100 baht, air-con dorm 150 baht, double fan room 200 baht, double air-con room 350 baht."
"Thai modern-style guest house with terrace, comfortable rooms with double windows overlook a mountain panorama."
"A 10-minute walk to the temples and Loi Kroh Rd, and a minute walk to the Sunday night market. Owner and staff are welcoming, friendly, can cater to your personal needs, and also make you feel at home."
"'''Two''' guest houses. Cheap basic rooms, hot showers, free Wi-Fi, free shared computer, free bicycles, free water, reggae bar attached (Freedom Bar 16:00-24:00). Can book everything here and sightsee by bicycle. Kitchen with cooking lessons available and massage school 200&nbsp;m away. Watch out for the 300 baht room ""switch"" after they pick you up in the airport. They will give you this price in front of the guesthouse."
"Guesthouse with a roof-top garden, Internet café and large screen TV in the lobby. Beautifully decorated and designed with elegant wood floors throughout the building. Choice of fan and air-con rooms with shared or private bathrooms."
"Family-style guesthouse, fan or air-con rooms, and with a tropical garden on the banks of the Mae Ping River."
"Popular guesthouse in a quiet part of the old city near Tha Phae Gate. This guesthouse is notorious for filling quickly, quite often by 09:00, as it is listed in some guide books. The lounge area is often full of travellers. Food and drinks are served. The in-house travel agency make different types of bookings for you. Free Wi-Fi, but it doesn't always work."
"All rooms have fan and private bathroom with hot water. Hidden in a quiet alley. Free Wi-Fi."
"East of Tha Phae Gate, easily accessible on songthaew routes. Very clean rooms. The guest house also offers many trekking tours. The staff speak German, English and Thai. Family-like atmosphere. Cheap and very good food around the clock, freshly made."
"Cheap basic dorms with hot shower and free Wi-Fi. An easy place to meet people in a good location."
"Really friendly and helpful staff. Centrally located, clean and good prices for dorms and rooms. Rooms have dedicated bathrooms that, strangely, are not en suite, but all across the hallway. Keep an eye out for room rates changing after you've already checked-in (e.g., +100 baht). Don't be a wimp when this happens."
"A small cosy family-run guest house."
"A basic but clean inn along the Ping River near Nakorn Ping Bridge and the yellow songthaew route. Hot showers, two bottles of free drinking water, towels, roof access, cable, and free Wi-Fi. If the foot bridge over the river ever gets fixed, the Ping River Inn will be within five minutes walking distance of Warorot Market."
"De facto motorcyclist headquarters in Chiang Mai. Clean and comfortable. Full restaurant and bar. Five rooms and frequently fully booked. Free Wi-Fi. Secure parking for motorcycles. English owner is helpful and free with information. Sells good maps of north Thailand."
"A family-run guest house on a popular, but quiet lane. Fan and air-con rooms, all with bathrooms and hot water. Free Wi-Fi."
"Perhaps the friendliest little guest house in Chiang Mai. Beloved by backpackers for its low cost and friendly atmosphere. Mim, the owner, gives a free meal for guests every night. She is also an expert chef, and Spicy House sometimes acts as a cooking school. It is in the centre of the Chiang Mai action, but down a quiet soi where you can withdraw from it when needed."
"Family-run guesthouse. Friendly. Excellent value/location combination. Basic double rooms with baths, hot water & small TV. Free Wi-Fi. Common area with tables so you can bring food and eat. Refreshments for sale on-premises. Basic double air-con room with en suite shower was 350 baht as of Nov 2013 (no fridge, old furniture, but generally clean)."
"88 rooms and dormitory. Restaurant, swimming pool, coffee shop, massage."
"Dead central, and probably the cleanest hotel in Chiang Mai. Extremely friendly staff (only a few of whom speak English). Security entrance. A short walk to the Tha Phae Gate in the old city (nice central location). Monthly rentals are available at 7,500 baht with a 5,000 baht deposit (on top of the 7,500 baht, there are additional charges: electricity is 7 baht per kilowatt, 600 baht for unlimited Internet, 200 baht for cable TV, and 200 baht for water). Location is great. Just around the corner is a great little cafe called ""Angel's"" which serves a mix of Thai food and really great Western breakfasts. The location of the hotel is also a short walk to several excellent restaurants and cafes such as the UN Irish Pub, New Delhi Indian Restaurant, and Loco Elvis Tex-Mex."
"A mid-sized hotel with a small fitness centre and pool."
"Up-scale place built like a Spanish villa."
"With only 3 detached Thai-style bungalows in a private garden, this has to be the smallest boutique hotel with the biggest swimming pool in Chiang Mai. Very friendly and helpful staff. Each room has air-con, TV, Wi-Fi, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and access to 3 swimming pools."
"Very central, clean and bright rooms. Excellent quality. Free Wi-Fi in room."
"Small boutique guesthouse with patio and garden. Free bicycle use for guests. English, French, and Spanish speaking staff. Each room has air-con and fan, cable TV, free Wi-Fi, safe."

"Beautifully decorated guest house on the northern outskirts of the city that was built from scratch by a Belgian couple. Offers comfortable and spacious rooms with air conditioning, a pool, and a nice dining area for meals. One can find plenty of places nearby to eat and drink as residents in the village setup tables outside of their homes and operate small-time restaurants and bars. Provides a good mix of comfortable lodging with hosts that fluently speak several languages. Also pet-friendly. Free shuttle service from Chiang Mai."
"Oddly named, but a superior accommodation. Close to shops, bars, restaurants, the Night Bazaar. Spotlessly clean, if somewhat austere. Run by the affable Mr Pong, who speaks good English. Great plumbing, showers, large flat screen TVs with Western programmes, fridge. Secure, covered parking for those turning up with expensive rides. Highly recommended. Free, excellent free Wi-Fi."
"Good rooms, air-con, hot water, bar fridge and TV."
"Spacious and clean. Standard, deluxe and superior rooms available for daily/weekly/monthly rates. Internet (Wi-Fi/LAN), air-con, hot showers. New building, modern rooms. In the trendy Nimmanhaemin district across from shopping mall and 5-10 minute walking distance to night life, cafes, restaurants."
"Nicely decorated loft/ industrial design guesthouse. Double and twin rooms. All rooms with air conditioning, mini-fridge, 32 inch led TV, private bath room with rain shower, free wiffi and free breakfast included in price."
"A wooden house which is simply decorated to create a peaceful atmosphere. The rooms are beautifully decorated."
"Nice guest house with air conditioning, TV, private shower, fridge and a little balcony. Try getting a room on the street side, since the other side has a water pump working during the night which can be annoying in some rooms."
"Newly renovated (as of 2015) wooden northern Thai-style guesthouse. It touts its ""extremely friendly and helpful"" staff, which it says speak English and French provide great tourist information."
"Deluxe serviced-apartments for daily rental. Offer a wide range of services and some degree of security. In a somewhat remote NW area of the city."
"Only 6 rooms in a beautifully restored old Thai house set in a small garden. Air-con, hot water."
"Excellent luxury hotel with cheap(er) Internet rates. Popular with tour groups and conventions. The Internet here is slow and not included in the room rate. Probably a little cheaper than similar hotels as it's near the beer bar district, but the area is quite safe and the hotel is high quality. For those not staying at the hotel, for 300 baht per day, you can use the excellent gym on the fourth floor (includes a gender-segregated Jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna, as well as a large L-shaped swimming pool that looks out on the city centre)."
"In the traditional Lanna-style, this 24 hectare (60 acre) resort includes a spa, cooking classes, children's club, and fitness centre. The resort caused some local controversy when it built a reproduction temple based on one of Thailand's most holy sites on its grounds."
"Luxury hotel in traditional Lanna-style with 375 rooms and suites, a convention centre, sauna rooms, outdoor swimming pool, business centre and massage parlour. Good breakfast and friendly staff."
"The hotel is connected to the Tweechol Botanical Garden, a private garden of 50 hectares. The garden has many animal shaped shrubs. Former US president Jimmy Carter stayed here when in Thailand for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_%26_Rosalynn_Carter_Work_Project Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project]."
"Nicely designed with hand-carved fretwork."
"A luxury boutique resort on the bank of the Mae Ping River and the centre of Chiang Mai. Only minutes away from Chiang Mai Airport and the Night Bazaar."

"From Huay Xai also there are slow (2-day) and fast (6-8 hr) boats ply the Mekong to Luang Prabang. Buses are also available to Luang Prabang and north to Luang Namtha."
"Best known for their border markets. A popular place to pop over the border for a few hours before renewing your Thai visa. Note that there are no consular services so you cannot get a new visa here. It is possible to get a 14-day Thai visa on re-entry to Thailand which can come in very handy if you do not have any time left on your current Thai visa. The Myanmar fee for a same day entry permit is USD10 or 500 baht, and so it is better to use USD. Many people buy Western alcohol, especially wine, while in Myanmar due to the very large duties imposed in Thailand."
"A luxury scheduled airline, flying small jets between Lunken Airport in Cincinnati and Chicago, New York City, Charlotte, and Cleveland. Given the high price of conventional air service, sometimes this option is reasonably priced by comparison."
"All incoming and outgoing passenger trains stop at Union Terminal/Cincinnati Museum Center during the night. The station is one mile from downtown Cincinnati and since all trains arrive before public transportation is available it may be wise to call a taxi to finish your journey (See Taxis.). Cincinnati is served by the thrice-weekly ''Cardinal'' service between New York City/Washington, D.C and Chicago."
"Greyhound offers passenger bus service from many U.S. cities. Buses arrive and depart from Greyhound's station in downtown Cincinnati."

Megabus also stops at the University of Cincinnati (on the corner of West University Avenue and Commons Way) on the way to the Downtown stop listed above. The University Stop has a little better transit connections to Metro buses than the Gest Street location which is in kind of an isolated area. Fares can only be bought online."
"See above entry for most details. Until local politicians decide that having the Megabus stop in the virtually unused multi-million dollar climate controlled ''Riverfront Transit Center'' by ""The Banks"" downtown would be a good investment for tourism, the University stop may be a better idea than going to Gest Street with Megabus as its far more integrated into an actual neighborhood, far less isolated, and has relatively easy local transit bus connectivity."
"College student oriented bus service that offers destinations throughout Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia, notably OSU and Miami Oxford. Like Megabus there is free wi-fi and express service. Be careful when selecting your destination as they have an arrangement with Greyhound and you could be using a Greyhound bus if going to a more distant destination, look for GLI on the ticket to see if you are getting a Greyhound."
"The Carew Tower served as the basis for the design of the later Empire State Building. During the mid- to late-1980s, a giant inflatable gorilla was attached to the upper floors! Notice the Art Deco interior of the common areas as you follow the signs to find the elevators. You have to change elevators and then take the stairs up the final level to make it to the 49th floor. The 49th floor of Cincinnati's 2nd tallest building provides a breathtaking, inexpensive, and gorilla-less view of the city. Take a high-speed elevator to the 45th floor, then choose from walking up four flights of stairs or taking another elevator to the 48th floor and walking up one flight. The admission is collected once you reach the top."

This bridge was featured in the movie Rain Man."
"This sprawling cemetery dates back over 160 years, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2007. The unique layout, designed by Adolph Strauch, makes it feel less like a cemetery and more like a park that just happens to have people buried in it. The arboretum features many National Champion trees. To find the graves of the many famous people buried here, stop by the office on your way in for a free map."
"A millionaire's row from the 19th century rivaling the far more famous ones in New York City (5th Ave) and Chicago (Prairie Ave) giving one a glimpse of Cincinnati's heyday in the mid 1800s. This one is far more intact, but is part of an endangered neighborhood that's seen better days (its a bit seedy). The website discusses the history of the houses in the area, though the Hauck House is no longer a museum. An East Coaster would probably have their jaw hit the floor if they saw the low prices on these wonderful old mansions."
"Unique members only (however non members can browse but not check out books during business hours and its open to the public) old school private library complete with busts of famous literary figures, artwork, globes, dusty stacks of books and spiral staircases.

"Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral is a beautifully and ornate cathedral, a recommended sight for anyone traveling through Cincinnati. St. Peter in Chains Cathedral was the city's tallest structure when completed, as well as one of its most elegant buildings. Copying elements from classical Athenian buildings, architect Henry Walter produced one of the finest neoclassical Greek revival buildings in the United States with a look that is quite a bit more Byzantine than one would expect from a normal catholic church, well worth a look, particularly if you can get inside!"
"Built in 1841, this is the oldest standing church in Cincinnati and was for many years a center for the German-Catholics who called Over-The-Rhine home. For a taste of local culture, attend a mass in German on Sunday's see website for details"
"Like most old large cities in the US alleyways have old houses and buildings on them, Cincinnati is no exception, though not as many survived the onslaught of mid-late 20th century urban destruction as are in Philly or Boston. In one of these alleys is the oldest synagogue west of the Appalachian mountains, that was saved by being converted to condominiums in the early 2000s. This is a private residence, but should be something noted by travelers who happen to be next to ''Restaurant Row/The Aronoff Center''. The alley is well lit and fairly wide as its branded the ''Backstage District''."
"Originally St. Francis Xavier Seminary, the Athenaeum of Ohio is the third-oldest Roman Catholic seminary in the United States being established in 1829.

"The American Classical Music Hall of Fame includes a timeline through classical music (focusing on American classical music) and interactive displays of inductees. The Hall its located in is also worth a look too, as it was built as a memorial to those who perished in the Civil War, in the era close to the height of Cincinnati's prominence."
"The Cincinnati Art Museum is in the beautiful Eden Park, which perfectly reflects the artwork the museum houses. The museum has a 60,000 piece collection, which explains why the museum is referred to as the ''Art Palace of the West''. According to the Zagat Survey, The Cincinnati Art Museum ranks with The Art Institute of Chicago and The Museum of Modern Art in New York as the best art museums in the nation.

"CHHE has a heart-wrenching and inspiring exhibit called ''Mapping Our Tears'', which follows the stories of Cincinnatians involved in the resistance to Nazis and Holocaust survivors now living in Cincinnati. One part of the exhibit tells the tale of a local man, who after interrogating suspects to be tried at the Nuremberg Trials became U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg."

"The Cincinnati Zoo is the second oldest zoo in America and one of the most important worldwide because of its success with the mating of animals in captivity. The zoo is well worth a visit."
"The CAC is one of the regional leaders in thought-provoking art; the building itself is a piece of art with some of Cincinnati's boldest architecture. The center has also been the center of controversy; some may not see the ""''art''"" in some exhibits. If you do get this kind of art, hop one door north on Walnut to the ''21C Museum Hotel'' for a few more exhibits in its publicly open/free museum, for info on staying there see details under the '''Sleep''' section below."
"Harriet Beecher-Stowe is famous for writing the anti-slavery ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. Free (''donations are welcomed'')."

"Originally designed in 1855, replacing what was then a cemetery, this park has pretty much followed the fortunes of Over-The-Rhine, going from a prosperous hub of activity and immigration to a crime filled den of poverty and squalor. Fortunately along with the neighborhood, this park has undergone a major renovation, including interactive fountains designed to go with music selectable by phone app, a beergarden (this is Cincinnati), a large event lawn, playgrounds, and a look that combines a respect for the park's history with modern amenities. Its particularly striking to see at night when the fountains are lit up in different colors, and safety shouldn't be an issue then as there are plenty of security cameras installed to quell any potential issues with the neighborhood. 3CDC who remodeled Fountain Square led this renovation and as a result is programming it with plenty of events throughout the year, see website for details."

"For more than a decade, the Bengals were the punchline of a joke about the NFL. No more, though. Since the hiring of Head Coach Marvin Lewis, the Bengals have gone on to win the AFC North Division and have gained respect within the NFL. In his first season (2003), Lewis led the Bengals with an 8-8 record compared to the 2002 record of 2-14.

In the seventies, Cincinnati was home to a WHA team, in the Cincinnati Stingers, and an AHL team, in the Cincinnati Swords. Then came the Cyclones (1990-2004, 2006-present), and the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks (1997-2005). The Cincinnati Gardens was frequented by the likes of Barry Melrose, Don Biggs, Mark Messier and Wayne Gretzky on a pretty regular basis. Now, the second incarnation of the Cincinnati Cyclones play in the ECHL and are 2007-2008 ECHL champions. Crowds run 1,000-3,000 on a weeknight and 4,000-9,000 people on a weekend, far below the capacity of 12,000, so tickets should be easy to come by. However, crowds have grown significantly during the latter part of the 2007-2008 season. Game 1 of the Kelly Cup Championship game has the largest crowd in seven years to see an ECHL championship game, with 8,676 in attendance.

"Gift shop for American Legacy Tours, who run the 'Queen City Underground Tours', specializing in Cincinnati memorabilia."

"The department store that can be found all over the country. Their headquarters (NYC only has half the business since Cincinnati based Federated took this department store over) is only 2 blocks away."
"Bills itself as a Green General store, this quirky shop is good for everything fair trade and environmentally conscious, even some locally themed T-shirts too. It's a bit of an anchor to the revitalization of OTR and worth a look just for something quirky and a bit unexpected in Cincinnati."

"An excellent selection of rare Vinyl records as well as rare books and rare movies. Considered a bit of a hidden gem by locals."

"Owned by Raymond Gordo, former chef de cuisine for local celebrity and restaurateur Jean-Robert, Gordo's is renown for their semi-extensive beer list and delicious burgers."

"A great place to go for a quick cheap late night snack, though when the bars let out this place does get a bit too fratty."
"Founded in 1922 by two brothers from Greece. Empress is named after the burlesque theater that was originally located next door. It has been suggested that the Empress Chili concept was copied by other chili restaurants. Empress Chili consistently wins taste tests of Cincinnati's chili chains."
"The most famous chili chain, with numerous locations throughout the Cincinnati area and franchise locations in Columbus, Indianapolis, Louisville, and other smaller Midwest and Florida cities. Their chili is sold in supermarkets throughout the Midwestern United States in frozen packages or cans so that Cincinnati natives can enjoy it wherever they may be.

"Considered a contender for best Chili in the city by many. Its also a (mostly) 24 hour Diner, offering breakfast at all hours of the night. This is a good place to also try out Goetta, the lesser known German-Cincinnatian food similar to scrapple which you can't find anywhere outside of the region!"
"Price Hill Chili has been a landmark for the past 45 years, serving up Cincinnati favorites to West Side regulars. Cincinnati chili and stacked double-deckers are what Price Hill Chili is all about. This is a place politicians visit when in town for photo ops. The menu includes specialty dinners and salads. Another place to get the elusive Cincinnati only German sausage specialty Goetta."
"One of Cincinnati's major chili chains. While most Cincinnatians are loyal to Skyline, there are many who claim Gold Star is Cincinnati's best. For more locations, see Gold Star's store locator here [http://www.goldstarchili.com/locations/locations.asp?post=true]."

"Cincinnati's unusually hip take on the Belgian gastropub. Founded by a Belgian expat who was wanting to get the kinds of waffles he could get back home in Cincinnati, this place features delicious waffles of the Liège variety, and other Belgian styled goodies from bon bons to lambic beer. Try the locally inspired goetta crepes for something completely unique!"
"According to the restaurant, this was originally a speakeasy founded by George Remus (the bootlegger who inspired Jay Gatsby of ''The Great Gatsby'' fame) and was one of the first places in Ohio to apply for a liquor license when prohibition was repealed.

Crowd can be post-college frat boy with money on weekend nights, which could be minus or a plus depending on who you are, but the bar is gorgeous.

"A bar that has old school arcade cabinets and video game consoles, that attracts a hip crowd in a hip neighborhood.

Unfortunately, its also the more crowded of the two making weekend night trips kind of difficult."

There are more than hoppy beers available here (including some very good cider) but their emphasis is on IPAs and similar. Of note is that this is in the Old pre-prohibition Christian Moerlien Building which was at its peak one of the largest breweries in the United States, even exporting its beer overseas!

"is the arrival point for many visitors into Delhi. Once notoriously bad, the airport has been transformed into a thoroughly modern facility. There are several security checkpoints in the airport and you may have to show your boarding pass and passport a dozen times before boarding the plane. When leaving Delhi from the international terminal, you should show up 3 hours before your flight is scheduled. For domestic flights, 2 hours should be enough, depending on whether or not you must wait in the queues to check luggage. While sometimes time-consuming, the process is smooth, and the new terminal's shops and restaurants are sensibly located at the gate area, not before security. However, if you wish to change Rupees back into foreign currency, you must do this before clearing security."
"This is used only by low-cost carriers IndiGo, GoAIR and SpiceJet. (Oddly, their flights ''arrive'' at neighbouring Terminal 1C)"
"This enormous main terminal, is used by all international flights and all full-service domestic carriers including Jet Airways and Air India."

"(code ''DLI'').Huge and confusing."
"(code ''NDLS'') is located just outside of Paharganj, also known as the backpacker ghetto. - It will take about 40 min-1 hr to travel from the New Delhi Railway Station to the airport by car, depending on traffic, a taxi fare cost you about ₨ 400. - A tourist ticket office called the '''International Tourist Bureau''' is open during office hours upstairs of, but still within, the main New Delhi railway station (on the side away from the metro, near platform 1). Note that it is only for foreign tourists, so you ''must'' have a tourist visa (i.e. student and working visas are not acceptable). Non-resident Indians can also book their tickets through this office. Bring your passport and cash or traveller's cheques in Euros, British pounds or US dollars. If you wish to pay in Indian Rupees (₹) you theoretically ''must'' show an official exchange certificate (from India, not valid if you changed in another country) or an ATM receipt. All ticket bookings require exact change, as like everywhere in India the office has little to no change. If you don't have exact change, it's possible after booking to go down to the food stores, buy food to get change, then return and pick up your ticket. To get a ticket, first go to the centre of the room and get numbers for the reservation and information desks, as well as a form to fill out. Then line up at one of the two u-shaped lines of chairs, fill out the form, and prepare for a protracted wait. When your information number is called, have the clerk check the availability of the train(s) you desire and answer any questions you have about the form. Then wait for your reservation number to be called. Note that by the time you get to the reservation desk, your train may no longer be available, in which case you can try to reserve a different one. If you need a bathroom during this lengthy process, there is a relatively clean male and female toilet just outside on the verandah through the side door (the door you didn't enter through). - The station is large, crowded, confusing and packed with touts. Allow ''one hour'' to find your train the first time you visit. Don't trust the electronic display boards, which often show incorrect information. Instead listen to the announcements and ask multiple people in uniform (policemen) until you find your train."
"(code ''NZM''). Many trains heading south. It's the least chaotic of the ''Big Three'', but still pretty big and poorly signposted; listen to the announcements to figure out your train. The station has a pretty good food court that sells inexpensive, hygienic takeaway snacks including sandwiches and samosas."
"(code ''ANVT'') Repeatedly delayed, the station finally opened in December 2009 and will gradually take over all east-bound services."
"It often has waiting times not much longer than at the tourist booking office. You will need to know the number or name of the train you want to take."
"The Government of India Tourist Office offers daily tours, covering all of the major Delhi sites. If you should choose to go with the government-sanctioned day tour, be aware that due to the heavy agenda, you will need to have a quick foot, only 20-40 min are given for each sight, which is next to no time. Consider this day tour as a sampler. If there is a sight of particular interest, bookmark it and return at a later date."
"is one of Delhi's top tourist sights and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A brilliant red sandstone fort built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (who also built Agra's Taj Mahal) as his ruling palace. Completed in 1648, the years since have not treated the buildings kindly: the rooms have long since been stripped of all objects, the marble inlays are long gone and quite a few buildings are off limits. Still, the scale remains imposing and the gardens are kept lush and green even in midwinter."
"True to the name, this is a covered bazaar between the gate and the fort itself, now filled with souvenir hawkers."
"This building separates the outer court from the inner court, and has a marble platform for the emperor's throne."

"To the left after the Chatta Chowk, this is a reasonably well-presented museum on the history of independence activism in India, starting from the Mutiny of 1857 all the way to Gandhi."
"is one of Delhi's three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. - The tomb is in large, immaculately maintained gardens in the Persian ''Char Bagh'' (four corners) style that were thoroughly renovated in 2003 with the Aga Khan's help and are consequently probably the best in Delhi. As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal '''tomb of Iza Khan''', a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb. As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of the tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden. - The centrepiece is the eponymous '''tomb of Humayun''', the second Mughal emperor. Built starting in 1562, it was the first major Mughal structure in the city and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of Agra's Taj Mahal. The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around. You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun is buried. Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way. In the southeast corner is the '''Barber's Tomb''', also built in the same style. Historians do not know who is buried in this picturesque tomb made of red and grey sandstone."
"This complex , houses structures dating from the Slave Dynasty (1206-1290) and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The gardens are kept in excellent shape, making this a popular relaxation and picnic spot.

"Crafts fairs happen here every week. - It is a wonderful place to get crafts from all over the country. What is distinctive here is that the artists themselves come to sell their goods, so your money goes directly to them, rather than to middlemen. Some bargaining may be necessary if you want the best price. Prices are higher than elsewhere, but the modest entry fee keeps out beggars, ripoff artists, and most touts. Many visitors find the mellow atmosphere worth the extra cost of shopping here. It also has a section called Foods of India. This has a huge number of restaurants, each showcasing the food of a particular state of India. (Most of them give a mix of Chinese and Indian food, but state delicacies are also included).

The shopkeepers do more business than any proper branded shop, selling at least 5,000 books daily. There are also many whole sellers. Very few books will be on display and you need to ask for a particular type of book as the variety of books sold is huge.

Hurling is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the fastest field sport, with the ball (called a ''sliotar'') reaching speeds above 130 kph. Gaelic football can best be described as a combination of soccer and rugby. To keep the sports ""pure,"" it maintains an amateur status, with each parish in Ireland having a team — the inter-county games are generally extremely well-supported, so you may have difficulty getting tickets for the bigger matches. Tours of the '''[http://museum.gaa.ie/ GAA museum]''' and the stadium are also available, including a chance to try your hand at the sports themselves.

"This is a bizarre venue but what sets it aside from most other Dublin nights out is that if you want to hook up with singles desperate for a bit of ""how's your father"", this the place for you. Known in the fine Dublin phrase as a Meat Market this night out is crammed with people desperate to score and getting more and more willing as they consume more booze. A popular place with country people as opposed to Dubliners, this venue is dark and seedy and a perfect place to get up to shenanigans. However, bear in mind because of its reputation there is often up to three boys there for every girl at weekends. This venue is owned by a retired Garda and is frequented by serving members of the force so an altercation in the men's room is not advised as you may be in more trouble than you think; also consider this if you are liable to seduce someone's new friend. A night's decent accommodation and entry into the club start at about €5-10 per person depending on the day, also free before midnight weekdays and 23:00 at the weekend: even with these prices, the club still made over €16m in 2008."

Saturdays (free in before 23:00 and €10 after) are ""Saturgays & Beauty Spot Karaoke"", hosted by Veda and Davina Devine and offering patrons the chance to sing karaoke on stage and win two bottles of beer - the winner wins a whole case of beer. Sundays (free in before 22:00 and €5 after) are ""Bingo with Shirley Temple Bar"", offering various prizes and occasionally very high grand prizes. The remaining nights have DJs with current or classic hits. Arrive early if you want seats as the venue fills up quite quickly, especially on Karaoke and Bingo nights. There is also a more pub-like section to the side of the main club (known as 'Jurassic Park' by gay Dubliners, as a joke about its patrons) catering to an older clientele."
"Swords is the premier nightclub in North County Dublin if you are staying North of the canals a taxi ride will typically cost around €20 for up to 4 people (a bus sometimes also runs). It is best to find out if there is anything on before traveling as it is some distance from the city (about 10&nbsp;km), but by far, Wrights is the preferred venue of many Dublin clubbers, and has the largest capacity of any nightclub in Ireland."
"Leopardstown is the leading out of city Nightclub on the southside of Dublin. Been in business for over 15 years, Club 92 is where many of the young elite of South Dublin can be found socialising, although dress-code is strict and it is advised to call ahead to ensure entry is guaranteed.

"A public area that is often considered the central hub of Frankfurt's modern downtown area due to its importance as a public transportation station and its central location, right between the main shopping street (Zeil), the Rossmarkt (another public square), and the Eschenheimer Tor. The place is named after a Baroque building (""Hauptwache"") located more or less in its centre. The building was constructed in 1730 to house the local city militia, as Frankfurt was an independent city at the time.

"place where you can try ""Curry-Wurst"", which is a sliced beef sausage served with ketchup and curry spices, and considered one of the most popular German fast food products.

"This is a caffeteria-style self-service restaurant atop the Galeria Kaufhof department store at the Hauptwache. The food is unremarkable and average at best (even if prepared to order before your eyes), but the real reason to go there is the absolutely best view you can get of the Frankfurt's skyline and the Hauptwache from its 7th floor terrace. The Galeria Kaufhof is directly accessible from the Hauptwache U-Bahn/S-Bahn station, so you can pop in for a quick bite or just coffee and cake and enjoy the view."

"The former Sofitel started to age badly and rather than update it, Accor downgraded it to an MGallery. A taste of erstwhile luxury can be had at really reasonable rates outside of trade fair dates. You will, however, have to contend with worn furniture and fixtures and partially indifferent staff. The Savigny is at the border of a quiet residential lowrise district and the highrise quarter, so you can enjoy the best of both worlds - but not much in terms of views from your room."
"A typical example of the NH chain in Germany, with ''gemuetlich'' interior fixtures and subdued yet clashing colours that perhaps only Germans find appealing. Large windows with an openable section, good breakfast as always from NH and a location close to the old town."

"In a quiet square immediately south of the Hauptbahnhof, this hotel blends a historic 19th century building and a more modern 20th century one, and such a blend is to be found in the hotel's interior design too, done with the typical German charm. Despite charging arm and leg for almost all services, including WiFi, the hotel often finds its 300 rooms fully booked."

Tours of the building are available daily, and visitors can see the magnificent marble staircases, lobbies, see the debating chamber and the lavish banqueting hall. Tours take about 45 min. In front the building, '''George Square''', the city's notional centre, is populated by several statues of civic leaders and famous figures from history and is often used for outdoor events."
"This intersection marks the original medieval centre of the city and is dominated by the clock tower of the original City Chambers (destroyed by fire in 1926), and the small hexagonal building known as the Tolbooth. Just to the west on Trongate is the '''Tron Theatre''', a former church that was turned into a prominent theatre."
"The original subway station, a quaint overground building now used as a chain coffee shop, sits in the middle of St Enoch Square."
"The city's principal railway terminus, which is worth entering for its grand interior, which you can access from Gordon Street on the north side of the building. On the exterior, a feature of note is the massive glass walled bridge (known as the ''Hielanman's Umbrella'') which spans Argyle Street and holds up the tracks and platforms. You can go on a [https://www.glasgowcentraltours.co.uk/ tour of the station], which is highly recommended, but booking in advance is essential and places sell quickly. Don't be put off because you aren't interested in trains - the tour is mostly about the history and architecture of the station. The guides are really enthusiastic about railway history and have countless stories to share of the station's place in Glasgow's history: through the industrial revolution, through the war and to the present. You also get to visit an abandoned underground platform! The £13 entry fee goes into a pot earmarked for preserving the station's history and improving the tour."
"During the temperance movement, the idea of ""tearooms"", places where you could relax and enjoy non-alcoholic refreshments in differently themed rooms, became popular in Glasgow. This one, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1904, was the most popular of its time and has been lovingly restored. Make sure to have a look at the Room de Luxe on the second floor (access through the cafe on the first floor). You do not have to purchase anything if you just want to have a look around and ask nicely ."
"The Glasgow School of Art is Scotland's only independent art school offering university level programmes and research in architecture, fine art and design. If you want to create your own art, enrol for evening classes or the summer school. The original building on the campus was seen as one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's finest buildings, housing one of Britain's pre-eminent schools of art, design and architecture. In May 2014, the Mackintosh building was closed for the foreseeable future due to a major fire which damaged the west wing of the building (that had been added 1907-09), destroying the library. Efforts are ongoing to salvage damaged art works. Due to the closure the original building tour no longer takes place. However a new external tour ('''[http://www.gsa.ac.uk/visit-gsa/mackintosh-at-the-gsa-tour/ Mackintosh at the GSA Tour]''') is available and tells about Mackintosh's role at the Glasgow School of Art. The tour lasts 1 hour."
"One of Glasgow's best public buildings, it is the largest municipal public reference library in Europe. The imposing structure houses a spectacular reading room, although it has to be said much of the Mitchell's extensive collection is housed in the rather ugly 1970s extension attached to the rear. You can easily lose a day in here!"
"The bridge crosses the river west of the M8 motorway and is nicknamed the ""Squiggly Bridge"" by locals because of its distinctive S-shape."
"This bridge carries the M8 motorway across the Clyde. Built in 1969, the bridge is far more spectacular to stand beneath than drive over, with an almost cathedral-like vista and a strange aura of calmness that betrays the likely traffic chaos that is going unseen directly above your head."
"A relatively new and prominent bridge over the River Clyde that has an elegant curved design and is unique for how it crosses the river at an angle."
"Affectionately known by Glaswegians as the Armadillo, this building is a concert hall which forms part of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre complex. Designed by Lord Norman Foster, and contrary to popular belief, ''not'' inspired by the Sydney Opera House, it is in fact supposed to represent ship's hulls. The auditorium has now garnered some world fame for being the place where the Susan Boyle audition - one of the most downloaded YouTube video clips in history - was filmed."
"Founded as an institution in 1451, the University itself is the fourth oldest in the entire United Kingdom, and one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the country. Contains the '''Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery''' (see below), including a reconstruction of Mackintosh's house. The exterior of the main building is fine in its own right; the current main University building is neo-Gothic and dates from 1870, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (the man who also designed London's St Pancras railway station). The main building has an interesting visitor's centre (open all year round) which is free and sits atop a drumlin with commanding views over Kelvingrove Park and the western fringes of the city."
"An area of Georgian townhouses laid out in a radial pattern similar to the English city of Bath. This neighbourhood has made the transition from originally being an upmarket residential area to a prestigious office district for mainly legal and consultancy firms, although in recent years there have been moves to encourage the companies back into the city centre and return the buildings to residential use. If you make the effort to walk through Kelvingrove Park, go up to this area as it is worth descending down the grand '''Granite Staircase''', on the south side of the hill facing the river."
"Charles Rennie Mackintosh's last major building - thoughtfully designed, with an excellent museum covering both Mackintosh and the changing faces of schools."
"Built in the 1990s to Mackintosh's original 1901 entry for a design competition."

"The art gallery contains a world famous Whistler collection, and various temporary exhibitions. It also contains The Mackintosh House, a reconstruction of the principal interiors from the Glasgow home of the Scottish architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928). The separate museum is the oldest public museum in Scotland and has a variety of exhibits, including a display on the Romans in Scotland (featuring items found in the Roman Fort in Bearsden), one on the various dinosaur discoveries found on the Isle of Skye, and various temporary exhibitions."
"The city's grandest public museum, with one of the finest civic collections in Europe housed within this Glasgow Victorian landmark. The collection is quite varied, with artworks, biological displays and anthropological artifacts. The museum as a whole is well-geared towards children and families, with ""discovery center"" rooms of interactive exhibits and all the displays labeled with easy-to-understand descriptions. The ""Life"" wing holds fossils, wildlife displays, artifacts from ancient Egypt, exhibits on the Scottish people, a hall of arms and armor, and even a Submarine Spitfire hanging in the main hall of the wing. The ""Expression"" wing holds a fantastic collection of fine and decorative arts, including Salvador Dalí's celebrated ""Crucifixion of St. John of the Cross"" painting and select works by renowned artists like Van Gogh, Monet and Rembrandt, as well as a hall of period Glasgow furnishings by Mackintosh. The main hall has a functioning organ, and daily recitals are played in the afternoon."
"The People's Palace is a great folk museum, telling the history of Glasgow and its people, from various perspectives, displaying details of Glasgow life (including one of Billy Connolly's banana boots). The Winter Gardens, adjacent, is a pleasant greenhouse with a reasonable cafe."
"Glasgow's oldest remaining house, built in 1471, has been renovated to give visitors and idea what the inside of a Glasgow house was like circa 1700."
"Offers an excellent collection of vehicles and models to tell the story of transport by land and sea, with a unique Glasgow flavour. Besides the usual rail locomotives, buses, trams, cars and planes, the museum also includes a recreated subway station and a street scene of old Glasgow. The museum was designed by Zaha Hadid and completed in 2011."
"The ''Glenlee'' was built in 1896 and is one of only five Clydebuilt sailing ships that remain afloat in the world today, now restored and open to the public."
"A kinetic gallery / theatre. It consists of a number of strange machines created by the Russian artists Eduard Bersudsky. The machines perform stories and the light and sound during the performance adds to a really unique and amazing experience. The full show takes 1h10min, the short one 45min."
"This museum features exhibits relating not only to Glasgow's patron saint and the growth of Christianity in the city, but numerous exhibits pertaining to many faiths practised locally and worldwide."

"The most famous of the Glasgow parks, Glasgow Green was founded by Royal grant in 1450 and has slowly been enclosed by the city and evolved from grazing land into a modern public park. ""The Green"" as its known to the locals is one of the major venues for concerts and open air events in Glasgow. Among the highlights are the People's Palace and Winter Gardens (covered above), '''Nelson's Memorial''', an obelisk or needle: built to commemorate Nelson's victory at the battle of Trafalgar, the '''Templeton Carpet Factory''', with its ornate brick work (now a business centre), and the '''Doulton Fountain''', the largest terracotta fountain in the world. There is limited official parking in or around the green and the area is notorious for car crime. Be aware the council will tow away illegally parked vehicles and charge you up to £250 to get them back!"

"A great student institution known locally as ""Sleazy's"" it's a favourite among Glasgow School of Art students, it’s a cross between a bar and a nightclub, and even a coffee shop by day - one of Glasgow’s best established student venues. Live music in the evenings, and just across the road from the seminal Garage nightclub. Open until 03:00 every night of the week, with bands on practically every night also.

"Shows films, though it's primarily an art gallery. It's also a concert venue."
"The oldest surviving music hall in the world, having opened in 1857, in response to the entertainment needs of a growing working class population with pennies in their pockets. It most famously held the début performance of Stan Laurel (of silent movies, slapstick comedy duo Laurel and Hardy fame in 1906), but also hosted Jack Buchnanan and Sir Harry Lauder and a zoo! Acts needed some intestinal fortitude before they trod its boards, since Glasgow audiences were notorious for leaving no turn un-stoned - toilets only arrived in 1893 and young boys used to favour the front of the balcony because from there they could urinate on the heads of the performers on the apron! Electricity and moving pictures arrived in 1896 but by 1938, the Panopticon could no longer compete with more modern Cinemas and less vulgar Variety Theatres and was re-cycled into a tailors shop and factory. It now shows mainly music hall orientated shows: e.g. magic, burlesque and comedy, but also occasionally puts on classical and world music. There's no heating, so dress accordingly. No wheelchair/disabled access."

"Home of the Partick Thistle Football Club, also known as ""the Jags"" (and not actually in the suburb of Partick - the club is actually located in Maryhill). The stadium has a capacity of 10,887.

Established by the late great Ronnie Clydesdale - a local legend - this local restaurant has been serving up top quality food using Scottish produce since the early 1970s and is frequently lauded as one of Scotland's finest restaurants.

The result is Chardon D'Or, opened in 2001 and widely recognised as one of the very best quality restaurants in Glasgow. Owner Brian Maule is also well known for strong links with musicians and entertainers, and his restaurant often offers deals combining concerts or shows with fine dining for one fixed price.

"One of the best of the West End's Italian restaurants, but more upmarket than most."
"Stylish restaurant with excellent menu."

"Nicknamed the “Sarry Heid” by locals, this old school pub (began in 1755, although in a different building) lies at the gateway to the Barrowlands area and the East End. Like all pubs in the area it becomes an exclusive haunt of Celtic fans on match days, and gets very rowdy."

It witnessed much of the Hungarian history and recalls a number of national diets, peace treaties, a successfully beaten attack of the Tartars, domestic struggles of the Árpád dynasty, Turkish invasion, great fires and restorations. This fortress of Hungarian Benedictines, this illustrated ""picture book” of European art history from Romanesque to Classicism was undoubtedly worthy of being registered as World Heritage site by '''UNESCO'''. The crypt contains the oldest parts of the church. The first catalog of its invaluable library dates back to 1090 and today there are over 250,000 volumes in the library. The charter of the cloister from Stephen I dated 1001, and the earliest written record of the Hungarian language, the founder of the Tihany Abbey from 1055 are the most precious pride and joy of the archives. More details about opening times, entry fees, tours on foreign languages in the Transdanubia article."

"Infos, programs focused to the City."
"Originally called the '''H&ocirc;tel de Ville''' it's a striking cream and yellow French colonial building beautifully floodlit at night. No entry, but the statue of '''Uncle Ho''' in front is a very popular place for photos."
"The museum, housed in a French colonial-era building, relates the life of the modern day father of Vietnam. The exhibits include various personal possessions of Ho Chi Minh, but are mainly photographs. It's not overly informative, the interior is shabby and the staff are disinterested. Whilst some may find the theme a little jingoistic, like most things it depends upon your point of view. The onsite shop stocks the usual souvenirs along with some books related to Ho Chi Minh."
"The museum has a fine collection of Vietnamese antiquities. Read up on Vietnamese history first or you'll have no idea what you're looking at. Outside, the Botanical Gardens are very nice and a good place for a cheap lunch away from the crowds."
"This is a restored 4 floor time warp to the 1960s left largely untouched from the day Saigon fell to the North; construction started in 1962 and finished in 1966. Formerly South Vietnam's presidential palace, the war ended on 30 Apr 1975 when Tank 843 crashed through the gate. A replica of that tank is now parked on the lawn outside. Be sure to check out the impressively kitschy recreation room, featuring a circular sofa, and the eerie basement, full of vintage 1960s phones, radios and office equipment, supposedly left exactly as it was found when the North took over. There is also a photo gallery and a propaganda film recounting how the South Vietnamese supporters and American imperialists succumbed to Ho Chi Minh's indomitable revolutionary forces, at which point the South Vietnamese supporters were forgiven and everyone lived happily ever after. Tours are available and are free, but not necessary. There is a nice outdoor café on the grounds outside the palace."
"The museum was opened in a hurry, less than five months after the fall of the South Vietnamese regime. It has moved to new premises with 3 storeys of exhibits and various US military hardware (tanks, jets, helicopters, howitzers) on display outside the building. This disturbing display of man's cruelty during the Vietnam (American) War includes halls full of gruesome photographs, a simulated ""tiger cage"" prison and jars of deformed foetuses attributed to contamination by Agent Orange. An exhibit on the 3rd floor tells the story of the war journalists from all over the world who documented, and often disappeared or died in the war. Watch out for the amputees who will try and sell you their wares. It's a short walk from Reunification Palace &mdash; see the museum pamphlet for a map."
"An opera house built by the French during the colonial period, and without a doubt one of the finest performance venues in Southeast Asia. In modern times it is home to the critically acclaimed AO show, an acrobatic show that fuses Vietnamese traditions with modern Cirque Nouveau performances. Occasionally hosts classical music performances when the AO show is not being performed."
"The temple is near the Cu Chi Tunnels where Vietnamese soldiers held out during the Vietnamese/US war. Tours of the Cu Chi Tunnels can also be arranged."
"One of 12 mosques in Ho Chi Minh City, the Central Mosque was built in 1935. It was originally constructed for worshipers from southern India then resident in Saigon, but now Muslims from as far as Pakistan and Indonesia come to pray. Friday has the biggest congregations. The shaded veranda and cool stone floors make it an ideal place to sit, read, or even nap in the heat of the day. As with most mosques, remember to take your shoes off before entering and dress conservatively if you wish to enter."
"A French-built Catholic cathedral in the city centre."
"Dedicated to the god of happiness and virtue. The pagoda itself is dusty and dwarfed by high-rises under construction nearby, but the small, sculpted grounds are a good place for a rest from the hectic city."
"The oldest pagoda in town, home of a lot of incense and a cheerful puppy."
"Dedicated to Lady Thien Hau, the sea goddess, who left two giant turtles to keep an eye on things in her absence. A festival is held in her honour on the 23rd day of the March lunar month. Don't miss the gorgeous sculptures in the walls of the courtyard outside the temple."
"Inside is a viewing platform with a 360° panorama of the city. Alto Heli Bar happy hour 13:00 to 19:00. 2 4 1 selected cocktails 290,000 dong and 3 for 2 Tiger draught beer 135,000 dong."
"This is one of the newest and largest tourist attractions in Vietnam. It features the Dai Nam Van Hien Temple, an entertainment site, open range zoo, shopping areas, hotels, local and Western cuisine, and the largest man-made mountain range in Vietnam. Costing over 50 billion dong to build, this park is the beginning of mass tourism in Vietnam, although it is aimed at both tourists and locals and comes highly recommended. Transport options to the park are quite convoluted and as the park is new, online information is scarce. According to the locals, it is very much worth a visit, purely just to view the temple."
"Close to the city centre. This water park offers some unique water slide experiences, including the amazing ""Space Bowl"". Restaurant, health services and animatronic dinosaurs are on the premises."
"Considered by many to be Saigon’s finest pagoda. Check out the room filled with unusual figurines, to the left of the main hall. There are many turtles in a concrete pond in the courtyard."
"A favourite among locals."
"Despite the name, legitimate foot and body massage, hostess will explain pricing to you at the beginning, usually offering 30% discount."
"2 locations in HCMC and the first to offer 3D movies (at Hung Vuong Plaza only)."
"VIP speedboat tours to the Cu Chi Tunnels, the Mekong Delta and jungle canal tours around Saigon. A sunset tour around Saigon involves exploring narrow jungle canals with a village made of bamboo and thatch as well as visiting a floating temple."
"Running along Phan Ngu Lao St are a number of parks which fill up with locals before sunset, after work. They play a variety of games which you can participate in: badminton, kicking a shuttlecock and womens group aerobics to music are all very popular, and are great to watch. If you sit down by yourself in the open area near the Ben Thanh market a number of young university age locals will come and ask to practice English with you, this is a great way to spend an evening and the best way to meet intelligent interesting youth, they will question you either individually or in groups and share with you a lot about their country. Beware of those men who want to introduce you to their ""sister"" who's working as a nurse and wants to move to your country. They will try to make you come into their home so you can reassure their parents, but will actually gamble and cheat at cards with you and/or ask you for money after telling a sad and fake story about some dying relative."
"Explore the city catching local buses."
"The school offers one-on-one study,focus on intensive classes to get fluent in Vietnamese in a short time, or 1-2 weeks classes for tourist & homes stay to experience the local lifestyle"
"Private school with comprehensive courses from beginner to advanced composition. Students can take private courses or join group classes."
"In District 1, the University of Social Sciences has comprehensive university-style courses in Vietnamese, group classes typically 6-10 people."
"A serious contemporary art gallery located in District 1. Unlike the galleries that focus on more decorative works, this gallery represents innovative local and international artists including Tiffany Chung, Do Hoang Tuong, Hoang Duong Cam and Sandrine Llouquet."
"There are several shops along this street selling oil paintings. If you want a portrait of a Vietnamese painting or even have your own photograph oil-painted, shop around here. You can get a readily available portrait within a day or two."
"Vietnamese contemporary original art works including oil paintings, lacquer paintings, water colours and sculpture."
"Lots of lacquerware."

"Headphone and earphone shop selling genuine products."
"A den of thieves, but some great shopping. Ben Thanh is recognizable from its clock tower on the large roundabout. The largest old-style market in the central district, with several hundred small stalls stuffed with goods on almost impassably narrow aisles. Due to its popularity with tourists, the market is now divided between tourist goods (jeans, T-shirts, smaller souvenirs in abundance) and regular items (fruit and vegetables, rice, kitchen wares, flowers, meat, fast food and local-style pickled fruits). Most items are not price-marked, and vendors always quote a 50-100% higher price to tourists, so bargaining hard will save you money. The chief method of parting visitors from their money is ambiguity: for example, never making it quite clear how much you are being quoted or what the exact price is or what exchange rate is being used to calculate your change. Be ready for these ruses (often by a sweet, smiling young lady), or be prepared to part with more cash than you need to. Right at the north side (back) of Ben Thanh Market are some shops that are operated by Ben Thanh Group and they sell goods at fixed price and much cheaper than the stalls in the market. No bargaining needed. If the good selection of knock-offs here just won't do, there's plenty to be had in the surrounding side street shops or night market later. If retail warfare isn't your cup of tea, you could skip the touristy Ben Thanh altogether and go to '''Chợ Bình Tây'''."
"The underrated twin of Ben Thanh, selling everything from spices, Chinese medicines, and silk to obscure varieties of fermented fish, dried seafood, and jerky. If you are searching for a variety of Vietnam silks and velvets, skip the tourist trap Ben Thanh Market and go to Bình Tây instead. Most of Chợ Bình Tây is wholesale goods. Much of Ben Thanh Market's goods are from here."
"Here you can enjoy many kinds of different foods and drink and do your shopping as well."
"A good place for a visit. It is a twin of Ben Thanh but with air conditioning. Haggling your way through this place is the rule of thumb. Local middle-class Vietnamese shop here on the weekends too. Consider planning your shopping here during the day and go to Ben Thanh for the night market. The daytime Ben Thanh can be planned as a sightseeing trip instead of a shopping spree."
"Sometimes called the '''American Market''' or ""Cho Cu"" or ""Khu Dan Sinh"". Hidden behind rows of hardware and electric supplies shops, just brace yourself and enter. Dense warrens of stalls include those selling old American military gear of indeterminate authenticity (e.g., ""nice collection of so-called authentic GI's Zippo lighter from the war era""), cheap T-shirts and military paraphernalia: just don't hope to find a genuine US wartime Zippo, they're all fakes now. Despite the name, most stalls now specialise in various industrial-type products such as hand tools and personal safety equipment."
"Frequented by the Saigon middle-class and backpackers alike, can be found everywhere around HCMC. Prices are reasonably lower, though the selection leans more toward Vietnamese foods."
"Now known as Saigon Square. Formerly the Russian Market, this is now a rather sterile department store of sorts filled with stalls selling touristy kitsch, although the selections get better as you ascend the levels. There's a good supermarket on level 2. If you are traveling here by taxi, the new name may be met by blank expressions from taxi drivers. The old name seems to work."
"A recently opened McDonalds in the backpacker area in District 1."
"Fresh sandwiches, especially the traditional Vietnamese ""Banh Mi"". Bread is baked fresh in the store. There are 3 other outlets around the city."
"Rice and hamburgers. The combo meals are good value."
"5-item menu available all day for 25,000 dong (vegetarian) or 50,000 dong with chicken."
"Huge portions. USD1 for a big tiger, USD2 for a chicken curry with rice which is so large you won't finish. This is a very inconspicuous place, but most of the customers are regular expats. The food is nothing special but the prices, portions, and drink options make it a good bet. Good fruit salad, lovely smoothies and great tom yam soup."
"This is a shop that sells Hue food including Hue beef noodles and traditional ''banh beo'' rice cakes."
"Ice cream in a quirky and cool neon atmosphere, with lots of white leather seating. Free unlimited (unsweetened) iced tea served with your ice cream."
"Vietnamese and Western food with good selection of pasta, sandwiches, burgers and enchiladas."
"The famous Lunch Lady was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show. Different noodle dish every day."
"Special decor with small musical instruments, traditional dress and hats from the many ethnic groups of northern Vietnam. Vietnamese food such as spring rolls, hot pot & pho. They have a live Vietnamese instrument show on every Friday and Sunday."
"A nice cheap place for soup. Try the ''sate'' version of the usual pho or my, a spicy delicacy."
"A small space and very cheap place for pho and bo kho."
"Their specialty is pho. Locals come regularly and lucky backpackers stumble upon it. It is air-conditioned on the second and third floors. They also have decent banh mi bo kho, which is beef stew with carrots, served with French baguette."
"Clean modern chain found everywhere in Ho Chi Minh City. Excellent beef noodle soup, very cheap. Watch out for the fake Pho 24/24 on Pham Ngu Lao St, which does not belong to the chain and serves terrible and expensive food."
"The restaurant was once visited by a former US president, Bill Clinton. Has pho, including a seafood version, along with the usual Vietnamese rice dishes, as well as a superb vegetarian curry."
"Well-presented vegetarian food."
"Local food including excellent crab served in a friendly atmosphere."
"A barbecue restaurant offering both Vietnamese and international foods."
"Extensive menu with a choice between Vietnamese, Italian, Mexican and other styles. Open plan kitchen so you can see your food being prepared."
"Fresh and juicy beef patty."
"A nice range of Mediterranean food, Vietnamese breakfast and a prix fixe lunch menu. Hosts a monthly art exhibition"
"Spread over 2 floors, serving modern and traditional Vietnamese cuisine. Dishes include northern Vietnamese recipes of the owner/chef Thuy Linh, who is also an accomplished singer in a famous band, 5DK. Local singers, actors, celebrities and foreigners flock to this bistro both for its unique take on modern and classic Vietnamese food, and its ambience."
"Tasty Vietnamese vegetarian food although with surly service. Be careful of being charged for unexpected items, such as the disposable hand towels that are presented to you without asking as you sit down."
"Restaurant downstairs, on the second floor is a comfortable bar with pool table. International food and local dishes. Fresh fruit shakes, spring rolls, Vietnamese noodles and pasta."
"A modest, open-air restaurant serving mostly southern country-style food. The name literally means ""scent of the fields"". It's a place where families and groups of friends gather, drink a lot of beer, eat a lot of food, and make a bit of noise. You might need a few beers to get up the courage to try some of the more exotic offerings, including field mouse, whole frog, pigeon porridge and coconut worm. A whole char-grilled ga ta (local style free-range chicken) is 170,000 dong, head and feet included. A wide variety of other meats and seafood is available for 50,000-80,000 dong. Quirky English translations of the long menu add to the spirit of adventure."
"Authentic French boulangerie, patisserie and salon de thé. French petit dejeuner at 50,000 dong, with egg/bacon 100,000 dong."
"A very touristy Vietnamese restaurant. Daily business lunch USD3+ and weekly special dishes. Expanded to a twin outlet on 14th floor of Palace Hotel Saigon, 10 min away from the first outlet. Same menu, same price."
"The biggest chain of Singaporean restaurants in Vietnam, all ingredients imported. 100% Singaporean food with a head chef and owner from Singapore."
"A restaurant specialising in seafood. Fish salad and clams cooked in white wine."
"Small place specializing in northern-style Vietnamese cuisine. Run by an chef/owner who has 25 years of experience with Sofitel hotels. Cooking and presentation is top notch. Clean and nicely decorated."
"Two different restaurants operate with the same name within a few blocks of each other, one at 160 Pasteur Street, and the other (recently reopened) on Nam Ky Khoi Nghia across from the Reunification Palace. Set in atmospheric old French villas, with similar menus Vietnamese food, including regional specialities prepared in numerous independently-operated food stalls around the perimeter. Both are popular and both tend to be jammed at peak hours requiring a wait for a table. (The name literally means ""restaurant of delicious eating"".) The one on Pasteur has dozens of kerosene lamps burning for ambience at night, so if you have asthma or pulmonary issues or feel you've had enough pollution already, better to try the other one."
"A delicious, reasonably-priced open-air barbecue restaurant on the roof above Fanny's ice cream parlour and the Temple Club. Every table has a grill in the centre and the menu includes a variety of meats and seafood which you can grill yourself. Try the bacon wrapped salmon & the beef wrapped cheese skewers. They also serve a variety of mostly southern-style salads and noodle dishes. It's very popular and often fills up by mid-evening."
"Clean, medium-priced restaurant serving food from the regions of Hue, Saigon and Hanoi. Friendly service, full air-con, 2 floors and room for about 100 persons."
"Largest and most-visited Thai restaurant in HCMC. Mostly local Vietnamese and expats as it is out of the tourist area. Authentic Thai food prepared by the two Thai chefs. Food is fresh and served within minutes. Tom yam gung and papaya salad, spicey shrimp, fusion of Thai with other cuisines. Seating over 200, in air-con, al fresco or Thai style on floor mats. Delivery available to all districts. Top floor BBQ."
"Probably the best sushi value in Saigon. They serve a larger and more interesting variety than the typical sushi restaurant, at half the price. Draft Tiger beer is 24,000 dong. Very popular, so you can expect to wait during the middle dining hours."
"A growing chain. Wrapped Vietnamese fusion food in a modern minimalist setting. Try the desserts."
"Just to prove that Saigon has everything, here is a Brazilian-style churrascaria (all-you-can-eat restaurant featuring barbecued meat), with live Latin music Tuesday to Saturday. They also have a new outlet in Sky Garden II, Phu My Hung, District 7. It's a larger and less crowded one with usually better service."
"Nice Vietnamese and Asian-fusion food in a villa setting, with indoor and garden seating. Popular for business groups. Prices higher than average for Saigon, but a better value than you will find in the tourist section of town."
"The only posh restaurant on the banks of the river. Modern fusion cuisine using the local ingredients."
"Outstanding Spanish and Cuban-style food, including a large tapas menu. Also one of the few places in Vietnam that makes really good cocktails."
"An Italian restaurant with excellent home-made pasta dishes in the range of 125,000 dong and main dishes 150,000+."
"Chinese cuisine including Peking Duck and dim sum. Large with an ancient China theme."
"Decent small Italian restaurant. Delicious lasagna is their specialty; the pizzas are a bit oily. Dinner of 2 starters, cocktails, 0.5 litre carafe of wine, mains and deserts for roughly USD50, but with poor service."
"The ground floor is open-air, the upper floor has air-con. Rather expensive and mediocre food, around USD10/person but they will park your motorcycle while you eat, and wander around the waterfront."
"1930s ambiance with separate bar, restaurant, and lounge area sections. The food is fair but most people come to soak up the atmosphere."
"Excellent French restaurant in an area not normally associated with high dining. Great for a leisurely dining experience."
"Eclectic crowd comprised of local Vietnamese, local expats, and visiting tourists. Wine-by-glass and cocktail menu. At night the lighted columns create a great ambience."
"A welcome addition to the HCMC culinary scene, serving delicious American and International cuisine. The two level building has a modern industrial design element that makes you feel like you aren't in Vietnam. At night, the restaurant takes on a bar like atmosphere and their bartenders serve up some great cocktails from the amber lit rock bar. On Friday and Saturday nights, they also have DJ's spinning hip hop. Brunch favorites are served on Saturday and Sunday from 10am."
"Malaysian owned, authentic Malaysian cuisine and Vietnamese menu."
"Vietnamese and Malaysian cuisine."
"Vietnamese, Malaysian, and vegetarian cuisine prepared to halal guidelines. Has a Malaysian owner and there are several Malaysian staples on the menu, however it is primarily Vietnamese, with a wide range of dishes from around the country."
"Certified halal, serves halal food on 2nd floor."
"Turkish place with good service serving real doner kebabs, halal style."
"Malaysian cuisine and Vietnamese food."
"Nice place with good beverages. Used to show movies on 2nd and 3rd floor. Now reopened as La Cantina."
"Plays loud techno music. Attractive, but pretentious crowd."
"The decor is Roman ruins-lite (they meant ""Napoli""), but the menu is typical for an upscale Vietnamese cafe: coffee, fruit drinks, ice cream, and a simple menu including eggs and rice dishes. Piped music is nice, not too loud by day (though louder at night), prices are decent. Outdoor terrace in the front, air-con section on the ground floor, and evening lounge-bar on the upper floor. Next door to the louder, more trendy and possibly pretentious Cafe Nam Sao."
"Italian coffee, foods, free Wi-Fi, relaxing & modern music."
"This place has a really authentic and wonderful cafe sua da served by the famous ""grandma"" for about 8,000 dong. A little tricky to find."
"Reasonable prices, good menu. Free Wi-Fi."
"Save the world from pint size caramel lattes. Brave the decrepit stairway and enter an oasis."
"Free Wi-Fi, play hill song music."
"In the French tradition, with fresh pastries, collared waiters and elaborate portions of ice cream. Well-located, but over 20,000 dong for the simplest cup."
"As its name implies, this place is hidden away and a good place to read, or have a quiet conversation or meal. Decent Western menu, although slightly pricey."
"A rather hard to find coffee shop. Upstairs is like a bedroom with a couple of beds. Arrive early if you want to occupy one. It has large selection of magazine and comic books to chose from. Only serves Vietnamese drinks, and the staff only speak a little English. Free Wi-Fi."
"Reminiscent of HCMC in the past. It has a great view to Dong Khoi St. All the drinks and foods are typical Saigon. The staff are quite decent."
"Modern lounge café where the specialty is fruit-topped natural frozen yogurt. The only café in HCMC that serves this refreshing healthy treat. Creative fruit smoothies and light Vietnamese and Western fare. Flat-screen TVs, and English-speaking staff."
"Vietnamese coffee or cappuccini. They have a skilled Japanese espresso master who knows how to brew coffee. French mixed with Asian design with brick walls. It is marketed towards tourists and all proceeds go to the church around the corner."
"All proceeds benefit needy Vietnamese families. Good drinks, friendly staff, but their cookies could be better if they were baked in a real oven."
"The Vietnamese version of Starbucks, but with much better coffee. They have locations all over the city, but are not well represented in the heart of the tourist district. Figure on 10,000 dong for a basic cuppa, although there are plenty of variations including the infamous '''weasel coffee''' (cà phê chồn), made from coffee beans collected from civet excrement; however, a quick Google search about the conditions in which the civets are kept may further dissuade some from sampling."
"This is the scene for Vietnam's fashion slaves and seems to be the place to be seen. Pretentious atmosphere (it's not the best for those who want to relax), but their coffee is very good and their menu is quite satisfying. The place is always packed."
"Rooftop bar at AB Tower in District 1 along September 23 park. This is the place to see and to be seen. drinks are expensive at 200,000+ If you are around the September 23 park at night you will see the lights and hear the music blasting from the top of the AB tower. Look for the spotlights shooting into the sky."
"Though only 1 km from the heavily touristed centre, this club is completely outside the tourist orbit, and offers an interesting view of local life. The all-Vietnamese house band performs every night, mostly American music, and it's always jammed with student-aged groupies. For some reason, they address the crowd in English between songs, even though half the crowd doesn't understand. On weekends, at least, you need to arrive by 19:30 to have any hope of getting a seat. If your hobby is rock ballad or hard rock, you should go on Friday night."
"Park View. Pool table, darts, friendly staff, beautiful people, loads of food. Stays open late depending on the crowd. Worth a trip from Q1 to experience the true expat scene."
"The house band has changed some personnel but is still good, specializing in flamenco, salsa and Latin pop, and with an eclectic mix of other popular songs thrown in. Cocktails 110,000 dong, shots 80-85,000 dong, but with no entrance charge. It's popular and fills up on weekends."
"Centrally located English pub, complete with darts board and warm beer. Friendly, but shuts at midnight."
"Large cabaret featuring some of the biggest Vietnamese celebrity singers in Vietnam. The headliner is often familiar to the locals from television. Most overseas visitors may not like the musical style as it is mostly the mellow-to-melancholy, soft-jazzy, love-ballady style favoured by the middle and older generation of Vietnamese. But it's pure Vietnam, and very popular with both HCMC residents and Vietnamese expats on trips home."
"Brewery, restaurant offering German food, with tasty beers and cocktails. The outside terrace is a nice place to chill out, and the inside restaurant is very welcoming with its two beer tanks and cosy bar."
"A nightclub in the Western style, with loud music and minimalist too-cool decor. Drink prices on par with most Saigon nightclubs. Mixed crowd (Vietnamese, tourists and expats), pretty good food but has a small dance floor. Ladies night on Tuesday offers free drinks for ladies until midnight. Be sure to arrive early as it gets very busy from around 22:30 and it is difficult to get served at the bar."
"House band plays covers of Metallica, Guns 'n Roses and other popular rock bands nightly between 21:00 and midnight."
"Great place to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Friendly staff, Asian food. Quite low key in comparison to other PMH bars."
"Mixture of expats and locals, starts getting busy quite early. Music from the 1980s to the present. Noisy and smokey."
"Established in 1992 under the Opera House. Mix of locals, tourists and expats in a grotto-like uber-chic setting that could as easily be in Soho as Saigon. Open till late every night. Great cocktails, though at very high prices, similar to the roof-top bar of the Caravelle Hotel across the street. It's the cool place to be seen if you have a lot of Uncle Hos in your pocket. Terrace and Indoor areas. DJ nights."
"A Brazilian flowery decor-themed bar/pub with a Filipino house band playing pop/rock such as Bon Jovi and Skid Row."
"This little hole in the wall is only a stone's throw from Allez Boo, but much more expat orientated. Open until late."
"Two open-air cafe-bars with live music in villa-style settings, which attract few if any tourists but typify what most Vietnamese consider a pleasant evening out. Both feature a mix of classical chamber music, Vietnamese lounge songs, American FM classics and the odd French song."
"Western food with fish 'n' chips and burgers."
"Nice ambiance & music. Latest chic bar in town. Gets very busy, and at weekends you will need a booking."
"Great wine list. Nice ambiance & service."
"Very cosy atmosphere, with sofas lining the walls and beautiful decor. Good food & drinks selection, nice music, and a mix of both locals & expats. Friendly staff, and the management's always there to make you feel welcome and make sure you get what you are asking for."
"For those who have been here before, you'll find the original bar is now Highlands Coffee and an all new Allez Boo has opened on the opposite corner. It's shiny and brand-new, but retains the same feel as the original. There's a bar with air-con on the 2nd floor with DJ-type music, and an airy rooftop patio. Quite similar to its sibling establishment, Go2 Bar."
"Legendary and still packed on weekends, although aside from a few movie references it's not all that much to look at. Stays open late. Now opened their 2nd floor for DJ, dancing, drinks with less crowded atmosphere."
"All-in-one place with a massage parlour, disco, KTV, and a mini-casino. Price is on the expensive side, but it is a sight to behold."
"The main backpacker bar while Allez Boo was closed, still a great meeting place. It's impossible to miss the four floors of neon lights on the outside. Large patio on the sidewalk at street level, a cosier bar on the second floor with occasional live music or big-screen sports, plus a rooftop patio (with retractable roof) with individual BBQs up a steep set of stairs on the 5th floor. Crawling with prostitutes after dark until sun up."
"Late night venue with lots of character, claims to be Saigon's premier music bar and it's hard to argue, assuming, that is, you have a taste for non-chart buzzy British guitar and obscure dark US/European stuff. You have to ask for happy pop, though if you're spending enough it'll sometimes get an outing. Like most Saigon bars, it attracts its share of working girls. If you're not interested, simply say you're not and you'll be left alone."
"Two doors down from the Duna Hotel. Thumping music until 02:00 with friendly staff. Sex workers catering to Western men here. If you're not interested, just gently let it be known."
"Always busy after 18:00, famous for its strong drinks, daily dollar-specials (e.g., Tuesday USD1 for vodka mixers all night) and friendly staff. It has the same owner as Le Pub in Hanoi. The Pub Quiz (almost every Tuesday) is very popular with expats, especially the English teachers. Get there early or it's too packed to find a place to sit down. Indoors and outdoor tables available."
"They serve a buffet dinner at the dinner hour, which gradually gives way to drinks and music. Acts change over time, but recently included a Filipino band playing FM classics and a Vietnamese group playing Latin and flamenco. It's a pleasant place to get above the city noise and enjoy some fresh air. Cocktails around 140,000 dong."
"A pleasant, breezy bar with a great view of the city. Great live band (Cuban) playing inside every night. Cool, quiet ambience on the terrace. Attracts an expense-account crowd due to the prices."
"American Wild West-themed bar, live music every night and other entertainment. Drinks are expensive."
"Small, cosy Irish-themed bar with imported draft beer and live music. Brits will appreciate the great food tasting of home (or the closest you'll get here)."
"Live music on some nights of the week and a typical bar atmosphere for both tourists and expats. Drinks from 50,000 dong, including sales tax, tip not necessary."
"Professional billiards tables and a spacious lounge. Food and drinks and you can customise the billiard table lights from a special lighting system."
"Casual-upscale, the clients tend to come for the great choice of wines-by-the-glass (huge walk-in wine cellar), or for the cocktails (premium brands) and good selection of imported beers. Can remain open after midnight, depending on the number of customers."
"A friendly family-run guesthouse, very clean and homely. Free Internet, cheap laundry and all rooms have double glazing."
"Amazing small hotel in an alley off Pham Ngu Lao. They can arrange an airport pickup for USD15, although an official taxi from the airport counter will cost USD8. Some staff members speak English and the service is good."
"Comfortable rooms with air-con, fan, free Internet and breakfast. Friendly staff."
"Very friendly owners. Rooms with air-con, refrigerator, cable TV, en suite bath, and Wi-Fi. Very reasonably priced minibar."
"All rooms have air-con, satellite TV, a fridge, elevator. Pleasant staff. The front door is locked around 23:00-24:00."
"Vietnamese styling, with bamboo interiors, rattan beds and wooden floors."

"Family-run guest house with friendly staff who speak English. Air-con, hot water, cable TV with international channels, baggage storage, laundry service, big beds. with balconies."
"Family-run guest house in a small, safe, quiet alley. Some English is spoken. Rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. With air-con, hot water, big beds and some with balconies. Free Internet and Wi-Fi. Warning: two yapping small dogs."
"Friendly family. Tucked in a side alley from Pham Ngu Lao or Bui Viên next to My Home Guest Home. Small balcony. Clean apartments with aircon and wifi. 15000 or 30000 VND per kg for 24h or express laundry."
"Friendly staff and clean. The buses from up north drop you right near this hostel. Air-con, hot water, comfortable beds, free Wi-Fi. Free bananas at all times and they do laundry. Tourist bars and clubs are a couple hundred metres away."
"Nice and very clean."
"Friendly German and English speaking staff. Air-con rooms with private baths, hot water, Wi-Fi, cable TV with international channels. Baggage storage and laundry service. Travel desk can arrange flights and bookings."
"Clean hotel with friendly staff, free Internet and Wi-Fi. Elevator. 5 storeys, garden on top floor and free breakfast."

"Run by a friendly Englishman, offers clean dorms and rooms, can book tours and offers a big breakfast for USD1."
"Large, bright albeit somewhat worn rooms, and those at the front have a nice view."

"Air-con, refrigerator, cable TV and private bath with hot shower and free Internet. Online bookings. Good service."
"Christina's Saigon is an amazing flashpacker slash guesthouse slash bed and breakfast concept run by Thu and his team. The studios are beautifully designed with modern bathrooms so clean that they would put most hotels, even the higher end ones, to shame. Booking is exclusively available through Airbnb. If you're lucky enough to get a place, you'll have a different impression on Vietnam altogether...and that's not an exaggeration."
"Every room has air-con, cable TV, and Internet."
"Lovely modern, clean hotel. Rooms come with LCD flat screen TVs, and wall-mounted air conditioning controls. The suite has a spa bath. Free Wi-Fi and friendly staff."

"All rooms and suites have air-con, TV with satellite channels, IDD telephone, coffee/tea maker and minibar. Bar, cafe, spa and massage services, business centre, gym and high speed Internet access. Annoyingly, housekeeping have a tendency to knock on bedroom doors early in the morning, but then don't make up the rooms until early afternoon."

"To get a visa or modify one, you may be able to get it done, or may have to ask a travel agent. Typical cost for a visa extension of one month is USD10, 5 working days delay (they keep the passport). You need to fill form N14/M with your details and the one of your sponsor, either a hotel or private house and get a stamp from the police station corresponding to its location. This point could be tricky as it implies that you have register at the police station before. If not, expect extra delay (5 or more days, for example) or cost. Quick processing (2 days) is possible, but you need to justify it. Going through travel agents costs about USD30, but they manage the police stamp whatever your situation is (extra fee of USD20 for quick processing). Other prices: single entry visa USD25, multiple-entry USD50-100, change single-entry visa to multiple-entry for 6 months USD25-75, modification/extension of visa USD10. As of April 2015 this office will tell you that you must use an agent if you wish to extend a tourist visa."

"Literally ""Four minarets"" (Char means four and Minar means minarets). Quli Qutb Shah built the Charminar in 1591 at the very spot at which he prayed for the end to the plague epidemic. The Charminar, made of pulverized marble, limestone, mortar and granite, has long been the icon of Hyderabad. The towers rise to a height of 48.7 m above the ground. It has 140 steps. Graffiti on the walls have diminished the beauty of the Charminar. There is a mosque with 45 prayer spaces located inside in the upper storeys. The structure stands in the middle of a busy road with vehicular traffic, but a pedestrianization project is under way. Atop the minarets, you get a panoramic view of Hyderabad city; to reach the top of the monument, there are 149 winding steps to the upper floor. At the very bottom of one of the minar, there is a Hindu temple. The traffic is terrible. Plan an early morning trip around 9AM if shopping is not on the to do list. There is a separate entry way for foreigners. If taking trains, you can take an auto (₹ <25) or walk from Yakutpura (~25 minutes)."
"Situated near Charminar, it was the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty where the Nizam entertained his official guests and royal visitors."
"Built by Nawab Viqar al-Umra in 1872, Falaknuma is a stunning piece of architecture and the most opulent of the Nizam's palaces. The interior is particularly impressive and features the works of Florentine sculptors and a 100-seater Dining Table. The palace has been converted into a hotel run by the Taj group and is no longer accessible to the general public."
"The Golconda Fort was the capital of the Qutb Shahi kingdom. Set aside a minimum of 2 hr to do justice to your visit -- the outer wall measures 10 km. Learning a little about the fort ahead of time is recommended as it is easy to get confused or lost in the massive space. If you accept one of the local guides - who hustle you at the entrance gate - try to pick one who actually knows his stuff (₹ 500 per tour and the guide would also ask you for tips in the end, however it is entirely up to you whether to give tips or not), rather than someone who was actually just passing by, spotted you and will tell you bits he once read in a guidebook. The genuine old Muslim guide who gained his encyclopaedic knowledge of Golconda as an infant from his 118 year old grandmother knows the history of every inch of the place and will show you with expertise the echo/architecture system built into the fort that the ruler used as a communication/spying system. There is also a '''light and sound show''' - the story of Golkonda - for an hour, which could be a little boring,(price for foreigners ₹ 50/100 for normal/executive ticket) after sunset lasting ~1h that tells you the story of the fort and is worth seeing. The English show runs Nov-Feb 18:30 daily and Mar-Oct until 19:00 daily. Hindi and Telugu shows are run afterwards in certain days. Afterwards, have a wander through the tiny streets and shops surrounding the fort. The beautiful scruffy old shops and houses will sell you everything from naan bread to bangles, and the fading and gaudy old painted gates and houses are a delight, as are the friendly locals."
"Home to the famous wardrobe of Mahbub Ali Pasha, who is said never to have worn the same thing twice. It is the world's longest wardrobe, built in two levels with a hand-cranked wooden lift (elevator) in place. This occupies the entire length of one wing of the palace. Hard to find, take small road next to Princess Durru Shehwar Hospital, entrance gate."
"Mecca Masjid is one of the oldest mosques in the city and easily the biggest. Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah began building it in 1617 under the supervision of Mir Faizullah Baig and Rangiah Choudhary. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb completed the construction in 1694. The mosque is a granite giant with awe-inspiring innards. The main hall of the mosque is 75 feet high, 220 feet wide and 180 feet long, big enough to accommodate ten thousand worshippers at a time. It is believed that Muhammed Quli commissioned bricks to be made with the soil brought from Mecca and inducted them into the construction of the central arch of the mosque, which explains the name of the mosque. Women must mandatorily have dupatta / shawl to get entry into the premises. Women can not wear skin-tight pants or leggings into the mosque, so wear something loose-fitted."
"400 stairs brings you to a place of worship built by the Asif Jahis. The Moula Ali Dargah was built in the memory of Hazrat Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. Legend has it that Yakoob, a eunuch in the court of Ibrahim Quli, went to the hill after he saw Hazrat Ali seated on it. To his surprise, he saw the impression Ali's palm on a stone, which he had dreamt. He had the impression cut out and installed in a shrine. Ibrahim Shah later built a mosque beside the dargah. A Ashurkhana , a Baradari (pavilion) and an Nqqar khana (place for beating drums) were built during the Qutb Shahi period."

"The Qutubshahi mosques in Hyderabad are so named because they were built by the Qutubshahi dynasty. Most of them were built by Quli Qutb Shah, the founder. Sadly in May 2010 local newspapers revealed that shoddy 'restoration' work allegedly using unskilled labour with road drills (bought in by one government department that didn't bother to seek professional advice or inform the local archaeological or environment departments) has been damaging these beautiful buildings."

"This collection belonged to the Salar Jungs, Prime Minsters of Hyderabad, but has been augmented since.

"The industrial house of the Birlas have the tradition of building magnificent marble temples in cities of India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir. This one is one of the best. The temple manifests a blend of South Indian, Rajasthani and Utkala temple architectures. It is made of 2,000 tonnes of Rajasthani white marble. The granite of the presiding deity is about 3.4 m tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the roof. The consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. There is a brass flagpole in the temple premises which rises to a height of 13 m. Located on top of Naubat Pahad (mountain), this clean, sparkling white temple dedicated to Venkateshwara has viewing areas that afford a great view of the city. Sadly, cameras and camera mobiles are banned; your bags are checked at the entrance. Shoes are not allowed, so come early in the morning so the ground will not be too hot. There is a free cloakroom available for both electronics and shoes."
"The show at the planetarium lasts 35 min and is moderately interesting. The technological museum, on the other hand, is poorly maintained. The Dinosaurium at the upper level is interesting. It contains a complete skeleton of a dinosaur Kotasaurus yamanpalliensis discovered in the village of Yemanapalli in 1988. Modern Art museum is now located near the Dinosaurium (ignore the signboard near parking directing to lower level). It's the personal collection of Nirmala Birla; also quite interesting"

There is also an entire village where you can find realistic -looking sculptures of villagers carrying out their traditional crafts. You can also find a rock museum which contains natural rock formations that allegedly look life-like. Make sure you carry cash as credit cards are not accepted by most shops. Also next to Shilpa Ramam is Shilpa Sandhya Vedika, a location for eating and shopping."

"Located close to A.S. Rao Nagar is famous for its idol immersion events during the Ganesh Puja festival."
"This lake is famous as it has been lined by a solid strong wall on one side recently. A two lane undivided road is laid over this wall. The road is neat and exciting to drive. It has abundant lighting during nighttime and large pedestrian space provided. A problem is 'eutrophication' which is caused due to water hyacinth. A pleasant space for young couples to spend their evening. Smells sometimes, but that is the nature of any waterbody in a metropolis. Another important event that takes place is 'vinayakachaturthy', (a festival for Hindus in which Lord Vinayaka's statues are immersed in water). All roads lead to saroor nagar lake on the day of the ''Lord Ganesh's nimajjanam''."

Yes, one TV. A huge outdoor deck in this small house, that has indoor dining too. A good jukebox that is pumped outdoors and the best hush puppies this side of the Mississippi. Friendly staff, friendly locals. We'll hang out here for hours during the summer on the patio. Very dog friendly. 21+"
"An Indianapolis legend, this is where Ben Affleck filmed his first motion picture. You'll walk in to this joint and think you're back in WW II. It's been owned by the same folks since then. Model planes hang from the ceiling, awesome vintage art, and pennies on the ceiling that get tossed up and pulled down for donation each year (and thousands of them, seriously). A beer is served with a small glass and unique cheap eats are on the bar menu. There are rules here—don't put your feet on the chairs or booth seats, hang your coat up on one of the hooks, and don't get too obnoxious or you're out.

Stay in ""Arabian Nights,"" ""Le Cave,"" ""Geisha Garden"" or perhaps the ""Jungle Safari"" is your pick.

You can enter the caves in the lower part if you dress correctly (women MUST cover their hair and wear skirts, no shorts. Expensive scarves are for sale there). Women can only just get away with pants in the winter. Start at the Lower Lavra, visiting the caves before the crowds descend for the day. There are two cave complexes, each housing the mummified remains of monks, as well as religious icons and other relics. Both caves are accessed through churches, with the entrance to the shorter caves at the end of a boardwalk. While it is free to enter the caves, you must purchase a taper candle in order to light your way. The caves are not recommended for the claustrophobic or overly tall.

"This was established in the 12th century. Dorogozhychi quarter played an important role in the historical destiny of Kyiv. There the fate was solved for many princes pretending to the Kyivan throne on the one hand, and fate of Kyiv itself, on the other hand. Numerous invaders carried out from here their multiple attacks on Kyiv, and Kyivan princes conducted bloody battles with them. Such a strategic importance of this location became one of the reasons for foundation of a monumental church-fortress. In 1139 Vsevolod Olhovych, Prince of Chernigiv approached Dorogozhychi, an important strategic point, on the Kyiv’s north-western outskirts, gained possession of the area and simultaneously obtained a convenient bridgehead at the approaches to Kyiv. In 1140–1146 Vsevolod Olhovych erects St. Cyril’s Church at Dorogozhychi. Construction of a church-fortress is a logical step of Vsevolod as a prince-worrier, and prince-strategist, for the sake of fortifying outskirts of the “capital city” so desired by many. St. Cyril’s monastery is an example of a unique functional combination, because it is a sacred center, patrimonial palace church, and at the same time it is a monumental church-fortress. The church was named after Cyril, the holy hierarch Cyril of Alexandria — Christian patron of the church’s founder, prince Vsevolod Olhovych. - The most precious treasure of the St. Cyril’s Church is its unique '''mural painting'''. - In the 12th century walls of the St. Cyril’s Church were painted in fresco technique according to the Christian iconographic canons of that time. In the 17th century the fresco painting of the Church was partially renewed by means of tempera. In the 1800's, during repair of the Church its walls instead of painting were just plastered and whitewashed. - In the 1880s restoration works were carried out in the Church under the guidance of the professor of St. Petersburg University, A. Prakhov. At that time from under centuries-old layers of plaster and whitewash a unique Old Russian mural painting was discovered. However, soon after, in order to provide the mural painting for “grandeur” the frescoes were refreshed with oil paints. In the 1970s a large-scale restoration works on frescoes’ discovery from under layer of oil paint of the 19th century were carried out. - FRESCO painting: Monumental figures of twelve Apostles are located in window piers of the dome’s drum. Four Evangelists are portrayed on sails (architectural spherical triangles serving for transition from the drum’s cycle to the under-dome square). The representation of the EvangelisMark on the south-estern sail has preserved the best of all.- Central arches supporting the dome’s drum are decorated with images of theSeban Martyrs placedewithin medallions literally interconnected by means of loops and hoops. These representations form as if “alive holy chain” protecting the celestial sphere. In the central apse there is a figure of the Holy Mother, Orans with her hands raised in prayer. Oil painting of the 19th century represents the major part of the composition; of the ancient fresco representation only an edge of the Holy Mother’s blue chiton and a podium on which she is standing have survived. Beneath the Orans the Eucharist fresco composition is located featuring the scene of the Apostles’ holy communion, in which the Christ is depicted twice: at the left He serves the body of Christ (bread) to the group of Apostles headed by the St. Peter, and at the right He serves the blood of Christ (cup of wine) to the group of Apostles headed by St. Paul. Similar plot depicting two figures of Christ is already known in miniature of Rossan Code in Asia Minor dated with the 6th century. According to the canon which can be recognized already in the Church of San-Vitale in Ravenna, in the St. Cyril’s Church the center of the composition represents a double dome on pillars over the throne onwhich a cross, a paten with seven round flat breads, a cup of wine and an asterisk are placed. - '''Belfry''': Of the monastic buildings Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi constructed within the monastery, his most important construction was a free standing belfry, built in 1760. The belfry combined the idea of a tall campanile with a gate on the ground level and a chapel on the belfry's second tier. The two lower levels of the belfry had some elements of a Ukrainian tripartite church, consisting with the belltower placed over the central part of the nave. This architectural combination in a belfry with two apse-like lower elements on each side. The original roof above the belfry's chapel was a stepped-hipped roof, which was popular at the time. After the fire of 1849, the roof's over the chapel and the cupola were modified from the original. After the Ukrainian SSR's decision on the demolition of the belfry in 1936, the belfry was destroyed a year later, to be used as bricks in construction projects."
"This is a station on Kiev Metro's Kurenivsko-Chervonoarmiyska Line.

"Originated in the 16th century as the wooden church of Sts. Florus and Laurus.

"A large complex in the center of the city that features a Desert Living Center, interactive wildlife shows, galleries, museums, various gardens, and historical and nature trails."

If you're interested in science and history it's definitely worth visiting, and it's also a great break if you've become tired of the Strip. Videography requires special permission."
"A place to experience Asian culture."
"This route climbs gradually northwest of Las Vegas so that the Strip's neon lights remain visible for a remarkably long distance, appearing as a luminous cloud from the furthest point."
"Features hundreds of traditional/gear and sport routes. Climbing is possible year-round, though Spring and Fall tend to be most comfortable. There are a couple of guide books that detail the routes. Though the area does not receive much precipitation, it is worth remembering that if the sandstone becomes wet (from rain or snow) it becomes brittle and you'd be wise to avoid it for at least two day before checking if it dried out. There is also a scenic drive through Red Rock Canyon, which will take you about 30 minutes to complete, though there are opportunities to park up and get out of the car. Entry is $7 per car unless you have a National Park pass."
"In addition to being a gun store, the range gives you a chance to shoot an automatic weapon. Photo ID required. Beware long lines. A 2-3 hour long wait is not unusual on weekends and busy days."
"Old-style pinball machines and the newest ones from Stern are there, all in very good condition. Some favorite arcade games too. Definitely worth a look."
"Helicopter tours that will take you over the Grand Canyon or above the neon lights and mega resorts of the Las Vegas Strip, as well as helicopter tours that include rafting down the Colorado River."
"Pole dancing classes. For ladies aged 18 and over only. Advanced scheduling required."

"America's 2nd largest indoor theme park with 25 rides and attractions for all ages."
"A roller coaster that lifts riders up 203 feet, then drops down 144 feet, reaching speeds of 67 mph. Simulates a jet fighter's barrel roll, with a 180° turn, a section that leaving riders hanging in the air, then twists and dives."
"In addition to the observation desk on top, with its restaurant and great views of the city, there are four thrill rides on the top of the tower.

"Aerialists, jugglers, acrobats and trapeze artists take the stage at the world's largest permanent circus daily."
"A classic Cirque show, full of amazing feats, impressive costumes, and humor. Definitely worth the time and money. Although it's family-friendly, it verges on too intense and psychedelic for younger children, so consider avoiding for children who are under eight."
"The stage at the Bellagio contains a 1.5 million gallon swimming pool, from which most performers emerge and retreat to. It's an incredibly impressive show."
"An adult show. You must be 18 or older to attend."
"Spectacular show that tells a tale of imperial twins on a journey to fulfill their destinies."

"Las Vegas hosts NASCAR for a weekend every year, usually in March. The race draws about 150,000 race fans to the city. Many cheer for Kurt and Kyle Busch, natives of Las Vegas. Aside from NASCAR, the speedway hosts many other racing events throughout the year."
"Arguably the city's most prominent sporting event is the finals of the annual Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association circuit, held over 10 days in December just off the Strip at the Thomas & Mack Center on the UNLV campus."
"Another major rodeo event is the finals of the Professional Bull Riders series, a separate circuit dedicated to bull riding. The PBR finals, held in late October/early November at the T-Mobile Arena, have more of an international flavor than the NFR—while the NFR is exclusive to the US and Canada, PBR runs national series in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Australia, and all of these countries, especially Brazil, are represented on the U.S. circuit. The event had been held at the Thomas & Mack Center through 2015, but has moved to the newly opened T-Mobile Arena."
"The athletic teams of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, better known as UNLV, are also popular in the area. The Rebels are members of the Mountain West Conference, which has been expanding in recent years and now has 12 members for football and 11 members for other sports. The most famous UNLV team is the men's basketball team, known as the ""Runnin' Rebels""; though not as strong as in their heyday from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, they remain solidly competitive and very popular. Most of the school's sports venues are on campus, but the football team plays at Sam Boyd Stadium in the suburb of Whitney, well to the east of campus. The central ticket office for all UNLV sports is at the Thomas & Mack Center."
"From an international perspective, however, this may be the city's most prominent sporting event—at least among those who do not consider poker to be a sport. The ""Sevens"" refers to rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union played on a full-sized field but with seven players a side instead of 15. The USA Sevens is part of the [http://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series World Rugby Sevens Series], an annual circuit of 10 events for national rugby sevens teams. Games are very fast-paced—each half lasts only 7 or 10 minutes, as opposed to 40 minutes in the full version of rugby union. This allows many games to be played in a day, and a full tournament to be completed in a weekend. The event, held at Sam Boyd Stadium in the second weekend of February, features 15 other national teams beside that of the U.S., and encourages a festival atmosphere. If you're so inclined, it can be a great opportunity to meet people from other parts of the world."
"A twin-rink facility."
"Located in the western outskirts of Las Vegas, Downtown Summerlin offers 125 stores, restaurants and entertainment venues located in a 106-acre shopping district.  Downtown Summerlin hosts 30 dining establishments and is in proximity of many other restaurants nearby as well as the Red Rock Casino.  Plans exist to expand the area to 400 acres.  Opened in 2014."
"Offers nearly every major and deluxe U.S. retail chain store, numerous others often associated with named designers, a large food court and several excellent restaurants, all in a fully-enclosed, air-conditioned facility.  Has extensive, free covered parking that often gets quite busy by mid-day."
"About half a mile south of Mandalay is an outdoor mall in the style of a small Mediterranean town that stands out amidst all the air-conditioned, indoor malls. The idea of open-air shopping in the summer in the desert might seem crazy at first, but an extensive network of trees, shadow alleys and water sprayers let you actually enjoy sunny afternoons outside. All shops and restaurants here have their own, distinguished one- or two-story houses. The mall centers around a square featuring trees, ice-cream and coffee stands and benches to rest."
"A huge high-end shopping area that also offers free animatronics shows at Fountain of the Gods and Atlantis located at either end of the mall."
"Another massive shopping area that features the tacky ''objets d'art'' shop featured in Martin Bashir's interview with Michael Jackson."

"Featuring dishes from five French provinces, the Village Buffet offers exquisite classic French foods, some made to order, and seasonal specialties under a faux sky in a village-like setting. Patrons may, for example, choose to sit in a town square or French country home. Lines can be long. For an extra $10 per person, patrons can go to the head of the line."
"The casino changed names, but the buffet is the same. All styles of food including good seafood. Line moves fast."
"This buffet is one of the better buffets in Las Vegas, with an extensive seafood collection (as well as other items). Lines can be long. Note that the Rio also offers the Carnivale World Buffet, which is cheaper but does not offer a total seafood oriented buffet, but features a changing variety of dishes featuring seafood. Tables are close together, and can be noisy."
"16 exhibition cooking stations and a luxurious selection of extraordinary dishes. Dress is casual. Breakfast, lunch and dinner served, with champagne brunch on weekends."
"Arguably the best buffet on the Strip, with the dinner menu including pre-split crab legs, venison, Kobe beef, and wild boar. Gourmet Friday dinner includes Beef Wellington, Rack of Lamb, Veal Ossobuco, Grilled Swordfish, and Curried Duck Legs. The Buffet has spectacular selections from Italy, China, and Japan as well as fresh seafood and traditional American food. Wait to enter can be 90 minutes or more."

"Outdoor bar serving sliders. Great for stopping in for a few mini burgers and beers that won't fill you up on the way to your next destination. Waitresses are good-looking."
"Considered to be a hidden gem, The Steak House at Circus Circus doesn't seem fit in with its surroundings; indeed, it has been consistently voted one of the best steaks in Las Vegas for over twenty years. Beautiful decor, outstanding food, and impeccable service, as well as an extensive wine list."
"American cuisine that includes steaks, burgers, sandwiches, and even dishes like meatloaf and fried catfish. During the evening the restaurant features live country music bands."

"A revolving gourmet restaurant more than 800 feet above the Strip at the top of the Stratosphere Tower."
"Serves great tropical food. Large portions with a great atmosphere. Famous for their jerk chicken pasta, cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes, and wide variety of hand-crafted tropical drinks such as the Bahamarita. This is a great place to get away and relax from the crowds of people on the Strip."
"The $6.95 steak special is consistently voted one of the best deals in Las Vegas. It's not on the menu, so ask for it specifically. If steak is not your thing the restaurant has plenty of other selections at cheap prices. In addition, Ellis Island has barbecue every night from 4-10PM. Ellis Island also brews its own beer, and serves them in the casino bar in 20 oz glasses for $1.50."

"Juicy, succulent portions of the company namesake, Prime Rib. All prime rib dinners include original spinning bowl salad, Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes and whipped creamed horseradish. If you don't want prime rib (but why eat at a place called The Prime Rib if you don't want it?) there's always a ribeye steak available and a couple fish dishes."
"Decoration and staff are half pirate ship, half Suicide Girls, but the Mexican food (and the margaritas) are tasty and served in generous portions."
"Free Wi-Fi, salads, sandwiches. Mostly local crowd. Also features a record store."
"The Heart Attack Grill has courted controversy by serving high-calorie menu items with deliberately provocative names. The establishment has a hospital theme: waitresses (""nurses"") take orders (""prescriptions"") from the customers (""patients""). A tag is wrapped on the patient's wrist showing which foods they ordered and a ""doctor"" examines the ""patients"" with a stethoscope. The menu includes ""Single"", ""Double"", ""Triple"", and ""Quadruple Bypass"" hamburgers, ranging from 8 to 32 ounces (230 to 910 g) of beef (up to about 8,000 calories), all-you-can-eat ""Flatliner Fries"" (cooked in pure lard), beer and tequila, and soft drinks such as Jolt and Mexican-bottled Coca-Cola made with real sugar. Customers over 350 lb (160 kg) in weight eat for free if they weigh in with a doctor or nurse before each burger. Beverages and to-go orders are excluded and sharing food is also not allowed for the free food deal."
"Fine dining in the iconic Plaza Hotel and Casino. Named after former Las Vegas mayor and mob lawyer, Oscar Goodman."

"A video-game themed bar located in downtown Las Vegas within walking distance of the Fremont Street Experience. Guests can enjoy their favorite video games in this bar. VIP gaming booths are also available."

"Just like the movie, expect beautiful 20-something women serving you drinks and getting rowdy on the bar."
"Beach Club by day, Night Club after sundown, the most popular place for after hours on weekends, so expect long queues especially from 5AM.

"A mix of a pool and a club. Have a blast swimming around in one of the many pools, or swim (yes, swim) up to a bar and order your favorite drink. Not into getting wet? Relax at a cabana or day bed.  Bottle service is available. Live DJ's on select days."
"Officially, this $100 million 40,000 square foot club is the most expensive nightclub ever built. Popular among NBA stars and celebrities."

Other areas, only open on weekends, include the Pussycat Doll Lounge and the ultra exclusive (and expensive!) VIP Red Room, frequented by many celebrities."

"An upscale hotel located near the middle of the Strip, the Mirage features a ""volcano"" that erupts every hour, a white tiger exhibit, a 200,000 gallon tropical aquarium, and a tropical rain forest."

"Try harcho soup and fig salad."
"Has a touch of understated Habsburg grandeur. Homestyle quality."
"a kind of cultural centre, with hand-made glass souvenirs gallery, exhibition space, sculptures and movie screenings. There's a good small restaurant there and in summer also a beer garden."
"More units: 51, Volodymyra Velykogo Str, 37, Patona Str, 4, Stefanyka Str, 36, Generala Chuprynky Str, 5, Tershakovtciv Str, 59, Grushevskogo Str, 1, Valova Str, 51, Chervonoi Kalyny pr, 2, Sv. Teodora pl. Tasty pizza, soups, salads, cakes and beverages."
"You'll also see the city's sophisticated set sipping Under Clepsydra's famous forest tea. Under Clepsydra has three sections. The indoor café/restaurant inspired by the Parisian brasseries of the left bank has two sections, smoking and non-smoking, that share a soundtrack of classic French jazz and folk music. Upstairs you’ll find the more popular late-night section of the establishment. But what really sets it apart from other Lviv hangouts is the menu. Vegetarian restaurants in Lviv are, well, non-existent, but Under Clepsydra you’ll find a collection of fresh, meat-free dishes made with local ingredients.  Potato and mushroom crepes are less than €2, and fresh soups and salads are anywhere between €1-2. Menus are in English. The carnivorous set has plenty of options as well. Few dishes run more than €5, and entrees include duck, pork, grilled chicken, smoked salmon."
"Viennese-style cake and coffee."
"has a broad European and Ukrainian menu in a 5 star environment with 4 star food and 2.5 star prices."
"This place has menus in English and English-speaking staff.- The Wiener Schnitzel is great, so are all the soups, the breakfasts, the potato pancakes and the Apfelstrudel."
"(''Map''), , a quiet café with a special atmosphere and tasty Italian coffee. There are three large rooms for visitors: a large room on the first floor, and old-style rooms in the basement."
"Intimate, medieval."
"You’ll most likely see a man dressed in Olde Tyme regalia pacing in front of the entrance, beckoning people inside. If he’s not there another greeter awaits in the form of a metal statue sitting at a desk with a… you guessed it, lit gas lamp. Once inside you’ll find a spiral staircase ascending up three flights of dining space. Each floor is cozy, candle lit, and decorated with classic gas lamps. Gas Lamp also has one of Lviv’s best patios, in the form of their rooftop dining section. While the entrees are standard, the snacks that go with beer are real standouts. Try the seasoned croutons, chips and a variety of dipping sauces they’re the perfect accompaniment for their wide selection of cold local brews."
"A bar with small staircase connecting few floors and a roof terrace (great views!), where each room is differently designed around a theme of a Lvivian 'legend'."
"“Slava Ukrayini” - the phrase means ‘Glory to Ukraine,’ and it’s your ticket to this underground, unmarked bar called Kryivka. When you do finally find it, state the password to a man toting a prop vintage machine gun, receive your shot of medovukha, and descend into the cozy wooden dining room you’ll be glad you took the time to find. This Ukrainian Independence themed bar is decorated with artifacts from Ukraine’s valiant struggle to stay autonomous - with guns, maps and posters lining the walls. You’ll also notice the names of dishes on the English menu harken back to a military tradition stretching back to the Austrian Empire. Culinary highlights include a half-metre long sausage, pickles soaked in honey and savory vereniky. There is also a bit of theatre during a dinner at Kryivka. If you’re lucky, a “Russian spy” may have snuck in to the restaurant and the brave staff will turn off the lights, grab a flashlight, root out this spy and serve him a healthy portion of justice. Once the intruder has been detached, celebratory live music erupts in the basement venue and locals burst into traditional songs of freedom."
"A place where you get whipped by the bar staff. Yes, seriously."
"Follow the tree lined street of Kleparivska as it winds up and down hills until you reach the easy to spot entrance of this beer hall and concert venue. It’s attached to the Lvivske Brewery. Depending on the nights festivities you may have to pay a small cover charge, but it’s well worth it, as early evening acts often include international Jazz bands, and late evening events often fall into the feverish dance music category. Descend a flight of stairs past a little merchandise stand to the cavernous first room. Sit down at a long beer garten style table and order a giant stein of the Lvivske beer. The name, Robert Doms comes from the man who founded the brewery in 1715 (also the name of their signature brew). The underground location and stone walls give Robert Doms Beer House great acoustics and an intimate feel. Or, if you’re not in the mood for music, head to the adjoining Austrian style pub room. Plush, wooden and well lit, this is a great place to watch a game of football with friends as the giant TV at the end of the room has a habit of sucking in people's attention."
Mini-brewery.
"Cool underground bar."
"in the busy courtyard just off Doroshenka St. The name is written in Cyrillic as well as Latin, so have no fears there. Dublin does a good job of not packing the tables in too tightly, you after you’ve grabbed a seat, don’t be shy to get up and wander around a little bit with a pint of any of their host of international beers in hand. If you happen to be hungry, you’ll be glad to know that the menu is in English (though the staff don’t speak English), and features many of the pub favourites you would expect at home. However, you’ll find that many of these dishes have been modified slightly as local ingredients are substituted for traditional ones. If football is your thing, Dublin Pub spares no expense. If there is a game on, anywhere in the world, chances are Dublin Pub will be showing it live. However, if your side happens to be playing at the same time as any of Ukraine’s club, or national teams you might want swallow your pride and join in, as you’re not likely to find anyone here who will permit you to change the channel."
"Though it may sometimes seem like it, not every bar or restaurant in Lviv has some kind of theme or hook, and Korzo Pub is one of these places. - Nothing too fancy here, just an oak bar, brass taps and well worn tables that have eavesdropped on hundreds of conversations, arguments and romantic encounters. Korzo also has a great selection of international spirits, so if you’re the kind of person who needs a shot of tequila to get the night going, this is your place. As the beer flows, you might want to try the fish soup, hearty and robust, locals say it is the perfect ballast to prevent a hangover the next morning. If quenching your thirst on a sunny afternoon of exploring is your goal, Korzo has one of Lviv’s largest patios."
"Bizarre nouveau riche."
"Metro isn’t the easiest place to spot during the day, but at night, just follow the hordes of fabulously dressed young people as they make their way there. Entrance will probably set you back about €3 and once inside the first thing you’ll see is a large disco. A raised platform in the centre of the dance floor features male and female go-go dancers (and any braves who decide to join them on stage). A bar opposite provides local beers, vodka and champagne. For a change of pace, head downstairs where you’ll find two more bars. One serves the techno and house room, the other the lounge, private rooms and the hip hop dance floor. To cool off from all of the dancing, hit the giant upstairs patio with its heat lamps during winter and umbrellas for those rainy Lviv nights."
"Featuring the restaurant ""Tequila Bum"", a casino, a state-of-the-art movie theatre, billiards and video games, it has something for everyone. As the largest disco in Western Ukraine,  the entrance fee is a little steep compared to other local bars, but it rarely tops €5. Once inside, grab a table and sit back as bottles of vodka are delivered to your table or sidle up to any of four  cocktail bars for a beer, mixed drink or shot. DJs from all over Eastern Europe come to Millennium to spin house, retro, electro and rock tunes. Guys should be prepared to wear dress shoes, pressed slacks and a dress shirt. Ladies, Lviv girls are some of the most stylish in the world, so dress like you mean it. You might get into the club in your street clothes - but you’ll feel out of place."
"Picasso aims to be a relaxed alternative, in a large corner building. Getting in can be a little confusing. The door staff will point you to a door at the side of the building where you pay your entrance fee, usually between €3 and 5, and get a ticket. The first thing you’ll notice once inside is a giant vaulted ceiling with a ring of balconies surrounding the venue. Really, it looks more like a church than a club. At the far end is a massive stage, and below that, a roomy dance floor. Beers here run a little bit more than standard, but their selection caters to a more refined palate. The music and dress code here are also a bit more relaxed. Tunes range from disco to rock, with a little techno and house thrown in. One distinguishing feature of the music is volume; not cranked so loud you can’t hear yourself think, but not a library either. There is free coat check, and most patrons are dressed casually, which in Lviv means like models on their day off. The stellar lighting also makes this place a popular venue for concerts. As Lviv does not currently have a large music venue, many acts play Picasso if they can secure a night. The club also hosts private parties and events, so call ahead to make sure you can get in that night."
"If you’ve been to Metro Club you may have noticed a long line of locals trying to gain access to Pozitiff. This place is not easy to get into, and there are no guarantees that your money, passport or even begging can ensure you gain entrance. It’s all the bouncers call. Your best bet is to arrive with a small group of the most attractive people you can find. At this point the door man will either let you in, or not. If he does you’ll have negotiate an entrance fee. This cover charge usually depends on how cool and attractive your group is: The better-looking, the lower the fee. Expect to pay close to €6 for entrance. As entrance is so difficult, some patrons make the most of their trial, floating through the bar mingling, chatting and flirting. Others, displaying the icy confidence that got them in in the first place simply recline in their booth and radiate cool.  No matter how you choose to play this one you’ll find enough friendly professionals to chat with and if you need to check your email, the Internet café section remains operational even into the wee hours of a rocking party."

"Perhaps the best known plaza in Madrid, this impressive square is now one of the main stops on any tourist visit. Originally built outside the city walls, this enclosed square has played host to bullfights, markets, symphonies, tournaments and executions. Today it is ringed with tourist shops, cafes and restaurants. The statue of Philip III sits in the middle across from the '''Casa de la Panadería''', a beautifully painted building with two towers on the north side of the square (not to be confused with the ''other'' building with two towers on the opposite side) which once served as the headquarters of the bakers' guild and now houses a tourist information office. Access to the square is via one of the many arcades which connect to the surrounding pedestrian streets."
"This plaza is the heart of Madrid and one of the busiest places in the city - a hub for the local transit system, a favorite meeting spot for locals, a visible area for festivals or political demonstrations, and a opportune location for tour guides, street performers, pickpockets and anyone else looking to take advantage of all the tourists on hand. In the center of the plaza sits the '''Statue of King Charles III''' on horseback, facing the '''Royal Post Office''' (''Real Casa de Correos''), the red-and-white building adorned with a clock tower on the plaza's south side. Originally the building served as Madrid's first post office, then the police headquarters under Franco before being transformed into it's current use as the office of the President of Madrid, the head of the regional government. The clock tower is noteworthy for being the center focus of New Year's celebrations every year, which are broadcast across Spain and mark the traditional eating of the Twelve Grapes (one for each ring of the bell) and the beginning of a new year. In front of the building is '''Kilometer Zero''' (''Kilómetro Cero''), a plaque showing the point where the measuring of national highway system begins. On the east side of the plaza is the famous '''Bear and the Madroño Tree Statue''', a bear climbing a ''madroño'' tree, which is the symbol of Madrid, and on the west side of the plaza is the '''Mariblanca statue''', a white marble goddess of at least the XVII century. Nearby the giant neon '''''Tío Pepe''''' sign sits above the plaza and is a famous fixture of this area."
"The Palacio Real is an enormous palace, one of the biggest in Europe, with scorching plains of concrete around it. Though it is the official residence of the King of Spain, the royal family does not actually reside here and it is generally used only for state ceremonies. The Royal Palace is considered to be one of the most emblematic and beautiful buildings in Madrid, not only for its location on a bluff overlooking the river valley but also for its architecture and the artistic treasures to be found in its rooms. A simple one-way tour of the palace (both self-guided and guided are available) takes you up the grand stairway and through the lavishly decorated state rooms with their elegant tapestries, frescoes, porcelain, carvings and added decor like china, silverware, medals, etc. From the courtyard you can access the ''Farmacia'' (Pharmacy), which contains hundreds of bottles of early medicines and a reconstructed laboratory, and the ''Real Armorial'' (Royal Armory), a two-story collection of medieval weapons and armor. Explanations in the armory are in Spanish only, so do not expect to understand much unless your know the Spanish names for all that medieval weaponry. :The lines to get in are very long, especially on weekday evenings when the place is free – try to go early. Photography inside the palace is not allowed, but is permitted in the foyer and courtyard. Free storage lockers are available behind the ticket office."
"This massive cathedral faces the Palacio Real. Finished near the end of 20th century in the Neo-Gothic style, it is where the Princes of Asturias Felipe and Letizia were married in 2004. Especially noteworthy are the 5,000-pipe organ, a large painted 15th century Gothic altarpiece, and the empty 12th-century coffin of Madrid's patron saint, Isidro."
"A prominent square on the northwest side of central district, adjacent to two of the tallest buildings in Madrid: the Torre de Madrid (the taller, white one) and the Edificio España (the red and white one). The square contains a large fountain and a sculpture of Cervantes and his famous Don Quixote and Sancho Panza characters."
"Literally ""Great Way"" (better translated as ""Broadway""), Gran Vía is one of the busiest avenues in Madrid. Running from Plaza de España to Plaza de Cibeles, it is the location of the cinema district and a number of shopping malls and is lined with large billboards and lights. There's a constant buzz of traffic and life - 3-4AM early morning traffic jams are not unusual."
"A massive roundabout at the intersection of Calle de Alcala and Paseo del Prado, this plaza houses one of Madrid's emblems, the '''Fountain of Cibeles''', which portrays the Roman goddess of fertility sitting upon a chariot pulled by two lions. On the southeast corner dominating the Plaza is one of the world's most beautiful city halls, the '''Palacio de Cibeles''' (formerly the ''Palacio de las Comunicaciones''), an impressive structure with a jaw-droppingly spectacular façade. Inside, the building holds a cultural center with changing art exhibits and info on Madrid, and you can climb to the upper floors for some excellent views out the window. On the southwest corner of the square sits the imposing '''Bank of Spain''' (''Banco de España'') building, while the northeast corner is home to the '''Palacio de Linares''', which holds the [http://www.casamerica.es/ Casa de América], a cultural center with an art gallery of Latin American works."
"On the north side of the city and bisected by Paseo de la Castellana, this plaza is in the center of Madrid's skyscraper district. A tall obelisk sits in the center of the plaza while the '''Gate of Europe''' (''Puerta de Europa'') towers, two slanted towers which frame the boulevard, are situated on the north side of the plaza. Taking the #27 bus, which runs along Paseo del Prado and Paseo de la Castellana and ends at Plaza de Castilla, will take you pass several Madrid highrises. North of the Plaza is the '''Four Towers''' (''Cuatro Torres''), four sleek new skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain."
"Once a glass and iron market of the late XIX century, it is now a vaulted concrete building which still serves as a neighborhood market. Where it used to stand an annexed public swimming pool and sports facilities, it lies now an empty field, used and managed by a neighbor association."
"Near Plaza Mayor is this indoor market, identifiable by its ornate iron posts. Built in 1913, it's full of a wide range of high quality food. Even if you're not buying anything, it's worth entering for the sights and smells of dried ham, fine wine, freshly baked goods and other treats from the vendors inside."
"The main square during Middle Age, as Calle Mayor (High Street) was the main street as well. It houses the former City Hall, the former Academy of Fine Arts and the Archbishopric."
"One of the finest art collections in the world and the best collection of classical art in Madrid.

The museum only displays temporary exhibitions, usually of a very high quality, in fields ranging from archaeology to contemporary art and architecture."
"Beautiful museum with vast interesting collections about Spanish sailing."
"An excellent museum that many tourists miss. Houses thousands of artifacts from the Americas. The exhibit displays objects from many native cultures from before European conquest to colonial times and beyond. Don't miss the Tesoro (Treasure) de los Químbayas, a collection of gold objects that was given as a gift by the Colombian government. Also of interest is the Tudela Codex, an Aztec law book from the 1500s. Beware: most explanations to the objects on display are in Spanish only."
"This is a museum of two parts.

Most of the exhibits are explained in both Spanish and English."
"This museum is dedicated to the history of Madrid from 1561 to present. Much of the history is explained by referencing exhibited paintings depicting people or events from the time, so it is also an art museum. Several maps and models (including two large ones in the basement) show how Madrid grew since the 16th century. All exhibits are explained in both English and Spanish."
"This museum houses the stunning collection of Spanish entrepreneur José Lázaro Galdiano (1862-1947) and is considered to be one of the best private collections in Spain. Not only will you find works by Goya, Velázquez, El Greco and others - the museum is also filled with jewelry, furniture, sculpture and ceramics. It is located in Lázaro Galdiano's rather lavish former residence. This is an excellent museum that is usually not crowded and well worth the price of admission."
"This museum is in what was the impressionist painter's house and features fine furniture and porcelain as well as his paintings."
"Offers a wide selection of historical and more temporary costumes (from the early 1200s to now) which shows the aspects of different cultures and Spain. The museum also organizes many activities and events. The building itself won some architectural awards in the 1970s. The restaurant underneath the museum is fairly good. The museum is surrounded by sprawling gardens, replete with well maintained lawns and fountains, are a pleasant place to relax."
"Don't let the sound of it frighten you. This large, well-designed museum opened again in April 2014 after several years of renovation works. It houses an incredible collection of archaeological finds from across the peninsula. It leaves the visitor with a sense of the chronology of civilization in Spain (Iberian, Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Visigoth, Arab, and into the modern age).

"Part of the Spanish Institute of Geology and Mining, this museum is dedicated to Geology (with a focus on Mineralogy) and Paleontology, containing an impressive collection of fossils and minerals discovered on the territory of Spain and abroad. Also contains educational exhibits, although all are described in Spanish only. The interior of the building is just as impressive and may be worth a quick tour even if you are not particularly interested in Paleontology and Mineralogy."
"Small but interesting museum with artefacts and models from the indigenous people of Asia (mainly the Philippines, former colony of Spain), Africa and America. The exhibits are described in Spanish, however on each floor there is a leaflet in English explaining all sections."
"A few blocks off high-end shopping street Calle Serrano, this private foundation houses free temporary exhibitions of (mostly 20th-century) art which are often worth checking out. 10-15min walk from either Museo Lázaro Galdiano or National Archaeology Museum."
"The main park of Madrid, the perfect place to take a rest during a sunny day, or take part in the drum circles around the statue of Alphonso XII on summer evenings. There is a large boating lake where one can hire a rowing boat - great fun for the children! There is a monument to the victims of the Madrid 3/11 terrorist bombings, the ''Forest of the Absent'', and the ''Crystal Palace'', a large structure entirely made of glass. Sunday afternoons in summer are a treat in the park, where young hippies play bongos and dance."
"One of the most beautiful parks in Madrid. Built in 1797-1839, it has a strong Romanticism influence. Declared as an Historic Garden, its lakes with swans and ducks, labyrinths, palaces, squares and fountains makes this a lovely place."
"An Egyptian temple, located in one of Madrid′s most beautiful parks. Near the Royal Palace and Plaza de España, it was a present given by Egypt to Spain for its role in saving the temple of Abu Simbel from the floodwaters of Lake Nasser following the construction of the Aswan Dam in southern Egypt. A great place to watch the sunset."
"The rose garden of Madrid, located in the same park as the Templo de Debod. If you like roses and are in Madrid when they have flowered, definitely worth a visit. The garden holds an international competition yearly."
"The park at the rear of the Palacio Real which used to belong to the Royal family. Much of the park has been taken to smaller activity parks such as the Zoo but in general it's peaceful. From Moncloa you can take a ''teleferico'' (5.90 € return) across into the park."
"See the Pandas. Pet the Lemurs. Watch the Dolphin show. Enjoy the Bird show."
"Zoological park. Different sections of the park include animals from different locations (Africa, Antarctica etc..)"

"For football fanatics, a trip to the ''Santiago Bernabeu'', the home of local club Real Madrid is not to be missed. Real Madrid is the most successful football club in Spain and Europe, having been crowned Spanish champions a record 32 times and European champions a record 11 times. Their biggest rivals by far are FC Barcelona, with which it contests matches known popularly as ''El Clásico'' at least twice a year. The rivalry between the two sides is by far the biggest in Spain and one of the most intense in the world, and stems from the longstanding traditional rivalry between the Spanish and Catalan speaking parts of Spain. As such, tickets for such matches often sell out very quickly. In case you arrive in Madrid on non-match periods, you can take a self-guided tour of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. It includes tours around the field, the dressing rooms, the Press Room and the Real Madrid Museum where the trophies and other memorabilia are kept. Without a loyalty card, the typical fees for adults is €16. However, a few days before a match, the chances are you will not be able to take the full tour, but only a part of it, with at least the Real Madrid Museum, at a reduced price."

It got its name from the Portuguese fleet sailing under the flag of the Order of Christ (''Ordem de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo''). The fort is an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011.

Many exhibits come from the Portuguese frigate Santo António de Tanna that sank in 1697, including African and Indian pottery, Chinese china, different objects used by the crew and two bronze cannons. Another part of the collection is dedicated to archeological finds from the Kenyan coast.

"This is a beautiful building, one of the libraries donated by Andrew Carnegie, and its exterior merits a look before or after you visit the interior. The museum is on the second floor. Some of the temporary exhibits are quite worthwhile, and the permanent exhibits, which tell the black history of Oakland in text, pictures, and videotaped interviews, are really well done. Check the AAMLO web site for information on special exhibits, programs and events, such as an African American walking tour of downtown Oakland."

"Commanding one of the most breathtaking views in the East Bay, the Temple can be seen from nearly anywhere facing it, lit up like a beacon during the evening hours. Though it has extensive grounds and a visitor center, it is still a place of worship, so be respectful."
"The hills behind the Mormon Temple and to the east of Oakland's bustling streets are home to this, where redwood groves and trees and trails and wildlife help even the most weary traveler forget that a city lies at the elbow of the wilderness. Redwood is just one of a string or regional parks running along the crest of the Oakland Hills. To the north are Huckleberry Botanical Preserve and Sibley Volcanic Regional Park while to the south is Anthony Chabot Regional Park. All have trails that interconnect with Redwood"
"A former movie theatre, the Fox was built in 1928. It closed its doors in 1970 and stood empty until 2009, when it reopened as a 1,500-2,800 seat music venue, following a two-year, $75 million renovation.

"Known as ""The Team of the Demons,"" the Raiders have a long tradition of performance-enhancing drug use, commanding the fierce support of Oaklanders and enjoying a large fan base across Alameda County. Be sure to enjoy the famous pre-game tailgating scene in the Coliseum parking lot, as well as the Black Hole Sun of hard-core fans in the endzone section. Most home games are not sold out, so it should be possible to buy tickets up until game time."
"With nine trophies to their name, four since relocating to Oakland, they are one of the most successful franchises in baseball. The A's also have the best deal in baseball: $2 tickets and $1 hot dogs for nearly every Wednesday game. The cheap tickets sell out quick, so buy a day or two in advance. In the baseball configuration, the Coliseum has the odd distinction of having the most foul territory of any MLB field, and by a large margin."
"The Warriors play a fast, loose, and desperate type of basketball, a departure from a typical winning NBA team. After moving from Philadelphia to San Francisco, the Warriors settled in the East Bay and won their second championship in the 1970's and a third in 2015. Prices are on the lower end for the NBA ($1 to over $25), though cheaper tickets sell out for most games and all tickets sell out for big games up to a week before."
"This beautiful Art Deco theater (built in 1926) shows first-run movies. It has a spectacular neon sign that is lit on weekends, and is famous for the ultra-liberal (and sometimes conspiracy-minded) weekly sign proclamations from the theater owner. At Friday and Saturday evening shows, an organist plays standards in the main theater."
"A second-run movie theater, the Parkway does not have screens in the traditional sense. Movies are projected at the flat white concrete walls, with large comfy couches to sit on. Best of all, they serve pizza, salads, and beer that you can eat and drink while you watch a movie."
"The oldest still-operating theater in Oakland (built in 1917), completely restored and renovated in 2010 shows first-run movies. Saturdays are frequently marked by the showing of art-house and independent films."

"A hands-on art workshop aimed at kids ages 6-15, covering topics like illustration and architecture and sculpture and even DIY art to wear!"

"Old-fashioned record and CD nook - stacked high with boxes of LPs"
"JLS's mix of gentrification, working warehouses, and tourism make it a place to find pricey and stylish restaurants that give San Francisco a run for its money. You'll also find some off beat and interesting fusion restaurants, too."
"An apartment complex and shopping center located at the heart of Chinatown."
"Home to the area's largest Safeway, this shopping center is about halfway between Rockridge and Piedmont Ave. and is frequented by residents from both."

"Very no-frills burger stop that has all the basics and its own parking lot."

"A small and bright local favorite for inexpensive Cambodian food."
"Although California Governor Jerry Brown visited this place during his term as Mayor of Oakland (a framed picture of him and the restaurant owner is proudly displayed), this restaurant has the characteristics of a local, ""dirty but delicious"" gem. Noodles are made fresh, right in the restaurant. Often crowded with local Chinese, and so when busy one may have to wait a while to get a table."
"Rivals the best you'll find in Shanghai. The decor is minimal but the staff is friendly. Xiaolongbao (steamed dumplings) and Szechuan style shredded pork are two highlights."
"This is the best restaurant in Chinatown for a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. Be sure to order a noodle soup and fish cake(with a sweet and sour salad)."

"A little hole in the wall that serves up authentic Salvadorean food at excellent prices."
"A small, outdoor patio restaurant that features seafood but has the regular fare of typical Mexican restaurants. Authentically spicy, so make sure you request no salsa or jalapeños if that is your preference. A former burger joint turned-taqueria, this eatery is good for lunch and best enjoyed in fair weather with a refreshing agua fresca, as tables are exclusively on the outdoor patio."
"Authentic Mexican food, best known for its tacos, salsa bar and low prices."
"Could be considered the best taco truck in Oakland, with fare that by far surpasses most restaurants. Their burritos are over 12"" and unbeatable. Contrary to popular belief, taco trucks (especially this one) are sanitary and often have food as good or better than what one can find in standard restaurants. As there is no place to sit, people eat standing up next to the taco truck, or in their cars. There is a parking lot with free parking."

"A gathering spot for meat-eaters, based on a West African concept of the same name - it is a bit pricey for what is offered, but the quality of the meat is excellent. Full catering menu."
"The best chicken and waffles in the Bay Area. Cheap, open late, good drink specials (though the beer & wine is pretty standard, nothing to get excited about), it's a local institution. A diner style decor, lots of televisions (some tables even have televisions), and wonderful, attentive service. Full catering"
"Swanky, rather old school Italian restaurant right on the waterfront."

"Seafood, some American standards and a full bar, definitely paying for the atmosphere. Private events space available. Reservations available."

"Mid-April. Songkran is the Thai New Year, celebrated primarily by everyone throwing prodigious quantities of water at anything that moves. Pattaya officially celebrates Songkran on later dates (April 18–19) than most of the rest of the country (April 13–15) - but in reality the fun just starts early and keeps on going that much longer. During this period many hotels and guest houses have high occupancy levels, and public transport services (especially buses to/from Bangkok) are very busy, with more frequent than normal departures but also with appreciable delays due to the general mayhem on the roads. Songkran in Pattaya follows the same overall pattern as seen elsewhere in Thailand, but is especially vigorous in areas such as Soi 7 and Soi 8. Expect to get very wet indeed and you're unlikely to be disappointed - regardless of where you go or what else you actually plan to do.

"Very good tea, more than 80 flavours and they also sell more than 6 flavours of coffee beans. Prices on herbal teas start from 39 baht per 100 grams, on green Oolong tea from 70 baht, coffee 30 baht per 100 grams."
"It has good food including cheap Isaan treats, such as ''som tam'' (papaya salad) and ''khao neow'' (sticky rice). The Big C Extra stand, usually near the parking garage entrance, has inexpensive sandwiches."
"Good restaurant and bar, notable for its 65 baht breakfasts. Service is fast and efficient, but brusque and cold. Free Wi-Fi."
"There are several spots for fish and chips or roast beef and Yorkshire pudding: '''[http://www.sportsmanpub.com/ The Sportsman]''' (Soi 13). They have a quiz night every Thursday, 21:00. '''[http://www.pigandwhistlepattaya.com/ The Pig and Whistle]''' (Soi 7) and '''[http://www.queenvictoria-inn.com The Queen Victoria Inn]''' (Soi 6)."
"Good Western and Thai food including narm tok mu (spicy pork salad) and yum pla dook fu (crispy catfish salad)."
"Italian-style pizzeria."
"Finnish restaurant, huge portions. On some of the dishes ""if you're still hungry, you get the second one free."" Their homepage is in Finnish only, but according to it they have rooms for rent (THB300-800/night or THB7000-18 000/month depending on the season). Other services include scooter rental and Finnish sauna and they also arrange sports events such as bowling, golf, mölkky (a Finnish throwing game) and pesäpallo (Finnish baseball)."
"Serves pretty good Austrian food."
"In business since 1965, this is a super restaurant on the water in an unlikely Walking Street location. Seafood is a speciality, but the menu has sections devoted to Western food, Thai food, Italian food, Chinese food, and Japanese food. Extensive wine cellar. Attentive, friendly staff and reasonable prices."
"Iranian restaurant serving high quality modern and traditional Persian food including kebab and khoresht. Iranian drinks like ''doogh'' as well."
"Serves Thai and Western foods. Set in a garden which is ideal for a relaxing dinner or a small party. Recommended dishes include sautéed salted roasted duck, the shell in hell, chilled prawns, and goong lava (deep fried prawn with Thai herbal dressing and whipped cream on top)."
"An American-style pizzeria. Also burgers and subs."
"Serving Tex-Mex favourites including burritos, enchiladas, tacos, taquitos, quesadillas, and free chips with salsa, as well as American favourites including burgers, steaks, hoagies, Cajun, and seafood."
"Japanese steakhouse restaurant chain."
"The restaurant serves excellent seafood and Thai dishes."
"Fine dining restaurant serving both European cuisine and some Thai dishes."
"American chain restaurant. The reason to go here is that some beautiful Thai ladies seem to think it's cool."
Steakhouse.
"Asian and Mediterranean fusion. Sunday brunch."
"Garden restaurant with Italian and Swiss cuisine. If the eating is as interesting as the website, it's pretty good."
"Beautifully designed restaurant on the beach. Slightly outside of Pattaya."
"Very cheap."
"A small middle-range indoor place that's 100% lacto-vegetarian and has a vegetarian owner/manager who speaks good English; also caters for vegans."
"Basic café-style budget place, also has a very small vegetarian supplies shop. Not much English spoken, but does have a bilingual menu."
"Meets at 18:00 on the second Tuesday of every month for an ""international vegetarian adventure buffet"" (199 baht, reservations required - at Café New Orleans, Soi Pattayaland 2 (Soi 13/4)."
"Should have been named ""Walking, Shopping, Eating, Drinking, Dancing and Ogling Street"" as there's plenty of almost everything here—including around 100 beer bars and at least 30 go-go bars, plus many more in the side-sois that lead east towards Pratamnak Road. Worth a look in the daytime, but best visited in the evening, and has loads of restaurants if you're bridging the gap between the two. Gets really packed in places when the nightclubs empty, so watch your pockets."
"Soi Pattayaland 2 (Soi 13/4) features on many Pattaya postcards—when lit up at night, the go-go bar signs are a memorable and photogenic sight, although there are only eight go-go bars here (two of which feature guys, not girls), plus a half-dozen bars and the Penthouse Hotel. Worth a look in the evening (it's almost a ghost town the rest of the time), but get there before 01:00 as that's when the lights go out."
"Features only male dancers and bars that cater for the gay crowd; Soi Pattayaland 1 (Soi 13/3) has even more all-male go-gos (eight), but does have a couple of girl-go-go bars as well. Pattayaland 1 is relatively dead in the daytime, but Pattayaland 3 has a handful of places to eat and drink that keep it ticking over in the afternoon. There is also a small lesbian scene in Pattaya, with local butch girls called ""tom"" girls and femme girls called ""dee""."
"Connecting Soi Diana with Soi Buakhao, Soi L.K., as it is called (not to be confused with Soi Leng Kee) is for the largest part a pedestrianised street. Cars are parked willy nilly, but that actually serves as a traffic calming system so it is safe to walk down. There are lots of outdoor bars and cafes spilling out onto the street, giving it a ""bit"" of a European feel. The Metropole Hotel and the Areca Lodge are here."
"There's always something going on here—in the evening and early hours, there are about 120 well-staffed beer bars to choose from, plus a handful of go-go bars; in the morning there are several places that serve breakfast; in the afternoon it's a popular place for those who like to get started early; and at ''Songkran'' (Thai New Year) it's unmitigated mayhem. There are several large hotels (light sleepers beware), and Soi 8 also has a few travel agencies, convenience stores, etc."
"Imagine a kerb-crawlers paradise—and then pedestrianise it. Arguably Pattaya's most colourful street (as well as the most notorious one), Soi 6 has about 50 bars (mostly ""short time"" bars, with names such as ""Butterfly"", ""Love Club"", ""Route 69"" and ""The Eager Beaver"") which all get going at 13:00 and close pretty much on the dot at 01:00. It's not really a pedestrian-only street (but it is one-way), however walking — preferably in broad daylight — is undoubtedly the best and most popular way to experience it. Go in the middle of the afternoon and just wander from one end to the other (if coming from the south, walk from the Second Road end down to the Beach Road end if you want to get there and back by songthaew). It's much, much more ""sex-tourist"" than ""tourism"" oriented, but anyone is welcome everywhere provided they're buying a drink or three. The curiously named ""Hi Boss! 2002 Pub"" is where the ladyboys hang out, there's one go-go, ""Mandarin"" (dancing from 17:00-01:00), plus a couple of ""pub"" food possibilities; and neighbouring Soi 6/1 has a handful of ""ordinary"" outdoor beer bars."
"A collection of about 35 very popular beer bars, which start to fill up from about 16:00, and several of which remain open long after the lights go out around 01:00-02:00. ""Atlantic Bar"", at the far end of the five-bar strip to the south of Soi 2, always draws a substantial crowd. The only go-go (""Classroom 2"", 19:30-02:00) is a lively one, and while there's not much in the way of food in amid the bars themselves, there are numerous eating options close nearby (including outlets for most of the major fast-food chains directly opposite on the other side of Second Road)."
"Not the only ""table dance"" format a-go-go in Pattaya, but it's probably the most popular. Patrons are seated around industrial-strength tables which have mirror tops, upward facing spotlights, and of course the obligatory chrome pole; the girls dance on each table in turn, wearing short skirts. If you can't guess the rest then you should probably steer well clear of any Pattaya establishment that mentions the words ""table dancing"" alongside its name. UPDATE: ""dance tables"" have been removed, this place now using a standard go-go dance floor in the centre of the room."
"Can usually be found blindfolded. Head through to the back and out into the bars that target visitors from the Middle East, and feel the sound. Some of the speaker systems here are bigger than a budget hotel room, and it's not difficult to position yourself so that you're being deafened by three or four of them (each one playing something different) all at the same time."
"A pair of circular revolving outdoor bars. A couple of drinks here and the world really will start to revolve around you."
"A go-go with a difference. Not only do the girls dance with their clothes on, but there are no chrome poles! Whatever will they think of next? Update: they also have several shows each night, with girls dancing topless. Despite the name, it's not a casino; maybe it's a disco-a-go-go? The atmosphere is lively, the music is house/techno, the dancing is energetic. It's apparently able to close later than most due to the non-conforming format)."
"Probably the largest go-go in Pattaya. Several stages with young women in various different states of attire. Always full of energy, and always packed (you may be turned away if it's full). Good value drinks-wise."
"A crush of about 25 open-air beer bars surrounding a boxing ring (exhibition matches at various intervals between 22:00-01:00) The boxers will canvas the punters for tips after each ""fight"". Get there early in the evening and it looks like there must be a prize on offer for whoever is able to squeeze the greatest number of bar girls into the smallest beer bar."
"An otherwise relatively run-of-the-mill go-go that plays nothing but DVDs, with a very strong bias towards live performances of rock 'n roll classics. Requests welcome. If in doubt, ask for Meatloaf's ''Paradise By The Dashboard Light''. Stage and screen come to life at 18:00 and keep going until at least 02:00 (closing hours not so strictly enforced here as it's not among a bunch of other bars), but get there early as it's a popular place and their army of dancers thins out with prodigious speed."
"Features the Lam Morrison Band."
"34th floor rooftop bar. Very high-end, for taking someone special. Great views, particularly at sunset and after dark. Happy hour, 2 for 1 drinks, 17:00 to 19:00, perfect timing for sunset viewing."
"Clean, airy, well-run beer bar in a great location to view the passing scene before plunging into Soi 7. Very accommodating and gracious, relaxed (not pushy) bar girls. Best feature is strong, free Wi-Fi."
"House music, cheap drinks, late license, European DJ's."
"This club is known for bringing the world's top 10 DJs to Pattaya and also for its live R 'n B band. The place to go from 22:00 to 00:30 thanks to the Happy Hour. All drinks as cheap as 39 baht between 8pm and 10pm."
"Popular with young Thai people, although this is not a typical Thai discothèque. Only R 'n B, sometimes with special guest DJs. A good place to go at about 02:00-03:00. Extremely crowded after midnight. Free entry, expensive drinks."
"Large dance floor and plays house music (it's the house music counterpart of Lucifer). Free entry, but drinks are expensive."
"The same music as Marine Disco. This was the place to go before Insomnia opened."
"R 'n B and house rooms (two rooms in one disco). Drinks are expensive."
"Has an attractive and stylish interior, great live music and service. Free entry, but incredibly expensive drinks - and a 5,000 baht fine if you're caught bringing your own in!"
"Not as well known as Tony's Entertainment Complex, but also very pricey."
"Not Star Dice Beach on Beach Rd. One of the few discos in Pattaya that doesn't dual-price foreigners."
"Open air venue, it hosts afternoon parties with the best view of sunsets in town each Friday and each second Saturday - grand fiestas, each of them has a different theme: Brazilian, disco, house, etc."
"Great own brewed coffee, popular with expats"
"Good coffee, cakes and breads. Partially air-conditioned"

There are 9 ""first come-first served"" rooms at 650 baht (which are clean and functional, but rather well-worn) and 100 more recently renovated rooms. Popular with German tourists. Apex has no Internet or Wi-Fi. Serves all-you-can-eat buffets. American breakfast from 07:00-13:00 (150 baht) and dinner from 18:00-22:00 (250 baht)."

"Many decent rooms, Wi-Fi, elevator and ground floor swimming pool. Small lockers provided next to reception, but no strong boxes in rooms."
"Although the rooms themselves are clean and the staff is reasonably friendly, its location, right in the heart of Soi 6, is downright noisy and the shouting in the street does not subside till early morning. Free Wi-Fi."
"At the tranquil end of Pattaya, yet only a minute away from all the fun and entertainment at the resort's centre."
"A mid-range budget hotel next to Pattaya Beach. Cheap, clean and convenient. CCTV security camera on every floor with 24-hour security guard on duty. Cheaper rooms in the old building are a little bit dingy, superior and deluxe rooms in the new wing are spacious and pleasant, but significantly more expensive."

"Impressive Buddhist-style Independence Memorial, commemorating the departure of the French in 1953, dominates the centre of the city. Nearby is the Stalin-style Liberation Memorial, marking the Vietnamese capture of the city in 1979. The area is especially popular on weekend nights with locals when multi-coloured fountains are activated and communal music is played."
"This place is not for the squeamish. A former Chinese cemetery, this is where the Khmer Rouge killed many thousands of their victims during their four-year reign of terror. Today the site is marked by a Buddhist stupa packed full of over 8,000 human skulls. The sides are made of glass so the visitors can see them up close. There are also pits in the area where mass graves were unearthed, with ominous scraps of clothing still to be found here and there. It is a serene yet sombre place. Regularly throughout the day, a small museum screens a documentary with gruesome video images of human remains that were unearthed when the mass graves were found in 1979. Visit after learning about the Khmer Rouge terror at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. As millions were killed during the traumatic genocidal regime of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, as a sign of respect, wear respectable clothing such as long pants and no sleeveless shirts or tops. Flowers and incense can be bought in front of the stupa. In 2005 the memorial site was sold to a for-profit private company [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0503/p06s01-woap.html]. A tuk-tuk to the site should cost USD9-11 return (after haggling, of course), including stopping at the Genocide Museum on the way and waiting for you at both places."
"Contains an excellent collection of art from Cambodia's ""golden age"" of Angkor, and a lovely courtyard at the centre. A main attraction is the statue of King Jayavarman VII (1181-1219) in a meditative pose. Other exhibits worth seeing include graceful statues of Hindu gods, ancient stelae (tablets) inscribed in Sanskrit and old Khmer, and artefacts from a prehistoric burial site. No photos may be taken inside the museum, although photography is allowed in the central courtyard upon payment of a small fee (cameras: USD1, video cameras: USD3). In the middle of the courtyard is the original statue of the ""Leper King"" (actually Yama, the Hindu god of death) from the terrace of the Leper King in Angkor Archaeological Park. The pleasant little park in front of the museum is the site of the annual Royal Ploughing Ceremony, at which the success or failure of the coming harvest is determined. You may have heard stories of sightseers carrying umbrellas inside to avoid showers of bat droppings, but the bats moved out after the renovation of 2002."
"Built in the 1960s for the Asian Games that never happened, this interesting complex in the Modern-style has been sold off to the Taiwanese, in a murky deal by the Cambodian government. The new owners have recently renovated it and it has begun to be used once again as a venue. However in the evenings a walk around the top perimeter is worthwhile: you can see hundreds attending exercise and dance classes, and get a view of the abandoned track below. There is also an Olympic-size swimming pool and diving pool with a 10 m platform open to the public opposite the main building, across the track."
"The King of Cambodia still lives here, but much of the palace is open to the public.  The manicured gardens are nearly as dazzling as the colorful glass tiles of the palace roof. The two magnificent pagodas in the Palace Grounds, the Silver Pagoda and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, are among the few public buildings in Phnom Penh really worth seeing. They were built in the 19th century with French technology and Cambodian design, and have survived the traumas of the 20th century amazingly well. See them early in the day before it gets too hot. No photography is allowed inside the Silver Pagoda and some of the palace buildings. You're expected to dress decently (no bare legs or shoulders), but you can buy sarongs and oversized T-shirts for USD $2-3, or you can rent T-shirts and sarongs for a token 1000 riel at the entrance. Shorts that cover your knees are okay. In general, the palace complex has a more structured, formal, organised, and harmonious layout with a clear and specific architectural style rather than in Bangkok which has more hodgepodge of styles taken here and there."
"Phnom Penh is a bite-sized town, and it's easy to combine sightseeing, shopping, eating and drinking into a single walk through the city. The key to connecting the dots is the town's riverside promenade, Sisowath Quay, which runs along the west bank of the Tonle Sap River.  This is a 3&nbsp;km strip filled with vendors, locals, tourists and expats, and lined with hotels, restaurants, bars cafes and shops. Every morning the Quay kicks off with a life affirming exercise session to some interesting music - while birds fly and turn in pattern formation overhead. It's fronted by a large, long open space with manicured lawns, palm trees and open pathways, all recently re-done as part of a Japanese funded project to upgrade the flood infrastructure along the river. The built-up side of the street is home to cafés and shops and the better class of bar, and is popular with tourists and expats prepared to run its gauntlet of touts selling drugs, girls, and tuk-tuk rides. Unfortunately the river front (once seen as Phnom Penh's ""safe"" area) is no longer entirely safe for tourists. Tourist police are supposedly present in plainclothes. The esplanade along the river is also popular with Cambodians, who come here in the cool of the evening to enjoy the quasi-carnival atmosphere. It begins at the river front park opposite the royal palace, and is perhaps best experienced in the early evening. Dawn at Sisowath Quay is also a busy time, with locals doing calisthenics in front of the royal palace, and the sun rising over the river. In addition to the recent brick attacks on foreigners, there are supposedly child gangs and pickpockets so extra caution is warranted."
"A school converted into Cambodia's most important prison in 1975. More than 14,000 people were tortured here before being killed at the killing fields; only 8 prisoners made it out alive. The museum is easily accessible and a must-see for everyone interested in Cambodia's horrific recent past. The infamous ""skull map"" has been dismantled, although there are still skulls stacked in cabinets, implements of torture and disturbing photographs of people dying. For an introduction and further reading, try David Chandler's ''Voices from S-21'' (ISBN 0520222474). Documentary movie ''S-21'' can be purchased in Phnom Penh for USD1.50-2. There is also a short movie screening featuring some survivors that plays at 9:30AM upstairs in the far building. A hefty slice of your Tuol Sleng entrance fee will go into the pocket of the museum's director, who is the son of the responsible government minister. (This is perhaps the main reason the museum is in rather shabby condition, and the displays so unimaginative.) And a warning to those who patronize the souvenir shop. Don't get conned into buying some vintage Rolex, Patek Philippe, or Omega watches. They are fakes and are worthless. The owner is very convincing and will tell you that it is a collection from her husband. Instead, right across from the museum (No 54 & 56, St 113, Phnom Penh is a little shop called CHA (http://www3.online.com.kh/users/wthanchashop) that sells inexpensive handmade goods that are made by women disabled from polio and land mines. If you ask, you will also be able to tour the shop, meeting the female workers and seeing where they study English."
"Historically the wat favoured by royalty. In the 1930s it housed a charming young novice named Saloth Sar, who ""never caused anyone any trouble, never started fights - a lovely child"". Later in life he changed his name to Pol Pot."
"This hilltop pagoda marks the spot where the city was founded, and is always busy with pilgrims and fortune-tellers.  You may also spot Sam Bo, the city's only elephant, who has been giving tourists rides for over 40 years. The temple itself is notable more for its historic importance than physical structure, but the park is a pleasant green space and a popular gathering place for locals. A few monkeys keep quarters there as well and will help themselves to any drinks you leave unattended."
"Dates back to 1422 and is one of the five original founding monasteries of Phnom Penh."
"Offers free meditation session on Mondays and Thursdays at 6:00PM."

"A running club that meets every Sunday at 14:15 at the railway station."
"A great way to help some of the local poor people in a positive and rewarding way is to help the expat run charity called Choice. They help provide food and basic supplies to about 200+ extremely poor families as well as medical assistance if needed. They also provide vocational training and feed and send many children to local schools and universities. Skilled volunteers especially teachers are welcome to help."
"Film screenings. Fewer with English subtitles than there once were."
"Boats leave every evening for a river cruise. Many provide snacks or dinners at sunset. Be sure to visit Mekong Island to see rural life."
"Daily 20 km bicycle ride with Grasshopper Adventures, along small trails along the rivers and criss-crossing the islands (4 ferry hops) to explore the lush green countryside around Phnom Penh."
"Art gallery, bar, mini-cinema and production house. Shows free, high quality foreign and Cambodian films Tu-Su nights at 19:00 in the bar-lounge on the roof."
"The only casino in Phnom Penh."
"If considering visiting one of the orphanages do be aware that they may be exploitative and poorly run. Your money may go to the owner rather than the children. There are few if any legitimate orphanages in Phnom Penh: almost all are scams. Also, accepting impromptu visits from unscreened foreigners is often a sign of a substandard orphanage which does not have the children's best interests at heart. If you really want to help, try contacting organisations like this one that run educational programs, and see if there is any way you can assist."
"The pioneers of diving in Cambodia, providing comprehensive diving and snorkelling services, day trips, liveaboards, nitrox and a full range of PADI courses from beginner to instructor. Flexibility is the key: you can do training sessions while sightseeing in Phnom Penh, then finish with a liveaboard on the only custom made diving boat in Cambodia."
"Shooting range run by a unit of the Royal Cambodian Army. For a pretty hefty fee you can fire everything from pistols to machine guns at paper targets. Moto drivers, apparently oblivious of the reaction most visitors have, will try to include this in a trip to the killing fields and will take a nice commission for taking you there."
"An alternative tour experiences platform, they enable locals to offer authentic and unique activities to tourists such as fishing on the mekong like a local fisherman, coconut carving workshops, Cambodian Boxing, Apsara dance classes, even a fear factor challenge where you learn to cook insects which are sold by vendors along the streets in Phnom Penh. A social enterpise, they work with many underprivileged people who either serve as hosts or facilitators. The facilitators will pick you up from your hotel and translate for you. These facilitators are usually young students looking for work to pay for their education or orphans looking to transition into society. Transport is provided for most activities in Phnom Penh. A great way to interact with local people and take in the culture and have something memorable to bring home."
"Phoceamekong Cruises operates river cruises from Phnom Penh. The trips are ""all-inclusive,"" but their website notes that they actually do not include ""personal expenses, tips, and other services not mentioned."""
"The Cambodian riel is not used for large purchases. Prices for anything more substantial than a plate of rice will be quoted in US dollars. The Cambodian Central Bank maintains the riel at approximately 3,900–4,100 to the dollar. Be wary if rates are outside this range. Money changers are plentiful near the central market and display their rates on boards.  Only up market places will accept plastic (normally with a 3% surcharge). Changing dollars into riel is generally unnecessary, though the parsimonious will notice a small benefit. Small purchases with notes above USD20 can cause problems, though vendors will manage. Do not worry if a vendor runs off with your large note, they are finding change not robbing you. Torn, damaged, or old series US currency may not be accepted.  There are plenty of ATMs. They dispense US dollars and accept international cards. Canadia Bank and Mekong Bank ATMs were fee-free but no longer as of the end of 2014. MB Bank (St 93 cnr St 214) doesn't charge and allows up to $1,000 withdrawal (July 2016).  Maybank also doesn't charge, but it accepts only Visa cards. Otherwise typical charges are $5 regardless of amount withdrawn, typically $500 is the maximum. Both ANZ Royal bank and Canadia bank charge USD5 per transaction, max single withdrawal $500. For safety reasons, it's a good idea to use ATMs at actual bank branches when they are open so any problems can immediately be reported and there is often a security guard on duty too. It also gives the opportunity to ask for smaller notes, such as 20s or 10s which are much easier to spend and get change back from and little risk of picking up counterfeit notes . The Mekong Bank at 220 Sisowath Quay are happy to change big notes to smaller ones or change damaged notes.  Cashing traveller's cheques can be problematic. Even major banks may refuse to exchange traveller's cheques above USD100."
"If you like dollar, euro or pound shops then you will enjoy the Cambodian versions, which are even cheaper at 2500 riel. They are also sometimes called 1000 or 1500 riel shops. There is a good one near the main entrance of Sorya Mall on St 51."
"Japanese almost $2 shop. Full of different kinds of items. Similar shops can be found Aeon Mall."
"Phnom Penh is a good place to get visas for neighbouring countries Vietnam and Thailand as well as for China. You can get these visas by going directly to the embassies, but that will take two visits, time filling in forms, potentially a lot of waiting and transport costs. For a few dollars extra a visa agent can be well worth it. Visas for Indonesia can only be obtained from the Indonesian Embassy."
"Get your bus tickets and visas from this helpful and trusted green coloured travel agent. They also rent bicycles for $2/day."
"Antiques, art, and curios from Cambodia's past and nearby SE Asian cultures."

"Has the most extensive collection of new books in Phnom Penh, including fiction and non-fiction, children's books, non-English-language works (in French and Khmer, for instance), magazines and newspapers. There is a particularly good collection of books from and about Cambodia, for instance, on Angkor Wat, the Khmer Rouge regime, and the history of Cambodia. Prices can be very high, often above the list price, and can be purchased cheaper elsewhere in town. However, you can also get a good tea or coffee and cake there, if the serving staff are awake and it's a nice place to sip and read without being pestered. Monument Toys upstairs has a collection of children's toys and games. There is a branch of the bookshop at the airport."
"Features some of the finest Angkorian art anywhere, including the remarkable statue of the Leper King. And if you've heard the disturbing rumors, fear not: the infamous bat colony moved out after the 2002 renovation, so you no longer need to carry an umbrella when touring the exhibits inside! Has a small selection of books on Cambodian archaeology, art, culture, and history. Remember that money you spend at any Cambodian government-run institution will end up in officials' pockets."
"Good custom-made shoes."
"Stock bargain priced clothes and large sizes."
"Cambodia is a cheap place to buy a MacBook, iPad or iPod: prices are in US dollars are similar to elsewhere, but without added tax. iPhones are available only by special import and from licensed Apple agents and so are not cheap. The best Mac retailer and repairer is '''Uniyoung''' near the Central Market."
"Cheap and decent Android phones and Bluetooth speakers."
"Cambodia is a cheap place to buy Samsung phones as there is no sales tax, but it's best to buy from one of only two authorised dealers in Phnom Penh. One near Central Market and the other on Monivong Blvd. Note that Samsung one year guarantees are only valid in the country where you buy, unlike Apple that honours warranties worldwide."
"Handmade silk goods, jewellery, accessories and clothing made by women disabled from polio and land mines. If you ask, you will also be able to tour the shop, meeting the female workers and seeing where they study English. The products are absolutely beautiful and the majority of the silk is sourced from a local village, where it is all hand woven. The costs of running the project are covered by selling the artists' work in the shop. They receive no grants or aid."
"Specializes in handicrafts from around the country."
"Has a wide range of Cambodian silk products, including a wide range of ladies' handbags at a fraction of the price you would pay in a hotel gift shop."
"Features brightly-colored fun and funky paintings of Cambodian life - a welcome relief after visiting some of Cambodia's more heart-breaking attractions. This features some very famous ""happy monk"" paintings which you will see a lot around Phnom Penh."
"The ""New Market"" is a 1930s art Deco covered market near the Riverfront (Sisowath Quay) district. The market is well laid out, and sells everything from flowers to video games. It has recently been beautifully renovated and its architecture alone is worth admiring."
"Good for cheap local food with many food stalls. Usually some live entertainment, but is primarily for the locals."
"The newest and biggest Western-style mall in Phnom Penh. The mall contains a large branch of Lucky Supermarket, as well as many fast food outlets and modern shops, mainly catering to Phnom Penh's growing middle-class."
"Olympic Market was built in 1994 and is a local favourite with shoppers looking for wholesale fabrics, everyday wear, religious paraphernalia and traditional Khmer dresses. Buyers can look forward to big discounts in this market especially if they are buying in bulk. The market is well laid out and is one of the more modern multi-story market complexes. Buyers should definitely give this market a visit."
"The Russian Market moniker dates to the Vietnamese occupation of the city in the 1980s. Real designer clothes at discount prices. A lot of the factories for Levis, CK, Ralph Lauren and many other brands are in Phnom Penh; however, a lot of the clothes sold here are deemed unfit to be shipped abroad due to very small faults and, therefore are sold at this market. You can also purchase fake Swiss watches and pirated software at low prices. It's located away from normal tourist areas, but motodop drivers who cater to tourists will know it."
"Phnom Penh's main Western-style mall, is nearby. Sorya is rather drab by Western standards, and is crowded with stalls (like a traditional market, a strange juxtaposition). It is air conditioned and contains a range of cheap fast food outlets as well as the well-stocked Lucky Supermarket. Don't leave a motorbike with the Sorya parking people, who are known to steal helmets and double the parking charges on a whim."
"Probably Phnom Penh's most modern shopping mall (opened mid 2014) with many brand name and Japanese stores. Also has many restaurants and 7 screen [http://www.majorcineplex.com.kh/cinema/showtimes Major Cineplex Cinema]."

"This Phnom Penh institution is in a renovated colonial building and its second-floor terrace offers sweeping views over the river, a Khmer-Western menu and a list of signature cocktails ($5.50): try the Tonle Sap Breezer or the Burmese Rum Sour. The decor and feel captures the eventful past of the city. The bar is open until midnight and a very popular nightspot on weekends. All that said, while famous and definitely worth a visit, it's pricy compared to most of the competition and service and timing tend to be haphazard. No air-con and rather spoiled by the unseemly gauntlet of touts one has to battle through to leave. FCC does particularly good desserts."

While not quite as popular as the Timbers, they're still the only NWSL team to draw over 10,000 per game in any of the league's first three seasons (doing so all three seasons). In 2015, they averaged slightly over 15,000 per home game, far higher than any other professional women's team in the U.S. and rivaled only by the University of Utah gymnastics team in all U.S. women's sports."

"A large ballroom with cash bar featuring many of Portland's favorite music artists and national touring acts."
"Roseland Theater is a great place to go see a rock show or catch a hip hop concert. It is a good size venue but still gives you that crowded rock show feel. This venue is very fun to watch a show because the crowd always gets really into the music. It gets very crowded in some parts of the theater. This theater is standing room only. However there are seats in the upstairs to view the show from there."
"Crystal Ballroom often referred to as ""The Crystal"" is one of the nicest venues in town. The Ballroom is great size and has great art and period light fixtures. This is a clean, well maintained venue. The Crystal has a bar inside with upstairs balcony seating for 21+. The main floor is standing room only which makes the show much more intense. The floor gives under the weight of the crowd and can ""bounce"" if the crowd decides to jump in unison (to bring on an encore, for example). According the Crystal's website, at the time of its construction, the Crystal's mechanical dance floor (now fully restored to proper working order) was said to be unique on the Pacific Coast. Today, it may be the only one left in the United States."

"Taqueria. Slightly larger menu than the other locations."
Taqueria.
Taqueria.
"A distinctly Portland spot, where you can get unusual donuts and a marriage while learning Swahili. While they do have the standard cake doughnuts, the real stars are the doughnuts topped with cereal, candy bars, strawberry Quik powder, and the maple bar with bacon (yes, bacon) on it. It's also the place to get vegan doughnuts. While the vibe is cool and flavour combinations and the naming gimmicks are creative, the doughnuts themselves are not that great. They tend to be a bit heavy and often lacking in freshness, and the cereal toppings are often soggy. If you want a sugar rush and possibly a free huge doughnut, take the Tex-Ass Challenge; eat one of their oversized glazed doughnuts in under a minute and a half and it's free. (Of course, you have to purchase it in advance!) Lines are frequently long and wrap around the block, with wait times up to two hours."

"One of Portland's finest brewpub/restaurant combos, serving everything from steak to vegan platters and the menu changes quite frequently."

"Serves delicious Chinese food and is open fairly late."

"Portland’s oldest restaurant, open since 1879, this place is known for its turkey dinners and Spanish coffees, poured right at your table."
"Serves up a mean corned beef sandwich, better than most you'll get on the West Coast, not to mention their famous bagels. Outside tables in the summertime add to the pleasure."
"Excellent thin-crust pizza; try the faux-Italian options."
"Another place with excellent thin-crust pizza. Get any of the surprisingly good veggie pizza toppings, like artichoke."
"Great food and the atmosphere is wonderful, with the guests sitting on long, ornately decorated couches or on huge pillows on the floor and Moroccan tapestries hanging on the walls. They also make sure you get your money's worth as $18.50 buys a five-course meal."

"Authentic German cuisine, including bratwurst, schintzel, spaetzle and sauerbraten. Many German beers on tap."

"Has now expanded across the US, but ""way back when"" it was just a Portland seafood restaurant. They still serve fresh seafood, too, and it's excellent almost any way they prepare it."
"If you like dessert, this is the place to go. Although the entrees aren't all that impressive, sometimes there are four different lemon desserts, not to mention a wide selection of chocolates of every kind."
"Wonderfully inventive, delicious cuisine served in a lovely setting, with a view of the park blocks."
"Both an excellent location near several movie theaters and the shopping district and solid Italian-Pacific Northwest fusion cuisine. It gets quite crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, however, so be forewarned."
"This expensive, lavish restaurant has been made into one of the most romantic spots in Portland. If you are lucky enough to get a table or smart to reserve a table next to a window, you can enjoy your meal overlooking the great city of Portland. The menu offers only the finest selection of steak and seafood and you get as good as you pay. Lunch, however, is not as expensive and offers the same wonderful view and good food. Happy Hour is even cheaper (4:30-6:30PM) for the same good food, but much more crowded than lunchtime."

"Offers 20 constantly rotating taps, plus one beer engine, encompassing the entire range of beer styles with emphasis on Oregon breweries. Located in downtown Portland, convenient to most hotels, mass transit, events, nightlife, restaurants and welcome to both microbrew fanatics and the uninitiated. One of the most eclectic selections of beer around and encourages enthusiasm for the unfamiliar."
"Shows a great assortment of esoteric films and the world's longest running Rocky Horror Picture Show."
"A funky night spot with great bar food."
"Cool building and great atmosphere. Hanging swing chairs, heated patio and downstairs bar with skee ball. The food is higher end, but not pricey and full bar with big wine list and great beers on tap make this spot a local favorite."

Originally not a brewpub, a recent relocation closer to the Willamette River has added a taproom (W-Su 2PM-8PM), and its beers can also be found around town at such places as Higgins and the Horse Brass."
"One of the newest additions to the Portland brewpub scene. They emphasize sustainable practices business model. Hoppy beer with a distinct flavor."
"Another English-style pub that also serves a range of English-style food. An ""old-world"" atmosphere, reasonable prices, an huge beer list, free darts, and a friendly and knowledgeable staff make this a great place to relax with a pint and catch up with old friends."
"For the quintessential Portland brewpub experience. Enjoy beer crafted by award-winning Brewmaster Christian Ettinger along with excellent food in a family-friendly setting. The garlic fries are not to be missed, desserts are huge and appealing, and the Laurelwood Spinach Salad is the best salad in Portland. Very child-friendly, so be aware of unsupervised toddlers darting around between the tables. Entrees are creative and of high quality."
"Opening with its original location in 1983, The Barley Mill Pub, McMenamins now boasts over 50 locations in Oregon and Washington, which include the Bagdad Theater and Pub, '''Mission Theater and Pub''' at 1624 NW Glisan St, and the '''Kennedy School Theater''' at 5736 NE 33rd Ave. Not all locations have theaters."
"A non-chain, non-McMenamins owned cinema brew pub showing more foreign, documentary and experimental film."
"Another cinema serving beer, wine and food. Children are allowed to shows before 5:30PM; after that it's 21+ only."
"Best burger and fries downtown, and more beers than you can handle."
"One of the more upscale, inventive cocktail spots in PDX. The great drink concoctions have been written about in many national publications."
"Kava kava is a mildly sedating drink from the South Pacific. Definitely worth a try if you're in Portland since the South Pacific is quite far away. Great place to relax and socialize in a semi-authentic atmosphere, all the while trying something entirely new and exotic."
"Now available only at a small handful of locations inside Portland International Airport, it used to be Portland's answer to Starbucks' empire, except with real milkshakes, and better coffee. Try a Velvet Hammer if you need caffeine."
"A great coffee house in Portland. No other place like it. If you visit for the summer, you must come to this place. It's a great experience."
"Great, hard-core coffee roaster where craft is more important than flash. This small coffee shop roasts its own coffee in a visible back room. Be sure to take some home as there are not many places that do such a good job with their roasting. Free Wi-Fi on site."
"One of the most celebrated and appreciated local coffee roasters in a city known for good coffee, Stumptown is credited for having beans that taste as fresh as a good home roast. Frequent customers include a quirky assortment of hipsters, yuppies, artists and the like. Many other coffee shops around town sell exclusively Stumptown coffee, and beans can be purchased whole at any of the five locations, as well as more gourmet grocery stores such as Wild Oats and Whole Foods."
"A loft style cafe and coffee roastery."
"Great locally owned company whose on-site coffee roasting has won awards. Serves organic, sustainable coffees in a great and comfortable atmosphere. One of the best coffee shops in Portland."
"A lovely and clean hostel in a couple of pleasant old buildings. Kitchen, internet access, and the staff are very friendly and relaxed. You can't beat the location for the price; a fairly quiet side street in a nice neighborhood near downtown."
"Complimentary WiFi access, PDX airport shuttle services."
"Located in the southwest part of the city, one block from a beautiful park on the Willamette River."
"Free daily breakfast and high speed internet access."
"Boutique all-suite hotel with modern decor, a rooftop deck, and kitchens."
"Crisp, modern guest rooms, cutting edge entertainment, food 21/7, and spa style rub-downs make up this unique boutique hotel. While there, The Doug Fir is not to be missed. All day eats and drinks. Often has loaner bicycles."
"A decommissioned elementary school converted into a hotel by the McMenamins's group who also have several other converted buildings in the Portland area. Each room was made from one-half of an old classroom with items like blackboards, coatrooms, and so on still in place. The hotel has a full restaurant with its own bar and large outdoor patio. Be sure to try the Cajun Tater Tots! There's also a second-run movie theater (free with hotel stay) with a bar/cafe and table service. Also on site are the Concordia Microbrewery, Detention Bar (smoking allowed), Honor's Bar (non-smoking), Cypress Room (smoking allowed), and an outdoor soaking pool. Free Wi-Fi and great artwork throughout."
"Apartment-like suites with kitchens (stove, refrigerator, coffee-maker, and dishwasher). Rooms also include a living room and comfortable beds. It's a short bus ride on the 15 to downtown. Rates are reasonable."
"A beautifully detailed 1892 Victorian. Huge king room, single room and very large bath. Amenities include gourmet coffee, fluffy robes, private entrance, microwave, mini-fridge, Dr. Hauscka bath products, luxury spa across the street."
"A grand historic 1912 hotel located downtown."
"Conveniently located at the entrance to the Portland International Airport."
"Convenient to downtown and MAX train stops."
"Luxury hotel with free daily wine tasting in the lobby."
"Historic four star hotel."
"Stylish boutique hotel in downtown."
"Bed and breakfast in an elegant 1906 Queen Anne house in the Irvington Historic District."
"A less-flashy, but highly dignified entry in Portland's hotel market, the Mark Spencer receives excellent reviews. Its arts theme is well served by its location near the junction of the West End, Pearl District, Northwest District, and Downtown neighborhoods."
"A grand boutique 4-star hotel located in the upper floors of historic Meier Frank Plaza building in a central part of the downtown core. Macy's is in the first five floors accessed from SW Alder (north side of the building) while the Nines occupy the 6th through the 15th floors accessed from SW Morrison."
"24-hour complimentary shuttle service to Portland International Airport. Complimentary high speed Internet access."
"Four star hotel overlooking the river."
"Issues one-hour guest passes for Internet terminal use. Numerous branch libraries scattered around Portland. Free wi-fi available to public while the libraries are open. Wi-fi shuts off ten minutes before the libraries close and stays off until the library opens again."
"Zip codes for the greater Portland area typically range 97201 through 97266. There are also other zip codes in the surrounding cities making up the greater Portland metropolitan area ranging from 970xx to 971xx as well. There are numerous post office branches in different neighborhoods and at least one (or more) in each adjacent city/municipality serving the other zip codes."
"Nationally recognized, Pulitzer Prize–winning broadsheet newspaper known for cutting-edge design (which has declined in recent years) and local-oriented coverage (the paper is distributed throughout the state and into Vancouver, Washington). The paper suffers as a city guide for the out-of-towner as its arts coverage is limited (Friday A&E is comprehensive), but for those interested in longer stays it is a good primer on state politics. Movie times are up to date, However the printed television schedule has been discontinued."
"An alternative weekly newspaper that recently won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigative reporting. This boomer-hipster hybrid sometimes struggles from identity freak-out but is likely the quickest and most immediate help to out-of-towners. The paper's free annual city guide ""Finder"" can be found around town in late August and is specifically tailored for those new to Portland. ''Willamette Week'' is sometimes referred to as ''Willy Week'' or ''Willy'' by old-guard Portland hipsters or those who disagree with its politics."
"Portland's queer newspaper. It started in 2012 when ''Just Out'', Portland's established LGBT publication for three decades, went out of business (although ''Just Out'' shortly resumed publication under new ownership). ''PQ Monthly'' covers the full diversity of the Portland queer community. Consult ''PQ'' to find community events of interest to LGBT people, or to find the gay nightlife. Every third Thursday, the paper's staff hosts a press party at a local queer venue, where the newest issue can be picked up hot off the presses. This is a great opportunity to get acquainted with LGBT Portland."
"This broadsheet-sized upstart has struggled since its start to find a spot between ''Willamette Week'' and ''The Oregonian'', the city's mainstays and the paper's main competitors. Suburbanites who work in the city tend to favor the ''Tribune''."
"Another alt weekly newspaper, the Portland version of Seattle's ''The Stranger''. This tabloid-sized hipster-focused mag has taken a bite out of ''Willamette Week'''s advertising in recent years, meaning that those looking for movie times or rock show listings can often find them in the ''Mercury'''s pages. Readers offended by foul language or grammatical errors may be frustrated by the editorial content."
"The waterfall is 620 ft (189 m) high and features a paved trail to the top for those willing to make the trek. The view is worth it. For a scenic drive, travel east 15 miles on Interstate 84 to exit 18, take the Historic Columbia River Highway 9 mi (15 km) to the turnoff for Larch Mountain, go 14 mi (23 km) up East Larch Mountain Road to parking lot, short walk to Sherrard Point for viewpoint, drive back to the highway, then continue about a mile to Crown Point, then 9 miles to Multnomah Falls. There are a number of smaller falls along the way, which freeze in the winter. To get back to Interstate 84 continue east to the next freeway entrance."
"25 mi (40 km) or so southwest of Portland lies some of the most scenic vineyards on the west coast. There are over 100 wineries in this area, from small mom and pop operations with tiny one-room tasting areas all the way up to tasting rooms that rival some of Napa's finest. Oregon is particularly famous for its Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris varietals; the climate is considered perfect for these grapes and the area has gained world wide note as one of the premier wine regions on the planet."
"Pearson Field, the oldest continuous operating air field in the U.S., is now a museum with beautifully restored southern houses used by many well known people such as General George Marshall. You can walk for hours from the Officers Row to Pearson Airfield to Fort Vancouver and down to the Columbia River, passing the oldest apple tree in Washington State."
"The official visitor's association for the Greater Rochester area.  In addition to English, brochures are available in eight foreign languages: Chinese (simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.  VisitRochester has information centers in the following locations:"
"This is the main office for VisitRochester."
"Although only staffed during the listed hours, the booth's brochures can be picked up anytime."
"Focuses on downtown information.  Keep an eye out for red-shirted Downtown Safety Services team members on bike or on foot; they roam downtown and can help you with any problems you have."
"Located at the confluence of the Genesee River and the Erie Canal, the park is a great place to step off onto the Genesee Riverway Trail, the Genesee Valley Greenway, and the Erie Canalway Trail (see below)."
"Most famous for its hundreds of lilacs, Highland Park is the site of the annual '''Lilac Festival'''. Even when the lilacs aren't blooming, though, there are countless other examples of Rochester's horticultural tradition. There is a Sunken Garden behind the Warner Castle, and the Highland Park Bowl, a natural amphitheater, hosts concerts and films during the summer. The park also hosts the county's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the AIDS Remembrance Garden."
"The conservatory holds a number of more exotic plants that wouldn't survive outside in Rochester, including desert and tropical species. Open year-round and a wonderful refuge from the stark winter landscapes."
"Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony and other historic figures are buried in this beautiful Victorian cemetery. Also a great place for running. Guided tours are available periodically throughout the year; the Halloween tour is particularly popular."
"A non-profit organization housed in a huge warehouse, Artisan Works comprises a labyrinth of hallways and levels where every square inch is covered with art in all media (but mostly painting and sculpture). Everything is for sale. The gallery provides studio space to dozens of artists, some of whom may be working when you visit, and all of whom are happy to chat about what they're making. Also within is the Triangle Theater, a 30-seat movie theater which features films by student and local filmmakers."
"If, when you get to the lighthouse, you wonder where the shore is, it's half a mile northeast. That's how much land has been added to the northern shore of New York since the lighthouse was built in 1822. Museum on the first floor has a lot of displays on Rochester's harbor history."
"A small gallery operated by RIT students, featuring the work of fine art students and other artists of note."
"The world's oldest photography museum, the George Eastman Museum could really be considered three museums in one. First, and most visible, is the George Eastman House, the mansion built by the founder of Eastman Kodak, restored to appear much as it did when he was alive, illustrating the life of Rochester's elite in the early twentieth century. Second, the museum hosts regular rotating exhibits highlighting the history of photography and film. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the museum houses an enormous archive of photographs, film, and related technology, among the largest in the world. Other institutions regularly send film here for conservation. Guided tours of the house are available, and the exhibits can be toured at your own pace, but access to the archives is restricted to serious researchers only. Films are presented regularly in the museum's Dryden Theatre (see below)."
"A gallery devoted to photography with a new show every four weeks. If a work strikes your fancy, feel free to purchase it!"
"The premier art museum in the area, with over 12,000 items, from artists both obscure and renowned. A real Baroque Italian organ resides inside. The Centennial Sculpture Park on the grounds is open 24/7."
"Several different collections, for both exhibition and research, are combined here to document the public health of Rochester and Monroe County."
"A science museum filled with hands-on exhibits and activities. Fantastic for kids, but a lot of it is fun for parents, too. Kids will love the Adventure Zone, full of active and creative play opportunities. Don't miss the enormous mastodon skeleton in Expedition Earth, or the musical Tesla coils in Electricity Theater. Other permanent exhibits focus on the people of the Haudenosaunee, nineteenth-century Rochester, the Underground Railroad, and more. The Strasenburgh Planetarium is next door."
"The planetarium adjacent to the RMSC offers a variety of large-format films and weekly planetarium shows using their state-of-the-art star projector. Saturdays during the summer feature laser-light shows set to music. Show times vary."
"Rochester's zoo is nestled inside the Olmsted-designed Seneca Park. While small&mdash;the entire zoo can easily be enjoyed in an afternoon&mdash;a lot of value is packed into the small area. Genny C and Lilac are the only African elephants in the state; the zoo's three orangutans are also unique in New York. The Rocky Coasts exhibit, with polar bears, sea lions, and penguins, is a definite highlight."
"Enjoy live music, drink beer and wine, socialize, and enjoy other activities among the animals of the zoo. Ages 21 and up only."
"The oldest remaining building in Monroe County, parts of which were built as early as 1792. The house later served as a tavern for travelers along East Avenue; it's now been restored and serves as an excellent example of the era."
"This downtown children's museum, the only one in the world with a specific focus on play, is ''the'' place to visit if you have kids from 1-12. You can easily spend a whole day here, or visit a couple of times to enjoy everything. This museum focuses on learning through play and features tons of interactive exhibits, including some focused on well-known themes like '''Sesame Street'''. One nice feature is that most exhibits have information for adults to read (such as on how fairy tales have changed with the times) while the kids do things like climb on a pirate ship. Older visitors (those who can remember the 80s) may also enjoy the classic arcade cabinets in the '''eGameRevolution''' exhibit. The Strong is also home to the '''National Toy Hall of Fame'''; the associated toy archives are less interactive but might bring back a lot of memories for older visitors. The museum's '''Dancing Wings Butterfly Garden''' costs $3 extra and has a limited number of timed tickets available each day."
"This is the house where the women's rights activist lived for many years, and where she was arrested after voting illegally in 1872. The museum highlights Anthony's influences, the many reforms she worked for (suffrage, abolition, temperance, education, and a purse of her own among them), her friendship with Frederick Douglass, and her trial for voting."
"Public art came to Rochester in a (literally) huge way in 2012, in which Wall\Therapy invited urban artists from all across the globe to come and use the city's blank walls as canvases. It started in the Public Market neighborhood, then in 2013 moved to El Camino and the South Wedge. No admission needed; just stroll around and gawk. It's rapidly becoming a major event in the street-artist community, so look for it to continue in the years ahead."
"One should not miss a drive down historic East Ave; with the mansions of Rochester's past barons still mostly intact, you can really see a history lesson of the Rochester area. Another great place to see off of East Ave is the Sandringham/Ambassador Drive neighborhood; some of the greatest residential architecture in Rochester can be viewed here."
"Most famous for its annual Corn Hill Arts Festival, this area can be nice to walk around any time of the year. As Rochester's oldest residential neighborhood, there are lots of beautiful historic homes. Corn Hill Landing, on the river, has shops and restaurants."
"Small residential neighborhood in downtown Rochester. Full of beautiful 19th century townhouses. Several good restaurants are in the neighborhood and it is in easy walking distance to Eastman Theater and the Eastman School of Music as well as the Memorial Art Gallery."
"The majestic High Falls of the Genesee are what attracted settlers to the area in the first place. A 96-foot (29&nbsp;m) waterfall in the center of downtown is certainly a unique sight; viewing is best from the Pont de Rennes pedestrian bridge. But also take a walk around the old warehouses on the west bank between the bridge and the falls; this is the area known as ""High Falls"" and home to a very nice museum/visitor's center and some very old milling equipment."
"This visitor's center focuses on High Falls but has information on the whole city as well. Also features a small museum with rotating exhibits, a gift shop, and walking tours of the High Falls area and other historic neighborhoods (call ahead)."
"An eclectic neighborhood along University Avenue, near the Village Gate and the Rochester Museum and Science Center. Lots of public artwork (thanks to '''[http://www.rochesterartwalk.org/ ArtWalk]'''), some small shops and eateries, and beautiful Victorian homes. Very walkable."
"There are a lot of great trendy shops in this district, and it's serviced by the RTS service. However, it's definitely not an entire day activity, and things close relatively early."
"A triangular neighborhood bordered by the Genesee and Interstate 490. The South Wedge is what some may call an ""up and coming"" neighborhood. Many nightlife options and a growing number of shops and businesses. Located close to Alexander street as well as the University of Rochester and Mt. Hope Cemetery."
"Rochester Institute of Technology's innovation and creativity festival showcases what happens ""when the left brain and right brain collide,"" featuring hundreds of student projects from every corner of the university. Robotics, music, sign language, virtual reality, ecology, and weird science are just a few of the many subject areas covered; in fact, most of the projects take elements from multiple disciplines and combine them in innovative ways. Plenty of food, hands-on exhibits, and kids' activities make for an unbeatable value for a day out."
"For ten days every May, Rochester's flagship festival celebrates the community&mdash;and its flowers&mdash;in beautiful Highland Park, designed by renowned landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted. The park's world-famous lilac collection was started by horticulturist John Dunbar in 1892 with 20 varieties. Today, over 500 varieties of lilacs cover 22 of Highland Park's 155 acres. The usual summer festival staples are all here, such as kiddie rides and food vendors, but also tons of activities for kids, a parade, a craft show, a festival-sponsored 5K race, and a packed schedule of music and entertainment. You can even buy [http://www.highlandlilac.com Highland Lilac perfume]!"
"Modern and classic cocktails are making a comeback, even in often-staid Rochester. Starting in 2014, Rochester's bars and bartenders have gotten together to share cocktail culture, ideas, and recipes with each other and with the general public. Six days of events at venues throughout the city."
"After six years at Ontario Beach Park, this annual BBQ competition moved to the roomier Genesee Valley Park in 2014. They still have plenty of music and kids activities surrounding the competition. Lots of food available, too (most of it barbecued or grilled), although you won't be sampling the competition dishes. New in 2014 were a Food Truck Throwdown and a Kids' Q competition."
"They may not be the lilacs of Highland Park, but Maplewood Park's rose garden is impressive in its own right. This is also a great opportunity to take a tour of the Genesee River gorge near the park."
"Founded in 2002, this is already one of the largest music festivals in North America. Held in 19 venues, all within walking distance of each other, the nine-day festival offers a mix of free and ticketed events for people of all ages. It attracts fans from the U.S. and around the world who come to hear one of the most multidimensional, international, and diverse artist lineups presented at a major music festival."
"The Corn Hill neighborhood, with some of the city's oldest and prettiest homes, is just south of downtown along the river. This festival celebrates the neighborhood's long history with over 400 arts and crafts exhibitors, plus the standard live musicians and food vendors."
"Park Avenue is already one of the most eclectic neighborhoods of the city, and this festival just cements that. Almost the entire length of the street (more than a mile!) will be packed with people browsing artisans' wares, eating great food, visiting the local stores and restaurants, and listening to some music. This one may be the most popular of the summer arts festivals."
"Many years ago, Clarissa Street was known as ""Rochester's Broadway"", home to the best jazz clubs in the city. Urban renewal in the 60s and 70s left its unfortunate mark on this neighborhood, but every August people come back for one day to celebrate the place it used to be. Live music is the main draw, but you'll also find a parade and other typical festival fare."
"This is the most ""artsy"" of the summer festivals, focused on paintings and other artwork more so than the crafts of other festivals. You can also take this opportunity to browse the gallery itself."
"Organizers of this festival hoped to attract 15,000 attendees when it started in 2012; they got 33,000... and 50,000 the next year. The festival features a wide-ranging slate of artistic performances, from theater to dance and music, at venues throughout the East End... including a magnificent and rare Spiegeltent from Germany. This was the first Fringe Festival in Upstate New York, and it's been an unqualified success."
"Rochester has a number of ethnic festivals throughout the year, but this one, celebrating German culture, is certainly the biggest. The music presented here might be the best you'll find at any other local festival outside of the Jazz Festival. And if you like bratwurst and sauerkraut&mdash;or a good German lager&mdash;you can't beat Oktoberfest."
"Rochester celebrates the Genesee River with this full weekend of events taking place all along the river. The Head of the Genesee Regatta, a two-day series of rowing races on the upper river near the canal, could be considered the centerpiece, but there are plenty other family-friendly things to see and do."
"Films and videos of all types, but all having something to do with gender and sexuality, are on tap for these ten days in October at multiple venues around the city."
"Rochester is not known for its role in the world of fashion, but one group has dedicated themselves to showing that fashion touches everyone's lives. With affordable ticket prices, accessible events, and a sense of fun and charity, Fashion Week goes all over the city to bring fashion to the masses. It's becoming a big event around town, with boutique crawls, fun parties, and of course runway shows."
"It may not be Cannes, or even Toronto, but Rochester's annual film festival has its own niche and charm. Appropriately for the home of both George Eastman and Susan B. Anthony, Rochester's film festival focuses on the achievements of female filmmakers and actresses and each year awards The Susan B. Anthony ""Failure is Impossible"" Award. Most of the films are shown at the historic Little Theatre on East Avenue; others are at the Dryden Theatre at the Eastman House."
"A Rochester tradition since 1899, the Red Wings are the AAA affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. Frontier Field is a beautiful ballpark situated downtown with convenient $6 parking. On the 4th of July and certain other summer nights, there are free fireworks shows with admission. Your food options are a bit better than the average&mdash;there's the usual hot dogs and beer (white hots and Genny, since this is Rochester, after all), but maybe you'd like to try the Red Osier roast beef sandwiches, chicken French, fried calamari, or the ""Home Plate"" (Frontier Field's take on the Garbage Plate)."
"Known fondly as the ""Amerks"", Rochester's storied hockey team is the AHL affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres. The Blue Cross Arena at the Rochester War Memorial is an old building, but it was renovated in the 90s and is now a fine downtown hockey arena. One of the oldest and most successful teams in the league, the Amerks are working to overcome recent struggles, but hockey night in Rochester is still a fun time."
"The Rhinos are in the United Soccer League, a second- or third-tier soccer league in the U.S. They play at soccer-specific Rhinos Stadium less than a mile northwest of Frontier Field, and there's not a bad seat in the house. Food options are not quite as good as at the baseball stadium, but has improved in recent years thanks to some local partnerships."
"The K-Hawks are a top-tier indoor lacrosse team, featuring some of the best talent in the world. If you've never seen an indoor lacrosse match, a National Lacrosse League game is a great introduction. With back-to-back-to-back NLL championships (2012&ndash;14) and several future Hall-of-Famers on the roster, the K-Hawks have established a true sports dynasty. You simply won't find better, more exciting lacrosse being played anywhere. (And if the opponent is Buffalo or Toronto, you're in for a ''real'' treat!)"
"The outdoor-lacrosse Rattlers haven't had as much success as the indoor Knighthawks, and there's not much overlap in the rosters, but they're still a major league team featuring some of the best players in the world. They play at Aquinas Stadium on the campus of a local private high school."
"The Razorsharks, in the Premier Basketball League, are the latest in a long line of successful basketball teams in Rochester. With four championships in just seven seasons, they're one of the top minor-league teams in the country."
"Charter members of the National Women's Soccer League, the Flash also play at Rhinos Stadium. They won three championships in three different leagues from 2010 to 2012, and nearly won a fourth in 2013. They won the semi-pro W-League as the Buffalo Flash in 2010, the final Women's Professional Soccer championship in 2011, and the Women's Premier Soccer League Elite championship in 2012, but lost the NWSL's inaugural championship game in 2013."
"Who needs football? Rochester Institute of Technology has hockey! Rochester's only Division I college teams play a hard-hitting and very successful brand of hockey, and they've already made waves in just a short time at the top level, including a Frozen Four appearance for the men in 2010. The brand-new Gene Polisseni Center on campus will try to replicate the old-school atmosphere of the Tigers' previous barn while providing plenty of modern amenities. The legendary Corner Crew cheering section harasses opposing goalies all night, every night. This classic college hockey atmosphere is worth experiencing."
"The closest the Rochester area gets to major-league team sports is the Bills' annual summer training camp, held since 2000 in northern Pittsford. There's lots to do besides just watch practices, too; you can participate in interactive games, peruse the merchandise, or try to get some autographs. You can get a lot closer to the players here than at the stadium in Buffalo!"
"Rochester's oldest neighborhood movie theater. Always a double feature (both second-run), with a mix of foreign/indie and standard Hollywood fare, this theater also has a resident cat who sometimes will sit on your lap during the show."
"Second-run theater showing mostly mainstream Hollywood films for a very low price."
"The Eastman House, a major not-for-profit film and photographic museum, houses the Dryden Theatre. The Dryden shows a wide variety of Hollywood classics, international and independent films -- literally something different every night of the week. The programming is thoughtful and cutting-edge, with frequent visits by directors and actors. Nearly all films begin at 8PM and are preceded by a brief film talk. Tickets $4-6, except during special events such as visiting filmmakers."
"Run by a not-for-profit corporation, the historic Little shows a wide variety of foreign, independent and classic films in five theatres. There is also a cafe bakery (serves a full dinner menu along with wine and beer), sometimes with live music."
"The University of Rochester's own student-run movie group. Movies are shown on Fridays and Saturdays, as well as most Thursdays while Fall and Spring semesters are in session. Movies of every conceivable genre are shown throughout the year, including pornography."
"The Auditorium Theatre is Rochester's Broadway roadhouse; the '''Rochester Broadway Theatre League''' brings to town several touring productions each year. The theater is aging and acoustically imperfect, but it's been kept up as well as can be expected, and it's the only area theater with the space to put on the big shows. Other concerts and performances dot the schedule throughout the year; see the web site for upcoming events."
"Blackfriars Theatre is a mid-sized professional theatre that has entertained audiences for almost 60 years, providing a local showcase for actors and actresses, theater artists and technicians who have chosen to make Rochester their home. They've just moved to a new space on East Main near the Auditorium Center and the Main Street Armory."
"A tiny theatre with seating just a few feet from the stage; great for a small group outing or a date. It's best to call beforehand to buy tickets and get directions, as some productions are housed in one of their three other locations. Their newest space is a relatively enormous 250-seat venue in Brighton (3450 Winton Pl)."
"The newly renovated Kodak Hall at the Eastman Theatre is the best place to catch the '''Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra''' (see below), one of the best mid-sized city orchestras in the country. It's by far the best large performance space in Rochester, with the expected variety of events going on all year."
"The Tony-award winning choreographer Garth Fagan has his own dance troupe in Rochester, his adopted hometown. When they're not touring the country, they put on a variety of performances around the city. Truly world-class dancers provide a show you can't match in any other city this size."
"Geva, the city's premiere local theater company, hosts a variety of productions on its two stages, housed in a converted armory! Most popular are its Christmas productions, which alternate between ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''A Christmas Story''. Discounts are available for students and seniors."
"Hochstein Performance Hall is part of Hochstein School of Music & Dance, which has served as a community center for Greater Rochester since 1920. Located in the heart of the city, the 857-seat elegantly renovated Performance Hall offers free recitals and performances regularly, including the long-running ""Live from Hochstein"" Broadcast and Concert Series."
"Kilbourn is one of the finest small concert halls in the world, and it serves as the primary performance space for Eastman School of Music students. As such, audiences are in for a treat, in the form of free recitals and concerts throughout the year, as elite music students exhibit their talents on stage."
"One of George Eastman's greatest legacies, the Rochester Philharmonic is an outstanding orchestra, especially for a city the size of Rochester. The RPO's main performance space is the '''Eastman Theatre''' (see above), but they get around town to other venues, especially in the summer. Pops conductor Jeff Tyzik, once Doc Severinsen's arranger for the Tonight Show Band, has taught the RPO to swing like few other professional orchestras can, but their classical chops are equally noteworthy."
"A wide variety of live music several nights out of the week. There is also a reasonably priced bar inside."
"George Eastman and Dr. Henry Durand donated their summer-cottage lakefront properties to the city in 1909, and the park is now a popular summer getaway for everyone. Its beach is open for swimming during the summer, and it's less often closed due to water conditions than Ontario Beach. Also has a golf course and other standard park amenities."
"Located at the northernmost reaches of the city, Ontario Beach is the most popular beach area in Rochester. Unfortunately, there's a persistent algae problem that lends a unique scent to the area and closes the beach to swimming fairly frequently. When conditions allow, swimming is open 11AM-7PM daily during the summer. If you can't go in the water, though, there are other things to do; in particular, the 1905 Dentzel carousel should not be missed."
"This 80-foot paddlewheeler recalls the heyday of the Mississippi riverboats. It docks at the Port of Rochester and cruises both up the river and out onto the lake. Lunch and dinner cruises available, including specialty packages. Fall foliage cruise in October."
"The Mary Jemison, run by Corn Hill Navigation, departs from and returns to Corn Hill Landing, just south of downtown. It takes a 90-minute cruise up the river to the canal and back, with historical information provided by an on-board narrator. Lunch and dinner cruises available."
"This not-quite-completed trail runs along the river, north from the canal, through downtown, and all the way to the lake. You'll get a good look at the gorge along the northern section, and it can be a nice way to get downtown if your legs (and shoes) are up to the task. One highlight is the wide boardwalk over the Turning Point basin a couple of miles south of the lake."
"This trail, which will eventually stretch across the state, is being created from the former Erie Canal towpath, where the mules would walk to tow the barges along. Though the walking paths are open year-round, the canal is drained, kept empty, and less scenic between November and May. During the winter time, however, the canal trail is virtually deserted, and provides an excellent place to snowshoe and cross-country ski."
"Formerly a railroad bed, this mostly gravel trail is perfect for off-road cycling/walking/running. It follows along the Genesee River, cutting through the rolling farmland south of Rochester. 50+ miles depending upon how far south they've developed the path."
"If you happen to be in the area, Cobb's Hill provides a great panoramic view of downtown. Located on the corner of Culver and Monroe, it is an easy walk from the cafes on Park Ave. Large duck pond, baseball diamond, tennis courts and a nice (although steep) trail to the top of the hill, where the reservoir is located."
"While one of the largest breweries in the country, Genesee had no visitor's facility until September 2012. Now it's up and running as Genny's comeback in its hometown continues. The Genesee Brew House is a visitor's center, brew pub, and gift shop rolled into one. Genesee beers are on tap, of course, but there's also a pilot brewery for small batches of experimental brews; you can try a flight of four beers for $2, a portion of which goes to charity. The visitor's center recounts the long history of beer in Rochester."
"This is the country's largest indoor rock-climbing establishment, quite popular with the area's college students. Great exercise and fun, too."
"At the junction of Irondequoit Bay and Lake Ontario, Seabreeze combines the features of an old-fashioned amusement park with the technology and thrills of a modern water park. The fourth-oldest amusement park in America. Has an original 1920s carousel with hand-carved horses. Don't miss the historic Jack Rabbit roller coaster, the fourth-oldest operating coaster in the ''world''."
"Three institutions housed in a single non-profit entity, the Genesee Center is focused on providing studio space and training for artists. The main attraction for visitors are the classes, which are held year-round and teach budding artists the finer points of photography, pottery, printing, and more. Classes tend to extend over several weeks, though, so they're most useful for long-term travellers. If you happen to already be an experienced artist and need studio space, you might consider buying a membership, starting as low as $25. Members can rent studio space on an hourly basis."
"If it's glass or metal, the AFC can teach you how to make it... with fire. Welding, smithing, glass-shaping... it's all here. Though they also offer classes for pros, amateurs can have fun with the flames too. They even cater to couples, with frequent date-night specials."
"Looking for a quick infusion of knowledge? Or maybe you have something to teach the fine residents of Rochester? Either way, the Brainery is the place to go, as they provide classroom space for teachers to teach just about anything, from cat care to computer graphics. Most classes take up just a single evening session. Their offerings change constantly, so check back often."
"Established in 1905, the public market features over 300 stalls where independent sellers ply their wares, from cheap locally grown produce to handmade crafts and other curiosities. Great fun to just walk around, but good luck getting out without buying anything. Often overlooked by locals, yet always super-crowded; get there early for the best selection, or late for the best prices."
"Books, gifts, and artwork with a focus on African and Afro-American themes. Special events including performances and workshops are often hosted here."
"GLBT items of every sort from T-shirts and greeting cards to leather and fetish wear. They sell GLBT-themed videos, too, both mainstream films and more ""adult"" fare."
"Owned by two thousand locals who've invested in this cooperative, the market is open to anyone who wants to buy their groceries from a non-profit rather than enrich the Wegman family coffers. They'll be moving to a larger location in the South Wedge in 2016."
"One of three very good local chocolatiers, Andy's Candies has been distributing sweets since 1917. The Hudson Avenue location, where the shop was founded, is the main factory; it's only open occasionally for retail business. To buy chocolates, you'd best head to one of the suburban outlets. In addition to the ones below, there are stores in Victor, Penfield and Webster."
"Great gift shop with an eclectic selection. They sell children's toys, cards, jewelry, incense, stones, musical instruments, chimes, housewares, unconventional clothing items, and more. All at a variety of price points; it's not all cheap kitsch and it's not all pricey luxury. Well worth a stop in to browse, if nothing else."
"The legendary Bop Shop made its name at the Village Gate but has now set up shop at a larger location on Monroe Avenue. The shop is still crammed to overflowing with vinyl records, cassette tapes, and compact discs covering every era and every style. True music-lovers can spend hours pawing through the racks and uncovering treasure after treasure&mdash;albums they either never knew existed, or haven't seen in decades. The staff are all highly knowledgeable collectors and they love to talk music with customers. Often hosts jazz concerts; see web site for schedule."
"There are a few good comic shops in Rochester, but Comics Etc. has long been one of the best. Recently booted from the Village Gate, the shop still has legions of loyal customers who tout the extensive back-issue selection and dedicated service."
"Housed in a converted firehouse, this store is unique and probably one of the most unusual stores you will ever go to. Everything is handmade and for sale. Very artsy and not mass marketed."
"Fleet Feet Rochester (there's also a Fleet Feet Syracuse) in 2014 was named one of the top 50 running stores in the country. Probably the best place in the region to get running shoes. They have two locations."
"A nice selection of new and used books, with some older items that one simply can't find in large chain bookstores. Of particular interest is the selection of books covering both historical and modern Rochester."
"Right next door to their sister ice cream shop, Hedonist has a variety of creative chocolate confections, changing seasonally. The raved-about specialty is their salted caramels."
"The ""Great, Great House of Guitars"" has a huge selection of new and used records, CD's, and cassettes, most of which you won't be able to find anywhere else. The store is also a shrine to music and musicians, with an extensive collection of instruments for sale. Some of the biggest music groups in the world (Metallica, Ozzy, ""Weird Al"", etc.) go out of their way to come to this store, because of the selection and the knowledgeable, well-connected staff."
"An organic and natural-food superstore; incredible selection and very good service."
"The most typically Park Avenue of all the Park Avenue stores, Parkleigh is a gift shop ''par excellence''. One of the oldest retailers of MacKenzie-Childs ceramics, they also specialize in gourmet coffee and tea."
"A Rochester icon with probably the biggest selection of used vinyl records in the city. It doesn't have a great selection of newer records, but it will wow you with its extensive collection of used records. The Record Archive also hosts many concerts on a stage located in the middle of its spacious warehouse. Famous among locals for the dancing-record-guy commercials."
"This friendly boutique sells nothing that was not manufactured or assembled in the state of New York. You'll find foodstuffs of all kinds, of course, but also fine silverware, musical instruments, backpacks, and licensed puzzles and games from Buffalo Games. A great place to go to get gifts and souvenirs, or even just for your regular shopping."
"The candy and chocolate at Stever's is made fresh daily, in small batches, so you know you're getting the freshest stuff possible. Their specialty is sponge candy, a Western New York favorite."
"Hip clothing and gift boutique in the South Wedge."
"Massive selection of domestic and craft beers from all over North America and beyond. Great place for home-brewing supplies. 30 rotating taps to fill growlers! Most beers are in walk-in coolers, cold and ready to go!"
"A huge selection of both macro and micro brews from all over the world, plus home-brewing supplies. Also has a large display filled with good cigars. Word to the wise: the owners are quite stand-offish, especially to first time customers and some of the beers are not that fresh. Watch out for dust!"
"In the highly regarded Pittsford Plaza, Century Liquor has a very large selection of wine and liquor, including vintage. Receives tour buses from the nearby vineyard- and winery-laden Finger Lakes, which is the second largest wine producing area in the U.S."
"Wide selection of imported, domestic and New York wines and very helpful staff. Off-street parking."
"Located near numerous other small shops and cafes, this wine dealer has a very friendly staff and carries many quality wines from the Finger Lakes region."
"The largest local burger chain may also be the best, with a wide-ranging menu of burgers, hots, wings, and ""plates"". With eight locations in and around the city, and four more in the outer suburbs, you won't have to go far to find one. In a delicious local partnership, several locations have Abbott's Frozen Custard stands right inside, and most have a game room as well."
"This location is housed in a tiny 1950s-type diner, long and narrow like a train car. The diner, which used to be known as the Skyliner Diner, is in turn located in the lobby of the Strong National Museum of Play. No museum admission is needed to get to the restaurant (or to the carousel, for that matter!)."
"Considered one of Rochester's best-kept secrets by the downtown lunch crowd, this tiny eatery offers a huge menu of Mediterranean specialties. Don't see what you want? Just ask; the staff is extremely accommodating; they'll make sure you get something you like. The falafel comes highly recommended."
"This tiny joint northeast of the airport is no longer Rochester's best-kept-secret; Adam Richman's ''Man vs. Food Nation'' recently featured Campi's signature dish, the massive Steak Bomber. Take a huge pile of sliced chuck, top it with carmelized onions and other veggies, add Rochester's meaty hot sauce, and put it all on a 12-inch-diameter toasted roll."
"Dog themed restaurant known for garbage plates and hot dogs with a huge variety of toppings. Tahou's will always be the original, but most locals hold up Dogtown's garbage plates as the best in town."
"One of ""Hot Dog Row"" burger joints in the Seabreeze neighborhood. Motto: ""Where Quality Predominates"". They have another location in Penfield at Lloyd's Corners."
"The best subs in Rochester, hands down. It's the rolls, freshly baked in-house, that do it. Red Osier roast beef and other high-quality toppings put Subway to shame. The cookies are also among the best in town."
"This new flagship location includes soups and salads in addition to the usual subs, chips, and cookies."
"Though they didn't invent Buffalo-style chicken wings, most Buffalo natives will tell you that Duff's perfected them. They opened their first Rochester franchise in December 2015, where they serve wings (with a variety of sauces) and sandwiches."
"With an ever-changing eight-flavor lineup, Hedonist offers premium small-batch ice cream in the South Wedge. The goodies are made on-site with local ingredients, including cream from Pittsford Dairy. It's outstanding ice cream, but you'll pay for the indulgence."
"A popular hangout with local college students, there's cheap food and it's always open."
"Located in the Twelve Corners area of Brighton, this Jewish (and Kosher) bakery makes European-style breads and pastries. They always have great challah, rye, pumpernickel, white and sour dough, and then each day of the week turn out specialty breads, like the not-to-be-missed chocolate babka (Th F Su) and poppyseed danish (Th F Su)."
"This is where drunk college kids stumble off of Monroe Ave. to eat a garbage plate. The garbage plates from establishments that reside inside the city limits of Rochester have a decidedly more flavorful character than those in the suburbs. Mark's is the only diner you might ever visit that has a bouncer. Go if only for the spectacle."
"Tahou's is the origin of Rochester's authentic cuisine, the '''garbage plate'''. For a few dollars, the plates come with your choice of meat, macaroni salad, home fries, onions and special sauce. The most common plate can be ordered by as quickly as possible saying ""Cheeseburger plate, mac salad, home fries, everything!""."
"The ""food truck"" phenomenon comes to Irondequoit Bay via this mobile food boat. Two gentlemen head out onto the Bay and Lake Ontario, grilling up burgers, dishing out salads, and scooping Perry's ice cream for hungry boaters."
"As if a little slice of Brooklyn has been transported to Rochester, the Pizza Stop makes pizzas the way they do downstate; even NYC transplants approve! In addition to the thin Neapolitan style, they make a mean thick Sicilian as well, and their stuffed pizza is just over-the-top ridiculous. Their new location just down the street from the original opened in January 2015."
"The Greece location has the same great pizza and an extended menu."
"Red Osier is best known for their Landmark Restaurant in Genesee County, which serves amazing prime rib. But their catering division, which focuses on hot prime rib sandwiches, has been expanding in recent years (you can find them at Frontier Field, Sahlen's Stadium, and even the airport, for instance). Their latest venture is this sandwich shop in the middle of downtown. The prime rib is as juicy and tasty as you'll find anywhere, but they've also got Zweigle's hot dogs, pizza, wings, and specialty sandwiches, all made fresh daily. You can put Dinosaur BBQ sauce on your beef, or try the beef-on-weck pizza (when available)."
"This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo, advertises that they ""deliver everything... but babies!"" But primarily, they deliver pizza, and they've become very successful doing so. Pizza experts scoff at the quality of their pies, but with almost 30 locations in Monroe, Livingston, Ontario, and Wayne Counties, they must be doing something right."
"Another Rochester burger joint that grew up along the beach, this one in Greece west of the river. The Greece location has some excellent ice cream."
"Just as authentic as Nick Tahou's, but in a safer part of the city and always open."
"Vic & Irv's was one of the restaurants on Hot Dog Row, sitting between Bill Gray's and Don's Original. But it closed in 2014, and the manager and many of the employees opened up a new spot just up the road, called Vic's Place. The menu of hots and ground steak sandwiches remains largely the same."
"The premier Ethiopian restaurant in Rochester is back! Formerly located in the Grove Place district on University Avenue, Abyssinia opened in 2000 but had to close after a dispute with the property owner. After over a year without a home, they've moved to Mount Hope Plaza, and their many fans couldn't be happier. Go for the combos, which are served ''injera'' (Ethiopian bread) or the clay pots of lamb or beef."
"Serves lunch and dinner. Though located away from other travel attractions, the noodles are some of the best in Rochester. Second location in Perinton south of Fairport."
"Wegmans recently replaced their old East Avenue store&mdash;the only one left in the city proper&mdash;with a brand new one, even carving out space along the crowded East Ave for this new restaurant. Amore serves up Italian classics&mdash;made mostly with Wegmans-brand ingredients&mdash;in a peaceful and casually elegant atmosphere. It's isolated from the rest of the store, so don't worry about dodging shopping carts or dealing with the noise of the grocery."
"If less traditional, more experimental/Western, sushi sounds interesting to you, pay a visit to this excellent sushi restaurant and bar. A special each day of the week; the best values for your buck are the Wednesday $20 all-you-can-eat and the Sunday 3-for-$12 deals."
"This restaurant, named after its location in Village Gate Square, specializes in burgers and flatbread pizzas, but with a distinctly upscale twist. High-quality ingredients creatively applied to these staple menu items make the Gate House a very popular place for dinner before a show at the nearby Auditorium Theatre. Of course, this is Rochester, so you can even get a fancy version of a garbage plate. Reservations recommended."
"Rochester's last classic diner. A 1948 Orleans diner restored in 1986 to an art deco style. Their motto is ""real food, served real well at real prices"". A neighborhood joint with very good food. Friendly, personal service (the owner himself often takes orders) and fantastic Sunday breakfast/brunch menu: berries & peaches stuffed French toast, tasty savory omelets and a glorious eggs Benedict. Be sure to ask for ""sweet cheese"" on your waffles, pancakes & French toast."
"A cozy eatery in the heart of the Park Avenue neighborhood, offering traditional fare with a slight upscale twist. Most entrees change daily, though a few are constants. Parking is iffy."
"Housed in a former firehouse, Hose 22 offers up great American grill fare."
"According to the jingle, ""Sooner or later, everyone dines at Jines,"" which may only be a slight exaggeration. Jines is one of a cluster of restaurants at the corner of Park and Berkeley, each with very popular sidewalk tables (at least in nice weather), which makes this a particularly lively and inviting stretch of Park Avenue. Jines was part of the wave of Greek-American diners that opened in the 60s and 70s, though this is more ""family restaurant"" than ""greasy spoon"". The atmosphere and service are familial (the Gines family still runs the place), and the menu is extensive, hearty, and not without its creativity."
"Located in Henrietta, a sprawling suburb that features mostly grimly terrible chain restaurants, this fantastic Thai spot features reasonable prices, lightning quick service (seriously, it's like they know what you're going to order before you get there) and food that always tastes uncannily fresh and yummy. The ambiance is not great, with a huge cavernous dining room and terrible, terrible art on the walls, but the food is consistently good and you can always get takeout. Make sure to try the Thai iced tea. No need to bother with reservations. Open for lunch and dinner."
"Located in Rochester's snootiest suburb, you wouldn't expect the best deal in Rochester, but this charming restaurant will give you the most bang for your buck. Authentic and carefully prepared, don't miss the huge mezede village platter (an appetizer that can be easily shared by two or more), gyros and well-spiced kebabs. Lots for vegetarians, and unbelievable sweet potato fries. Reservations only taken for 3 or more. On the weekends they're basically required, or you'll wait hours for a table."
"This popular Japanese restaurant specializes in sushi, particularly their sushi rolls, each of which has a rather unique moniker. The Yummy Yummy Roll is highly recommended, but you can also try the Red Dragon Roll, BFF Roll, or of course a Rochester Roll. Other typical Japanese-American dishes are available as well."
"Vietnamese cuisine. Very large portions."
"Features extensive Korean menu -- Korean BBQ, scallion pancakes, spicy stews, etc. All meals come with lots of tasty extras, like fermented black beans and kimchee."
"Looks like nothing from the outside, an easily miss-able hole-in-the-wall place on South Clinton. But inside the tiny space is a little haven, authentically Japanese, with rice-paper screens and the most perfectly prepared sushi in Rochester. The only staff are the friendly Japanese owners who will offer lots of guidance if you ask."
"Classy yet casual, one of the newest and best-reviewed restaurants in downtown. They have positioned themselves as a great place to get dinner after seeing a performance at the Eastman Theater or Downstairs Cabaret. Dinner-and-theater packages available with some Auditorium Theatre shows; being able to park at the restaurant is a major benefit. Go for sandwiches if you want to spend less than $10, or steaks or seafood if you're willing to spend about $20."
"Upstate NY chain sports bar with an enormous menu. The real attraction is the chicken tenders and honey mustard which are nothing like the frozen variety served at most sports bars. There are dozens of televisions which makes it a good place to watch a game."
"The Beale is known for their great BBQ dishes, but they've also got some good Cajun and Creole offerings. There is also live music&mdash;blues, primarily&mdash;five nights a week. In addition there is a good selection of beers at the front bar to go with the food."
"Amazing Ribs, Chicken, and Black Beans and Rice among many other things. Expect to wait though! Average wait for a table is easily an hour, they don't take reservations, and unless your whole group is there you can't get on the list. They're a tad vigilant about it, but the place pushes so much business through they can afford to do so. The Dino is a must when in Rochester, if only for some of the sauce."
"Opened in July 2012, this establishment in Charlotte offers barbecue ""with a Spanish flair""."
"Again, it's not Dino, but Sticky Lips has its own vibe and charm. Its sauce bottles are decorated with 1940s-style pinups, and the decor features advertisements and periodicals from the same era. The food is good, too, with a very wide variety of options and combos, and five different sauces to choose from. Best part: they're never as crowded as Dinosaur."
"The second location along Henrietta's commercial strip is much bigger, with live music just about every night and a full bar. It was absolutely slammed during its first few months, but crowds have moderated a bit; still, it's not a bad idea to get there early on Friday and Saturday evenings."
"2 Vine calls its combination of French and Italian food a ""bistrotoria""&mdash;that is, a combination of a bistro with a trattoria. The new decor and menu, introduced in 2016, reflects a renewed focus on casual accessibility. Delicious vegetarian dishes, as well as a wide selection of fish, veal, etc. Moderately priced and near The Little Theatre."
"While the Bake Shop offers light sandwich fare and breakfast dishes, the real attraction here for foodies is their Edible Atlas dinner series. Every two weeks, the kitchen selects a whole new cuisine to present to intrepid diners, be it Mexican, Korean, Greek, or anything else the chefs can think of. The menu is set in advance; all you have to choose is your beverage. You'll want to get reservations, though, as the restaurant offers only 18 seats for each of its two seatings twice weekly."
"Pretty good reviews for this new restaurant. Check out the 18,000 pennies lining the floor of the lobby; altogether, they'd pay for a meal for six."
"After several years of decline, the former Grill at the Strathallan has been rejuvenated as Char Steak & Lounge, and it's still one of the finest dining options in Rochester. Upscale American cuisine in a contemporary lounge setting. (Also open for breakfast, featuring DoubleTree hotels' standard breakfast menu.)"
"Despite the name, this isn't some Chinese takeout joint. One of the most eclectic, see-and-be-seen restaurant/bars in Rochester, it's like Grinnell's for hipsters (but in a good way). The menu is ever-changing, but a few staples are always there, including the full pound hamburger. Other options often involve rabbit, duck, and squid, to give you an idea. Even the more pedestrian options, like the pizza and the steak sandwich, are made with high-end ingredients like bison-milk mozzarella. Whatever you order, plan to share it with the rest of your party; all of the dishes are meant to be sampled, family-style. Reservations strongly recommended."
"This is the type of place your parents went to for their 5th anniversary&mdash;take that as you will. While the menu is firmly rooted in the 60s and 70s, Grinnell's devoted customers keep coming back for the absolutely impeccable service. From the complimentary valet parking, to the maître d' up front (usually the owner himself), to the veteran servers, the restaurant's staff perfectly balances a friendly, welcoming atmosphere with the courteous respect that defined mid-century hospitality. The food is highly acclaimed as well, though it's hardly adventurous; just basic well made steaks, chops, and seafood."
"With a name that means ""slow"", Lento prides itself on taking no shortcuts in the preparation of fine meals. Everything on the menu, right down to the ketchup on the $12 burgers, is made in-house, from primarily local ingredients whenever possible. The care taken in preparation is reflected in the quality of the food. Lunch service began in Spring 2012, with a focus on getting diners in and out relatively quickly."
"Not an ideal destination for vegetarians, this offshoot of the other Max restaurants focuses firmly on red meat, with a bit of seafood for flavor."
"Considered one of the top restaurants in Rochester, with an elegant atmosphere and a menu to match."
"This restaurant is owned by Wegmans and showcases what Wegmans chefs can do. The menu changes frequently and covers a wide variety of cuisines. The cocktails are something special and are made with the freshest ingredients possible since the flagship Wegmans store is located across the street."
"The former location of Rochester's most upscale restaurant, the '''Rio Bamba''', is now a slightly less upscale Mexican-American restaurant. The Bamba's unique Latin-themed decor remains, however, and the unique cuisine continues to get good reviews. Pig's ears, anyone? Or fried insects? If you want more traditional fare, the tortillas are freshly made in-house."
"The food is only ok, heavy, traditional French&mdash;good for a business lunch or unadventurous out of town guests&mdash;but the desserts are ''spectacular'', with emphasis on pies, tortes, tarts, cakes and specialty cheesecakes. Examples include their Chocolate Tiramisu Torte and White Chocolate Carrot Cake. The mere mention of a trip here for coffee and dessert will get Rochesterians salivating. A full dessert menu is available in the restaurant, but the cakes can also be ordered whole and picked up."
"Creative contemporary Southern/American fare in a very ''cool'' renovated industrial setting. Enjoy the lively bar and its scintillating decor, the breezy and fresh patio, or the somewhat quieter upstairs dining room. Not a place for comfort food; in fact, the menu occasionally errs on the side of weirdness, but it changes seasonally so it's always worth taking a chance."
"Nestled in Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood, near the Highland Park Diner, Rooney's doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside, though, is one of the city's best-kept secrets. Upscale dining in a rustic-romantic atmosphere makes this an excellent choice for anyone wanting to impress a guest. The menu is upscale American&mdash;veal, duck, lamb, swordfish, etc."
"Possibly the most expensive meal in Rochester... or, for that matter, in the entire six-county area. The menu represents all of the high-end standards without going overboard on the creativity. The service is regarded by locals as impeccable."
"An old military armory is the setting for this trendy, upscale-casual hotspot. What does upscale casual mean? Consider that there's a variety of contemporary dishes on the menu, but you'll also find a ""burger bar"". (Sunday brunch includes a ""hangover burger"" and fried PB&J among other treats.) Put on your best pair of jeans and enjoy. Some diners report inconsistent experiences with the food and service, but the unique setting and romantic atmosphere more than make up for any snags; TRATA is all about the atmosphere and the environment. There's a rooftop bar and some amazing outdoor seating available; inside there are more bars and seating across three floors of space."
"Don't go looking for a storefront proudly signed as ""Uncle Ralph's""&mdash;Ralph takes his show on the road to different establishments around the city. His schedule varies seasonally, so check the web site. Wherever he's at, and whatever the weather, Uncle Ralph cooks up a variety of meat-based entrees on his outdoor grills."
"A high-end, thoroughly vegan French bistro. It's a little piece of French countryside transplanted to Rochester, but without a drop of milk or morsel of meat anywhere. While the entrees are outstanding, the desserts and coffees suffer a bit from the lack of true dairy; almond-milk ice cream just isn't the same. Still, if you're looking for a truly vegan restaurant&mdash;and not just ""vegan-friendly""&mdash;you'll find yourself at home here."
"The walls display various works of art created by local artists, and the stage area/dance floor has an entire roomful of furniture arranged on the ceiling. Drink specials and live entertainment are featured here nightly, presenting popular local and national musical artists."
"This speakeasy-style bar serves up classic pre-Prohibition cocktails and inventive newly crafted ones with a sophisticated style."
"The founders of this newspaper-themed tavern (with a speakeasy feel) call their establishment a ""gastro-lounge"", with a focus on custom cocktails and artisan foods."
"This popular sports bar and grill is expanding and now has four locations around Rochester. The food&mdash;including steaks&mdash;is quite good for a place known mostly as a sports bar. Also worthy of note are the specials: Before 10PM, there is a different draft beer on sale every day of the week. After 10PM, the beer sale ends, but all appetizers are half off. Naturally, the best time to arrive is 9:45PM."
"The epitome of the neighborhood bar, Jeremiah's is best known for its award-winning wings."
"Lux is something of an alternative bar in Rochester and trades on being in the South Wedge to add cred to the atmosphere. Lots of tattoos and piercings and a good PBR special. The back yard is great. They have hammocks in the summer time and a huge wood burning stove for the winter. This place is something you would expect to find in Brooklyn not Rochester."
"Once a speakeasy during Prohibition, this joint was one of the first in the area to get a liquor license after it was repealed. Today, it's a wild and raucous neighborhood bar; there's no food, but folks come for the drinks and the atmosphere. The deck extends out onto the beach for a great view of Lake Ontario. Parking is non-existent; you'll have to jockey for a spot on the south side of Culver. 21+ only."
"A Mexican restaurant and bar, known for its frozen drinks and Cinco de Mayo parties."
"Rochester's ""soccer friendly"" sports bar. Large selection of single malt scotches and port wine, beer with an emphasis on Belgian drafts."
"Nox eagerly embraces its ""nerd pub"" reputation, naming its menu items and cocktails with pop culture references, from Dracula and Sherlock Holmes to ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter''. The house-designed cocktails are the main attraction, while the food menu focuses on hearty comfort food that uses modern gourmet ingredients."
"Great English beer, poor English food, friendly English staff. A unique atmosphere with reasonable prices, the Toad is an excellent place to get sloshed."
"A retro contemporary lounge with nightly house music DJ's spinning."
"With a name that harkens back to the famous Pythodd Club, the Pythodd Jazz Room seeks to rekindle Rochester's jazz scene. Live music every night starting at 7:30PM."
"Although Rohrbach's is a bit out of the way, their beer is worth the trip. Certainly the highlight is the Scotch Ale, and if you don't want to travel all the way to the actual brewpub, any number of establishments in the city will have it on tap, including Frontier Field. However, if there, do try as many of the beers as possible, as it is some of the best craft-brewing in upstate NY. You can get a sampler of 3 oz. glasses before you decide. The food is also quite good and leans toward German fare such as sauerbraten and bratwurst."
"A new English-style pub has replaced the Table 7 lounge."
"This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave is truly a hidden treasure. It has some of the nicest staff you will find in the city and an overall friendly atmosphere. They also know how to pour the finest Guinness in the city. Although located near the U of R, Sheridan's is hardly a college bar attracting a diverse crowd. The food is also excellent, especially the fish fry that is served on Friday night."
"Where the martinis are as big as the day is long.... so kick off your heels, and loosen your tie."
"This place is the closest Rochester has to a NYC style club. Posh and dramatic the club spins dance/house music on one side with chill/down tempo beats on the other. The club is gay friendly, with Friday night being straight night."
"Turcott's Taproom is an English-style pub."
"Just opened in May 2012, Vibe is bringing jazz, blues, and comedy shows to the Village Gate."
"Tons of Belgian and Belgian-style beers on tap at this Downtown bar. Victoire has a large indoor seating area complete with fireplace, but the real attraction is the patio during warmer months, which also has a fireplace because this is Rochester."
"You can get meals here&mdash;with waitstaff, no less&mdash;but the drinks are the attraction at this spot that just opened in August 2012. In keeping with the name, drink prices fluctuate based on popularity... just like stock prices. Keep an eye on the price ticker; buy low and sell high!"
"The name is apropos, as this bar does indeed specialize in chocolates and wines&mdash;the former more so than the latter, some would argue. Still, the wine selection is expertly paired with the desserts, making this a very popular place for ending an evening on the town. Housed in an historic century-old house, the bar has a summer patio that looks out on the lovely Neighborhood of the Arts, a great place for people-watching."
"Dressy, sophisticated, and urbane, Flight might be the most well known wine bar in the city. As you might guess, they specialize in wine ""flights""&mdash;tastings of a selection of wines based around a theme. You can try three different wines made from the same grape, or perhaps three different grapes from the same region. It's not just wine, either: cheese, chocolate, and even olive oil are presented in flights of three."
"A small but high-quality wine bar in the South Wedge. Some people find the service a bit off-putting, and the lack of seating can be a deterrent, but the wine list is well curated. Also consider heading up the stairs to '''Cheshire''', a classic cocktail bar, which tends to get even better reviews."
"The owners of Veritas left Rochester for New York City, where they developed their love of wine. But years later, they returned to raise their family in a more affordable city. In 2012, they opened this wine bar, which, in their words, aims to be ""casual, warm and educational"". This is achieved through a constantly changing menu of wines presented in a calm but cozy atmosphere. The owners are happy to talk about wine with anyone, novice or expert, and it's quickly becoming a destination for wine-lovers who enjoy company while they indulge."
"This cider-only bar just opened in December 2015 and has a dozen ciders on tap and over 100 more in bottles, as well as knowledgeable staff who can help you make a selection. As far as bar food goes, the house specialty is kettle corn, presented in seasonal varieties."
"While distilling has started to grow in the otherwise wine-mad Finger Lakes region, its production has not been seen in Rochester in quite some time. Black Button uses local ingredients to make corn whiskey, wheat vodka, and gin at their new distillery. Tours and a tasting bar are the amenities available for visitors."
"An independently owned coffee shop with regular live music. Their web page lists upcoming acts. Drinks and snacks are typical coffee shop prices. Free WiFi on the premises."
"Pet-friendly coffee shop in the Village Gate."
"Laid-back lounge-type bar aimed at young professionals."
"This coffee shop opened in May 5th 2006 and is fairly new to the South Wedge area. It has a great open minded atmosphere and has a GLBT gift shoppe. The coffee, smoothies, and pastries are temptations."
"Another downtown coffee shop, more popular with the art house crowd. Java's prices and products are similar to Spot. They also sell a variety of large homemade cookies in a variety of styles for about a dollar. At lunch time, an adjacent cafe-style restaurant serves for soup and sandwiches. Local art adorns the walls and local bands of questionable quality occasionally perform."
"A tribal arts importer orders select creations from area bakers, inviting guests to dine among large African statues. Take in a coffee while you wrestle with desires for an amber necklace."
"A coffee roaster and full service coffee and espresso bar located near the Neighborhood of the Arts, Joe Bean has been mentioned among the best coffee shops in the country. They serve some food as well, but the real attraction is the java, which is fair trade and eco-friendly, and roasted right in-house. The focus at Joe Bean is on coffee education; they believe that good coffee can be savored and analyzed like good wine, and they even offer classes on how to make your own."
"A trendy, popular hangout housed in a former Chevrolet dealership, people come here to relax and socialize while enjoying a cup or two of the brown brew. It's quite acceptable to spend hours here while only buying a single small cup of coffee; students do it all the time. Local art of various sorts is often marked for sale on the walls."
"A funky space named after Van Gogh's famous painting, near many of Rochester's museums. Along with the required drinks, they make their own soup, salads and sandwiches. Free WiFi."
"This property first opened in 1954 as part of the ""Treadway Inn"" chain; it was the country's very first downtown motel. The motel changed hands several times over the years, and had been in a state of disrepair and disrepute since the 1980s. In 2012, however, new ownership invested heavily in the property and now touts this venerable institution as Rochester's only downtown boutique hotel. Indeed, the updated decor, furnishings, and amenities have brought new life to this once-moribund location, and early reviews are very positive. Between the much-needed updates and the hotel's prime location in the busy nightlife district of the East End, this could once again become one of the city's most popular hotels, as it was in the 50s."
"Twenty-five-story downtown hotel connected via enclosed walkway to Rochester Riverside Convention Center, making it one of two hotels of choice for conventioneers. One of the tallest buildings in Rochester."
"The newest downtown hotel is five stories with 106 guest rooms. The developers converted three existing historic buildings into a modern hotel, in the process uncovering and restoring some unique architectural details dating back nearly a century. Their on-site restaurant is '''Drifters L.B.''', featuring higher-end comfort food made with local ingredients, and a wine list heavy on Finger Lakes vintages."
"Just opened in 2015, this new hotel is a fairly generic mid-priced hotel; it's main calling card is its proximity to Strong Memorial Hospital and the adjacent College Town retail/lifestyle center."
"On the west side of the river is another high-rise hotel, not connected to the convention center, but still within walking distance of High Falls or the Blue Cross Arena."
"Romantic, turn of the century, old world city architecture inside the Inner Loop. Gracious low-key service. Beautifully decorated suites, artfully articulated interior finishes. Beloved by its many guests. Highly regarded, wonderful on-site restaurant, Tournedos. Poised for future expansion."
"This hotel lives up to its name&mdash;it's right on the eastern bank of the river. It's the other popular choice for conventioneers, since it's connected to the Riverside Convention Center across Main Street by the Skyway. It's a bit cheaper than the Hyatt. Their sports bar and grill, '''Legends''', is one of the only mid-scale eateries in the downtown area."
"Designed for extended stays, this hotel is just across the river from the University of Rochester's River Campus (there's a pedestrian bridge nearby). That makes it very popular for graduation and homecoming weekends. Each unit has a full kitchen and living room."
"The only hotel near the Neighborhood of the Arts, the Strathallan is almost legendary around Rochester. In the early 2000s, it started to lose its reputation as the best large hotel in Rochester, but a $10 million renovation and expansion project in 2012 seems to have restored its former glory. Now affiliated with Hilton's DoubleTree brand, the hotel has added a pool, as well as new meeting space on its top floor, with some beautiful views of the city. The fabulous Grill at the Strathallan, one of the finest dining establishments in Rochester, has been renamed to '''[http://www.charsteakandlounge.com Char Steak and Lounge]'''; the atmosphere and menu have both been modernized, with customers enjoying innovative American cuisine (with prices to match)."
"Directly across the street from Rochester International Airport. Stay and Fly package available with free airport transportation."
"100% non-smoking studio suites. Indoor pool and spa, free Wi-Fi access, complimentary breakfast."
"A nice hotel with an incredible six-story glass arboretum (the hotel was called the ""Holidome"" when it was a Holiday Inn). Well worth stopping in just to see the foliage and landscaping inside."
"One of three hotels near the airport. It's located in a tiny wedge of Gates, surrounded on all four sides by the city of Rochester, and just across I-390 from the airport. Other than its location, it's a typical Holiday Inn."
"Free airport transportation available."

Its cylindrical lower part was built on the remains of the Roman town wall, and served as the north tower of the city from the 13th century onwards.

"The ruins of this 13th century castle are located in the city centre. While the remains are not substantial enough to warrant a special visit, the contrast of the battlements against the more contemporary architecture of its surroundings does provide an interesting backdrop for souvenir photographs of Swansea city centre - the building is floodlit at night."
"This elegant building of white Portland stone has graced the city centre's western approach since 1934. The main building only houses administrative offices and is of no interest to the casual visitor. However, Sir Frank Brangwyn's murals (originally intended for the House of Lords, but considered too frivolous) that grace the interior of the '''Brangwyn Hall''' are definitely worth viewing. The Brangwyn Hall is on the sea-facing side of the building and functions as the city's main concert and reception hall."

King Edward 1 is recorded to have visited the castle in December 1284. The present day remains are well preserved and the battlements offer commanding views over Swansea Bay. There is a small entry fee."
"Mumbles. Built in the 1880s to encourage more passengers to use the Mumbles Train, the pier is an edifice to the Victorians' love of the ocean. Compared to many piers around the country, Mumbles is quite simple in design, but the 255m walk from beginning to end allows for spectacular views over Swansea Bay. In particular, Oystermouth Castle and the high rise buildings of the city centre are in clear view."
"Housed in an iconic building clad in Welsh slate, the National Waterfront Museum represents an exciting and innovative way to explore the development of the industrial revolution - through the eyes of the people whose lives it touched and transformed.

There are also cafes and gift shops overlooking the marina. This is one of the UK's most imaginative exhibition spaces and must-see destinations."
"This splendid example of early 19th century Doric style architecture served as Swansea Guildhall for over 100 years.

"Solid concrete modernist church designed by famous architect Reima Pietilä in 1966. It is likely the most important piece of architecture in Tampere. Locals call it ""The Silo of Souls"" (''Sielujen siilo'') and from the outside it's not hard to see why, but the stark interior is quite awe-inspiring: very high and big room without pillars, minimalist interior made of bright wood. Some Sundays, community members guide onto the roof, which offers a good view over Tampere, and let one have a nice view from the top into the church room."

The jury unanimously chose the design by Raili and Reima Pietilä. The architects said they had been influenced by various elements, such as Celtic ornaments, sheep horns and glacial spin formations. The basic idea was a space coiling spirally like the shell of a snail. The form of a bird appeared in the design process. Increasingly, the building began to resemble a large game bird, the capercaillie, known in Finnish as ''metso'' &mdash; now the building's nickname. Seen from above, the building looks like a bird carrying a shield. Houses the '''Tampere Mineral Museum'''."

The beautiful Pyynikki esker surrounding the tower was selected as nationally valuable landscape attraction in 1993. The current over 80-year-old tower is 26 meters (85 feet) tall, and at top there are scenic levels both indoors and out in the open air. The top can be accessed by both elevator and stairs, and the entrance fee is 1 euro for children from 4 to 15 years and 2 euros for anyone older. Even if the height of the tower itself wouldn't feel spectacular, considering its location at the top of the Pyynikki esker in the middle of Tampere it is obvious that the view from the top is clear and magnificent in every direction!"

In Hervanta, there's a popular 4km loop trail around lake Suolijärvi (take bus number 30 to get there)."

Be aware that it's only safe to walk on well-frozen lake. Only go if you see other people (and not just ice-fishers) doing so."
"The oldest still-functioning public sauna in Finland. Located in historical Pispala, easily reached with buses 1, 13, 18, 19, 25 and 26. In old days, people who didn't have a sauna of their own went to a public sauna to clean up.

It is quite a spectacle as these large, elegant white and rusty orange birds arrive in countless groups and tussle for the prime roosting spots. Each morning at dawn they leave en-masse to find feeding spots around the island. Some also breed in the area and nests can be seen in the roadside trees. The cattle egrets are joined by smaller numbers of little egrets and Javan pond herons. :According to local legend, the egrets first appeared here in such large numbers after one of the worst massacres of suspected communists during the troubles of 1965. This led local villagers to believe that these birds are the souls of the slaughtered, and ceremonies to that effect are still held today. :The village of Petulu is reached by heading east from Ubud town centre on Jl Raya Ubud until you meet the obvious junction with Jl Raya Andong. Turn left, and go up the hill for about 2&nbsp;km until you see the sign posted left turning on Jalan Kintamani to Petulu village.

"This is a double storey warren of stalls bursting at the seams with wood carvings, batik shirts, sarongs, and all manner of other souvenirs aimed specifically at tourists. The merchants here haggle with tourists for a living, and think nothing of asking for ten times the going price, so try to establish a baseline before you go in to buy. Most of the merchants downstairs will lose interest if you try to get a reasonable price. It is better to try the shops upstairs where you will find the same products often for sale at lower prices. You will still need to use your best bargaining skills of course. Try to avoid the period from 11AM-2PM when tour buses from further afield tend to arrive en-masse. :If hiring a car for a day, it might be worth it to make a stop in Tegallalang, where they are geared more towards wholesale buyers. The Sukawati Market is crowded and sells trinkets in bulk as well, but quality is dubious."
"Second hand bookstore. Also has great range of new books about Bali and Indonesia. Been around since 1986 and now has a second branch in Seminyak."

"This huge market is like a one-stop centre for all the craft villages between Sanur and Ubud. Many souvenir shop owners from around Bali wholesale purchase their items here, and prices are considerably lower than in the tourist centers like Kuta, Sanur, and Ubud town centre. For a taste of everyday, go to the food and produce market opposite the art market."
"A fair trade store that stocks commercially made, traditional hand-woven textiles from Bali and all points east in Indonesia. Or better yet, go to the shops that are actually from the villages and outer islands like Timor and Flores, and specialize in traditional weavings."
"Healthy and delicious Balinese cuisine with plenty of choices on the menu. If you have any special requests, Ibu Made will be happy to cater for you."

There are normal tables and chairs but you can also sit on the floor at low tables inside the ''bale'' (pavilion). Oka also has a branch in Mas ☎ +62 361 976345 on the main Teges-Sukawati road on the route between Ubud and the airport.

"Large, long-established restaurant serving western and local dishes, and plenty that fall somewhere in between."
"While China Moon is not packed during lunch and dinner time, it does have some of the better Chinese cuisine available in Ubud. The owner of the restaurant comes from Taiwan and is really passionate about cooking and helping customers. Unsurprisingly, Taiwanese food is the big thing here, so you might want to try the mushroom pork soup or any other stews and soups Taiwanese cuisine has to offer. Food from other regions of China is also served, as well as typical Balinese dishes (or a fusion of both). De Ubud Villas & Spa is from the same owner at the backside."

"Built in 1392, this gate was also part of the ancient wall and for a time also served as a prison. The gate has been massively renovated and somewhat modernized, but is still interesting and located across the street from the park. This tower also offers excellent views."
"Constructed in the early 14th century on the site of a Moorish palace, the building is essentially Moorish in design and originally functioned as the municipal granary; its name is derived directly from 'almud' (Arabic: bushel). The building was fully restored in 1996 and is now a venue for temporary art exhibitions."
"Although constructed in 1313 after the Christian reconquista, the bathhouse was built in the Arabic style and is considered to be an excellent example of Moorish architecture. It was used continuously as a bathhouse until the 20th century, and is one of the few remaining such structures in Spain. It was fully restored in 2005."
"These Gothic shipyards date to the early 14th century, and attained their current layout in 1500. Trade ships were built and repaired here, as well as galleys used for defense against Barbary pirates. Later the building was used as a storehouse for salt, and now functions as a venue for temporary exhibits. Due to the shifting coastline over the centuries, the shipyards are now two blocks inland from the shore."
"Originally the residence of the counts of Cervelló, this 18th-century palace became the official residence for visiting royalty following the demolition of the ''Palau Reial de València''. The building now houses a museum, the Municipal Archive, and the Serrano Morales Library. On the ground floor is an exhibit (in Catalan and Spanish) illustrating the historic events which took place here, and on the upper floor are the grand ballroom and Serrano Morales Library, with original murals and furnishings."
"Sant Vicent Ferrer, the principal patron saint of Valencia, was born in this house in 1350. The house was renovated numerous times, and has a chapel and well as well as 18th-century ceramic tile panels depicting the life of the saint."
"This extensive site was first uncovered in 1985 during preparations for new construction, which was subsequently cancelled. Excavations revealed archeological remains dating from the Moorish, Visigothic, and Roman periods. After completing excavations, the city of Valencia converted the site into an underground museum. Highlights include Roman baths, a Moorish courtyard, and various artifacts."
"This very ornate Baroque palace once served as the residence of the Marqués de Dos Aigües, and is now a museum. The ground and first floors showcase a collection of stagecoaches and period furniture, while the upper two floors house an extensive ceramics collection with a focus on historic Valencian pieces. Of particular note are Moorish ceramic tiles from the main mosque which was located on the site now occupied by the cathedral, as well as six plates designed by Picasso. Photography permitted, no flash."
"Housed in a former reservoir, this well-designed museum is dedicated to the developmental history of the city, from the Roman era until the present. Although labels are in Valencian and Spanish, booklets with English translations are available at the front desk. Constructed in 1850, the building itself is interesting in its own right as an excellent example of 19th century industrial architecture."
"Here is the Lladró Porcelain factory. Visitation is possibly only through a guided tour, which must be scheduled beforehand, either [http://www.lladro.com/company/book/ online] or via phone.

"This 17th-century former palace now houses over 2,000 pieces of art, with a primary focus on art of the 14th to 17th centuries. Highlights include an excellent collection of medieval altarpieces, a collection of engravings by the Italian artist Piranesi, and a handful of minor works by Velázquez, El Greco, and Goya.

The collection can only be viewed with a tour, offered in a number of European languages; to be sure there is a tour in your language it is best to reserve ahead, either by phone or [http://patriarcavalencia.es/contatti/?lang=en online]."
"The museum is devoted to civics and culture, with special exhibits focused on such topics as graphic design, photography, and cinema. The building and garden were designed by Valencian architect Guillermo Vázquez Consuegra."
"This was once home to two generations of the Benlliure family, headed by prominent Valencian artist José Benlliure. The early 20th-century residence has been maintained in three distinct sections, including the primary house with original furnishings and artworks, a lovely courtyard and garden, and a second building with a private study and more artworks."
"The former 19th-century residence is now a cultural centre which hosts temporary exhibits of contemporary art and photography, by Valencian, Spanish and international artists."
"The former convent now hosts rotating special exhibits showcasing local history as well as historic and contemporary artists from Valencia and outside the region."
"This well-preserved 14th-century Gothic palace now contains a permanent collection of contemporary Spanish art, with rotating exhibits."

"This unique underground gallery has been designed around the remains of a city wall from the Moorish period, complete with arches. The gallery is a venue for temporary exhibits of Spanish and international contemporary art."
"After catastrophic flooding in 1957, the Turia River was diverted to the south of the city, and the former river bed was converted into a 7km-long elongated park which spans many neighborhoods, ending at the City of Arts and Sciences. The park encompasses soccer and rugby fields, an artificial boating lake, athletics track, playgrounds, fountains, and cafés. Abundant bicycle paths make it an ideal place to get in a little exercise and sun."
"The centrepiece of this unusual playground is a 70m-long sculpture of Gulliver (from the classic book ''Gulliver's Travels''), who has been tied to the ground. Visitors can climb on and slide down the giant figure, much as Lillupitians might have. The sculpture was designed by Valencian artist and illustrator Sento Llobell."
"The oldest bridge in the city, with the current structure dating to the early 16th century. The two 17th-century sculptures of Valencian saints were originally on another nearby medieval bridge, and relocated to this bridge in the mid-20th century."
"Designed by Santiago Calatrava and built between 1991 and 1995, the bridge resembles a comb, hence the nickname 'La Peineta'."
"Established in 1802 by the University of Valencia, this lovely garden maintains extensive collections of plants from a number of different habitats. Most of the greenhouses date from the latter half of the 19th century, while the modern research center was completed in 2000."
"This formal Neoclassical garden was designed in the mid-19th century by Valencian architect Don Monleón for the aristocrat Marqués de San Juan. It was declared a 'National Artistic Garden' and is now maintained by the city of Valencia, which opened it to the public in 1973."
"As far as zoos go, this is more animal-friendly than most. Focused exclusively on African fauna, the modern zoo has been thoughtfully designed to provide maximum space in natural settings for its residents. A special highlight is the walk-in lemur exhibit (no touching or feeding)."
"Originally established by the Moors in the 13th century as gardens for the royal palace (no longer standing), this pleasant and popular park is the second-largest park in Valencia, after the Turia gardens. The park includes a rose garden, sculpture garden, bicycle track, and aviary. During the summer various festivals are held here."
"The museum is divided into several segments, covering Valencian contributions to the sciences, the ecology of the Valencian region, and of course paleontology with the requisite dinosaur skeletons."
"First established by the Moors and later rebuilt by Christians, this building served as the royal Valencian residence until its demolition in 1810. It was subsequently forgotten and then rediscovered in 1986. The partially-excavated site is now surrounded by a fence with informative panels in Valencian/Spanish/English."
"The ''Huerta'', the fertile region surrounding Valencia, has relied on artificial irrigation since antiquity. The tribunal was developed to mediate disputes between farmers, and is believed to date back to Roman times; it has operated in its current form since the Moorish era. The court consists of nine representatives who meet in public and issue judgments on water rights and usage. Proceedings are conducted in Valencian and verdicts are issued orally. Although today the court is largely ceremonial, verdicts are considered legally binding by the highest court in Madrid and by the EU. In 2009 it was listed by UNESCO as an 'intangible cultural heritage'."
"In use since 1807, the cemetery has some interesting mausoleums and is the final resting place for a number of notable Valencians, including members of the artistic Benlliure family, painter Joaquín Sorolla, and writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. For visitors with smartphone there is a helpful app ((iOS and Android; Spanish and Valencian only) which describes walking routes and gives grave locations."
"Crowds gather along bridges and the Túria river bed to hear the ''fallera mayor'' (principal fallera) announce the beginning of the Fallas season. Fireworks conclude the event."
"Brass bands parade down every street, followed by falleros and falleras throwing firecrackers."
"This is 120 kilos of gunpowder translated into a multi-sensory ‘symphony of noise’, and must be experienced to be understood, as it includes not just the noise but also the intense smell of gunpowder as well as the vibrations which can be felt through the entire body. The event is very popular and you should arrive at least an hour in advance."
"Casal fallers around the city decorate their streets with expensive street lighting displays, the most elaborate of which compete annually for the top prize. Three of the top contenders every year are located in the Ruzafa district, with the fourth in La Roqueta."
"The current year's ninots are placed on display, with visitors voting for their favourite ninot. The winning ninot is spared the flames of the Cremà and added to the permanent collection of the Museu Faller de València (listed below)."
"The ninots previously exhibited are now paraded through the streets, before being included in the falla monuments."
"The 15th marks the start of the assembling the elaborate 'fallas', which have been laboured over during the previous year. Construction must be completed by 08:00 on 16 March, or the falla will be disqualified for the competition. Tourist information offices have free maps available showing locations of the ''Selección Especiál'' fallas."
"The falleros and falleras from each 'casal faller' bring flowers in offering and used to decorate the mantle of an enormous effigy of the ''Virgen de los Desamparados'', located in the Plaça de la Virgen. Participants are dressed in traditional clothing, and the processions follow two main routes, each terminating at the cathedral: one proceeds westward down ''Carrer de de Pau / Calle de la Paz'', and the other northward up ''Carrer de Sant Vincent Màrtir / Calle San Vicente''."
"A nightly fireworks display between midnight and 01:30, with each night more impressive than the previous one, until culminating in the final display on the 18th, which is known as ''La Nit del Foc'' (the Night of Fire). This is also very crowded and you should arrive early to see it. The best location to view this is from pedestrian bridges crossing the Turía Park riverbed, or even better, from below the Palacio de la Musica."
"A parade featuring all types of spectacles involving fire. This parade may be canceled in inclement weather."
"At the end of a week displaying the 'fallas' are burnt. The fallas infantiles are burned at 22:00, the fallas mayores are burned anytime between midnight and 01:00, and the falla at the Plaça Ayuntamiento is burned last at 01:00. The most impressive to see are the fallas in the Sección Especiál, because these are the largest and most dramatic when they burn. These tend to be very crowded and one should arrive early, preferably an hour in advance. A good strategy is to visit a selection of fallas beforehand, and then to choose one to watch burn."
"Since 1934 ''ninots'' (papier-mâché figures) voted as the best of the year have been spared the final flames of the Fallas festival. Along with photos and posters, these figures are showcased in a building which has served as a lepers' hospital, barracks, and prison."
"As elsewhere in Spain, Valencia celebrates Holy Week with street processions of penitents, organised into fraternities. Although not as well known as the more elaborate processions in Andalusia and Castile and Leon, Valencia's own unique traditions date back to the 15th century and are centred in the neighbourhood of Cabanyal, formerly an independent fishing village. Especially noteworthy are the Good Friday morning processions, one of which involves carrying an image of the crucified Christ to the beach and back (departing at 09:00 from {{marker|type=around|name=Església de la Mare de Déu dels Àngels|lat=39.472480|long=-0.331994|image=Cabanyal, església de la mare de Déu dels Àngels.JPG}} and heading down Carrer del Pintor Ferrandis)."
"This small museum has exhibits explaining the Semana Santa Marinera traditions with costumes, documents, and photographs."
"Held annually since 1997, the two-day event includes exhibits, kite-making demonstrations, and competitions."
"The city has been celebrating Corpus Christi since the late 13th century, and holding feast day processions since 1355. All processions terminate at the cathedral; the tourist office can give a precise itinerary for each.<p>The main procession, known as the ''Cavalcada del Convit'' (Spanish: ''Cabalgata del Convite'') begins at 12:00 and follows an itinerary established in the 18th century, and features several medieval dances and rituals unique to Valencia. The most famous dance is ''La Moma i els Momos'', in which a man in white dress and white-veiled face is surrounded by seven men clothed and veiled in black; the dance represents the fight of virtue against the seven deadly sins. Also noteworthy is the dance of the ''Gegants'' (giants) and ''Nanos'' (dwarves), with dancers wearing oversized heads and costumes, and ''La Poalà'', in which participants are doused with buckets of water.<p>16:30 marks the start of the ''Pas de les Roques'' (Spanish: ''Paso de las Rocas'', or Parade of Carriages), the highlight of which are the antique horse-drawn carriages. The final procession, the ''Solemne Processó'' (Spanish: ''Solemne Procesión'') begins at 19:00, with participants from parishes and guilds followed by biblical characters and finally by the monstrance."
"The horse-drawn carriages used in the Corpus Christi parades, known as ''roques'' (Spanish: rocas, or 'rocks'), have been stored in this building since the mid-15th century. Eleven carriages are on display, the oldest of which was built between 1373 and 1392. Other items exhibited are costumes and historic documents, as well as a 25-minute video about the processions (in Spanish)."
"Held annually since 1871, this month-long festival includes daily free and ticketed music and dance performances in parks and plazas, open-air cinema, sporting events, and fairground rides. Every Saturday at midnight there are large fireworks (locations vary). The mid-month ''Gran nit de juliol'', always on a Saturday, features street parades and free outdoor concerts, and most museums remain open until midnight or 02:00. The tourist office can offer a detailed schedule of all events."
"The highlight of the July festival, the 'Battle of the Flowers' was first established in 1891. This unusual event begins with a parade of horse-drawn floats, on which are perched falleras in traditional dress. The floats circle around a closed off section of the avenue four times, and prizes are awarded for the most beautiful float. Then the fun begins: mountains of softball-sized marigolds have been distributed around the ring, and seated audience members proceed to pelt the falleras with the flowers, who defend themselves with tennis rackets and/or hurl flowers back into the audience. After the parade, the general audience is allowed into the ring, and a general melee begins."
"This annual public holiday has been celebrated since 1365 and commemorates the date in 1238 when King James I of Aragón entered the city, freeing it from Moorish rule. Festivities commence at midnight on 8 October with a fireworks display from the Túria River park by the Pont de l'Exposició (by Alameda metro station). At noon on the following day a formal procession carries the Valencian flag from the Ayuntamiento (City Hall) to the Parque del Parterre (Parterre Park), where a wreath is laid before the equestrian statue of King James.<p>The highlight of the day is the parade of '''Moros i Cristians''' (Spanish: ''Moros y Cristianos''), which commences near the Parque del Parterre and proceeds down Carrer de la Pau and Carrer de Sant Vicent, finally terminating at Plaça de l’Ajuntament. The parade starts at 17:00 but it is best to find a spot about a half-hour before the parade begins.<p>The 9th of October is also the day of St. Dyonisius, which for Valencians is similar to Valentine's Day. In a tradition dating to the 18th century, it is customary for men to give their sweethearts a ''mocaorà'' – a small bundle of marzipan treats shaped like fruits and wrapped in a handkerchief."
"Designed by José María de Paredes and opened in 1987, this is considered to be one of Europe's most important concert halls. The building is marked by an enormous glass greenhouse-like structure which also serves as the main entrance. In addition to classical music, jazz concerts are also performed here."
"This opera/concert house has four halls and covers an area of 37,000m². A schedule of events can be found [http://www.lesarts.com/agenda/ here]."

On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays performances begin at 23:00 and last for one hour; on Sunday they begin at 20:00. As shows are very popular, it is advisable to get there at least an hour before the show in order to secure a seat – getting to the door 15 minutes before opening is even better."
"Designed by Valencian architect Santiago Calatravato to resemble a giant eye, this building functions as an IMAX and 3D cinema as well as planetarium. Multiple films are screened daily, with a schedule available online. For visitors interested in seeing the inner workings of the building, guided tours are available M-F at 12.00 and 16.00 in Spanish and English. The building also has a restaurant and shop."

"A great school where you can take 4–6 hours of courses a day. All courses including beginner courses are taught entirely in Spanish."

The school provides the students with lots of leisure time activities and even housing can be arranged by the school, either in a studio, in a shared apartment or in a guest family. Even the beginner courses are taught entirely in Spanish, which makes it difficult to follow the lessons in the beginning."
"Organizes Spanish courses for foreigners, using the immersion method. The school is based in a real Spanish villa close to the old town of Valencia. Here, you can enjoy your classes, lounge on one of the terraces or study in the garden."

"Designed by Valencian architect Melchor Escrig Salvador in the mid-19th century, this unique building was constructed around a round plaza, and was noted by Valencian novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez in his novel ''Arroz y Tartana''. The building was recently completely renovated and now is home to a number of shops for traditional crafts as well as tapas bars. On Sunday mornings it is home to a flea market."
"Located in a newly-restored modernist iron and glass building dating from 1928, this is one of the largest markets in Europe. See how the locals shop for food and buy some fantastic fresh produce, meat, seafood, or olives."

"This small sidewalk eatery is known throughout the city for its excellent ''tortillas de patatas'' in a number of flavours, many of them vegetarian. Tortillas can be eaten either with a fork (''pincho'') or in a sandwich (''bocadillo''). Meatballs (''albondigas'') are also served here, but the real draw is the tortillas."
"Situated one block away from the beach (and without the view), this restaurant serves better food for much more reasonable prices than those places along the beach. The specialty here is pizza; the tapas and sandwiches are equally tasty."
"This is a very popular lunch spot for delicious and cheap bocadillos. Their signature bocadillo is the ''Super Bombon'', piled high with steak, jamón, lettuce, dressing, and french fries. The ''Bombon'', which omits the french fries, is a slightly lighter version. Getting a table requires some patience, or reservations."
"This is a very popular place for almuerzo (late breakfast / early lunch), and is especially known for its very large bocadillos. No reservations are accepted, but it's worth the wait for a table."

"This is a very popular, informal Andalusian-style tapas bar, in a pleasant plaza right by one of the few trees in the barrio. The tapas portions are large."
"This tiny but very popular tapas bar is known for its ''sardinas'' (grilled sardines), served with garlic infused olive oil and white bread. Other specialties include ''champiñones a la plancha'' (grilled mushrooms) and ''gambas al ajillo'' (garlic prawns). The place only has a handful of tables with additional seating at the bar, and tends to get very packed after 21:00."
"This tapas bar is named after the neighbouring ''La Casa Más Estrecha'', which, at a mere 107 cm wide, is listed in the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as the narrowest house in Europe (only the facade remains, as the interior of the house has now been annexed to the bar. The bar is a good bit wider, but still small enough that most seating is outside. Despite its location in a tourist area it is popular with locals, and serves a good selection of wines and beers, agua de Valencia, along with a range of traditional and creative tapas."

"Offers a very rewarding full day excursion to the Palladian Brenta Villas from March to October. The Burchiello was a typical Venetian barge, finely wrought and decorated, used to transport passengers and equipped with a wide wooden cabin, and three or four balconies. It was used by the richest classes of Venice to reach the city from their villas in the countryside. Today the Burchiello is a modern and comfortable boat, equipped with a cabin and comfortable sofas, air-conditioning, a bar and toilets, and a panoramic deck. Il Burchiello offer navigation from Padua to Venice (Padua, Stra, Dolo, Mira, Oriago, Malcontenta, Fusina, Venice) or from Venice to Padua (Venice, Fusina, Malcontenta, Oriago, Mira, Dolo, Stra, Padua), plus the guided tour inside some Venetian Villas, the famous richly-frescoed summer dwellings of the Venetian noblemen of the 1700’s."
"Offers free walking maps and brochures, and can help with hotel reservations."
"Yet another patchwork of architectural styles, but predominantly Gothic. None of the original construction remains, the oldest extant sections are the thirteenth century Giant Gate (''Riesentor'') and Towers of the Heathens (''Heidentürme''), both of which are Romanesque. In 1511, building in Gothic style ceased due to being out of fashion. The main altar has a Baroque panel showing St. Stephen, Christianity's first martyr. The organized tour is worth it, since some of the finest works of art in the cathedral can only be seen with a guide, such as Emperor Frederick III's red marble sepulchre and the immense Gothic carved Altar of Wiener Neustadt."
"The 137m-high tower, often known by its Viennese diminutive ''Steffl'' (also a nickname for the entire cathedral), was finished in 1433. 347 steps lead to the Türmerstube and to a good view."
"Steffl's intended twin, this tower was never finished. Over fifty years later, in 1579, a Renaissance spire was added to the Nordturm to make it look less like the builders had stormed off the job. This is where the ''Pummerin'', a huge bell cast from melted-down Turkish cannons, hangs. The aborted tower has an observation deck with an amazing view of downtown Vienna."
"Legions of bishops and Habsburg body parts are buried here (the intestines, specifically)."
"Displays the most precious objects from the cathedral's treasury."
"For an unusual perspective of the cathedral, consider taking a 90-minute guided tour of the roof."
"Located underneath the Kapuzinerkirche, this mausoleum houses the tombs of generations of Habsburg royalty."
"Has one of the most elaborate Baroque interiors in Europe."
"Believed to be the oldest church in Vienna, although recent excavations around the foundations of two other churches (Stephansdom and Peterskirche) have challenged this view. Earliest mention of the church in historical records is in 1200; the current structure dates from the Romanesque period, while the interior was renovated during the Baroque era."
"The church is believed to date back to the Middle Ages, and recent excavations suggest that the foundation may be far older than previously believed. The current structure was built during the Baroque period, and most recently restored from 1998-2004. There are regular organ concerts at 15:00 (free)."
"This gothic church was used by sailors on the Danube river. Its name refers to the former location near the river. Communion celebrations are held in German, French, and Czech."
"This trio of museums includes the '''Imperial Apartments''' (''Kaiserappartements''), '''Sisi Museum''', and '''Imperial Silver Collection''' (''Silberkammer''). The Imperial Apartments and Sisi Museum include 22 state rooms of the residential and state apartments of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth (popularly known as Sisi) and show 19th-century imperial life. The Imperial Silver Collection displays unique items of the glittering world of imperial dining."
"The best part of the Hofburg and an absolute must. It contains the Habsburgs' collection of jewels, crowns, and other valuables, perhaps the best on the Continent. Second only to a tour of the Kunsthistorisches Museum itself, of which the Schatzkammer is officially a part. There are 20 rooms of priceless treasures that give a fairly accurate representation of the ceremonial Habsburg court life over the centuries."
"The newest and largest section of the Imperial Palace. It contains the Welt Museum Wien, the Papyrus Museum, and three branches of the Museum of Fine Arts."
"Contains classical art from Ephesus, in Asia Minor."
"The jewel of the New Palace is the Collection of Arms. This collection, second largest in the world, houses an immense and exhaustive representation of weaponry from past centuries."
"One of the largest collections of its kind in the world, it includes nearly 180,000 manuscripts spanning 3,000 years of Egyptian history. 200 items are on permanent display."
"This collection encompasses many thousands of artifacts from across the globe. The most famous piece in its collection however is a headdress believed to have belonged to the last Aztec emperor Moctezuma."
"Card catalogs may be an anachronism in today’s digitized world, but this library had the first one in existence, invented by the Habsburg court librarian. Unlike the printed library catalogs of the past, bound into book form, the card catalog could be rapidly updated and the library kept up-to-date. This well-ordered reader's paradise has a collection that outshines many museums, thanks to its long association with the Habsburg imperial family. It gained an impressive collection when Emperor Josef II dissolved all the empire's monasteries – 300 manuscripts, 3,000 printed books, and 5000 diplomata. The library's collection is approximately six million items strong and is the largest in Austria. It is a pioneer in digitalizing and placing its collection online. The oldest book in the collection is a fifteenth century Holy Gospels manuscript with scenes representing the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) containing the coats of arms of the House of Austria, Styria, Tirol, and Carinthia, then ruled by Albrecht III, the book's owner."
"This magnificent historic library was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and built in 1726."
"The only museum of its type in the world, this museum contains a collection of 650 globes of all types, as well as a collection of nearly 300,000 historic maps."
"Founded in 1927, this museum houses a library and museum with displays illustrating the development and grammar of the modern invented language Esperanto."
"Once a palace, it is now the most popular exhibition space in Vienna, mainly for traditional modern art. The building itself is an experience as well. It is home to a valuable drawing collection, including many works of the German Renaissance painter, Dürer."
"Yet another example of the gruesome divide-and-conquer burial strategy of the Habsburg dynasty. It is said that other dynasties waged countless wars to acquire new lands, but ''you, happy Austria, marry''. Even in death, the Habsburgs placated three different churches with the honor of caring for their remains. The best known, the Kapuzinergruft, contains their actual bodies. St Stephens holds their innards (intestines and other parts taken out during the preservation process). But the Augustinerkirche holds, in the Herzgruft (Heart Crypt), all the Habsburgs' hearts. The tradition began in 1627 with Emperor Ferdinand IV, who wanted to ''lay his heart at the feet of the Mother of God'', literally. His heart, and those of his descendants, are preserved in silver jars which are carefully cared for by the Augustinian friars who run the church. When the renovation was underway it was found that the preservative in some of the caskets had evaporated over the years, leaving nothing but a dried-out, mummified heart."
"The original chapel of the Palace, built in Gothic style 1447-1449, was made over in Baroque style. On Sundays and Catholic holidays (of which the Austrians celebrate many), the Court Musicians perform here. This group is made up of members from the Vienna Boys Choir, as well as performers from the orchestra and choir of the Vienna State Opera."
"Was first mentioned in a document dated 1572 and is the only equestrian institute in the world which follows a Renaissance model of classical schooling. Eleves, or students, begin their training immediately after completion of Austrian primary education (age 15 or 16), and are expected to be both sporty and clever. The school takes its name from a Spanish breed of horse first mentioned in Roman writings. In 1562, Emperor Maximilian II brought some of these Spanish horses to Austria to found a royal stud farm in Kladrub (Bohemia), housing them for a time in the ""Stallburg"" (oldest section of the Imperial Palace). The present school location was built in 1572. In 1580, Maximilian's brother, Archduke Karl, founded the stud farm in Lipizza near Trieste (now Slovenia). Interest in elegant riding had been growing for about fifty years at that point. During Renaissance times, powerful gentlemen who had already conquered the worlds of finance and politics looked to the writings of antiquity for new learning and an educated lifestyle to which they could aspire. Horsemanship which followed the ancient models described by Socrates and others became the fashion. Xenophon (430 – 354 BC) wrote ""Men who understand the art of horsemanship, in truth, look magnificent."" Who wouldn't want that? In the new Winter Riding School (built 1729-35), tournaments, masked balls, and other entertainment was held, but this would soon draw to a close – the royal stud farms at Lipizza were threatened by Napoleon several times and twice the precious stud horses were evacuated to Hungary. No photos or video taping allowed."
"A tropical greenhouse with an amazing collection of live butterflies, will delight both children and adults."
"One of the world's greatest art museums and in a palace that is a work of art itself. Serious art fans may wish to devote more than a day to its treasures. There is no other word to describe the ''Kunst'' other than mind boggling. It contains a world-class exhibit of the Habsburgs' art collection, including Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, Bosch, and Brueghel. The Museum has an excellent collection of ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art. The coin & medals collection is also exhaustive in its scope. The Museum cafe is a bit pricey, but good, and in a beautiful setting. Hand-held photography is permitted."
"This museum was erected as a mirror to its twin museum, the Museum of Fine Arts. It exhibits various minerals, meteorites, fossils, stuffed animals, and skeleton reconstructions of dinosaurs and other. It also includes an anthropological section, where you can see the beautiful Venus of Willendorf which is 25,000 years old. Most signs and explanations in the museum are only in German, and you will likely receive little sympathy for this from museum staff. Expect museum guards to rush you out at least 15 minutes before closing time."
"This Baroque palace was originally built as a residence for Prince Eugene of Savoy, and later used for the Court Treasury and Ministry of Finance. It now houses period furnishings and exhibits detailing the biography of the prince and the history of the palace."
"The museum has the MAK Design Shop and a study collection. The museum exhibits contemporary art, design, and architecture."
"This is a relatively new and special museum devoted to an interactive learning experience. It covers the history of the Vienne Philharmonic Orchestra, the history of Vienna as a centre of music making (Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler, Schubert and others are documented). In addition there are the more experimental sections of futuristic composition (The Brain Opera) and sound experiences."
"A nice, small picture gallery mainly of Baroque Austrian painting."
"A gallery owned by the Academy of Fine Arts, to which Hitler applied to before he decided to change to politics. It offers some paintings by Rubens and Bosch. Most interesting are the Renaissance and medieval exponents."
"At the post office of his original design. At this museum you can see the more serious aspect of his artistic enterprise, that of public life. At the museum you can see some of the original furniture as well as his plans."
"A cinema for showing specially curated films and retrospective."
"A collection of 3000 clocks of all types, including a prized 18th-century astronomical clock."
"This venue hosts special exhibits of internationally-renowned artists; past exhibits have displayed work by Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka, Cézanne, Picasso, and Van Gogh."
"An unusual museum dedicated to the work of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism (''Wiener Schule des Phantastischen Realismus''), highlighting works by artists Ernst Fuchs, Arik Brauer, Rudolf Hausner, Wolfgang Hutter and Fritz Janschka. An extra section of the museum displays paintings by international artists, and the first floor is devoted to rotating special exhibits."
"A collection of liturgical implements, illustrated manuscripts, altarpieces, and sculptures."
"Housed in the Baroque Lobkowitz Palace, this museum displays stage models, costumes, and props, with special temporary exhibits."
"Hosts special exhibits of contemporary Austrian art."
"This 18th-century building is located atop the Mölker Bastei, one of the only remaining sections of the old city wall. For 8 years Beethoven lived in a 4th-floor apartment in this building, where he composed his 4th-8th symphonies as well as his opera ''Fidelio''. The museum preserves many of the composer's personal effects, and displays documents illustrating his life and work."
"A museum documenting the history of Vienna's substantial Jewish community which included Zweig, Freud, Herzl, Mahler, and Schoenberg. Three sites are available for one combined ticket: two museum sites and the main synagogue. Attached to the museum at Judenplatz are the archaeological remains of a medieval synagogue. The ''Stadttempel'', the only historical synagogue in Vienna to have survived World War II, is accessible on through the guided tour."
"A second branch of the Jewish Museum on Dorotheergasse. Underneath the Judenplatz (The Jewish Square) is an underground medieval synagogue excavation. Amazingly, the synagogue was destroyed centuries ago, but its existence was remembered by the area's inhabitants up to the 20th Century."
"A well preserved 19th-century synagogue, which is being used as the main city's synagogue by the current growing Viennese Jewish community."
"Archeological excavations carried out between 1989 and 1991 revealed not only the foundations of medieval buildings but also remains of the Roman canabae (civilian support settlement) of Vindobona, as Vienna was then known. The viewing area was designed by Viennese architect Hans Hollein."
"This is the Viennese residence of Austria's most famous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and a branch of the Vienna Museum."
"The oldest secular wall paintings known in Vienna, in a 14th-century building. The frescoes were commissioned in 1398 and illustrate scenes from the life and poetry of the Viennese minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental."
"This museum houses a collection of artifacts from the Roman settlement of Vindobona, as Vienna was then known. There are Roman ruins in the cellar of the museum itself, first discovered during construction work in 1948, and for many years only accessible to the public via a narrow staircase, before the building was transformed into a full-fledged museum 2008."
"Early Roman ruins from Vienna's earliest days as a Roman fort, located in the basement of the Fire Brigade Building."
"A 13th-century subterranean chapel located beneath the former Chapel of St Mary Magdalene (no longer standing, but outlines have been traced on the pavement directly south of Stephansdom). This chapel served as the tomb for a wealthy Viennese family and was completely forgotten until construction of the underground in 1975."
"A public space in front of the Neue Hofburg, setting to a number of important historic events, most notably of Adolf Hitler's 1938 announcement of the Austrian Anschluß. Two 19th-century equestrian statues portray Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen and Prince Eugene of Savoy."
"The remaining midsection of a medieval nail tree (Nagelbaum). Over the centuries hundreds of nails have been hammered in both in thanksgiving and for good luck. The tree figures in a number of local legends."
"The home of the two houses of Austrian Parliament. The building was designed by Theophil von Hansen in the Neoclassical style, and constructed between 1873 and 1883. [https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/GEBF/FUEHRUNGEN/index.shtml Guided tours] are offered in German or English."
"Architect Josef Maria Olbrich built this Jugendstil (German-style Art Nouveau) building 1897-98 as a display space for artists working in the new Secession artistic movement. It is topped by a giant, frothy golden ball, lovingly called ''Krauthappel'' by the Viennese, but the building was definitely not loved when it first opened. Notice a reactionary Viennese pattern here? The opera building too was hated at first, but at least it was not called a ''temple for bullfrogs'' or ''a bastard begot of temple and warehouse'' as the this building was. The entryway features the motto of the Secessionist movement: ''Der Zeit ihre Kunst, der Kunst ihre Freiheit'' (to the time, its art, to the art, its freedom). Olbrich's mentor Otto Wagner, and also Gustav Klimt, whose astounding ''Beethoven Frieze'' is partially preserved in the basement, inspired the building's design. The ceremonial front entrance is separate from the functional glass and steel exhibit hall in back."
"Designed by Friedrich von Schmidt (the architect of the Cologne Cathedral) and completed in 1883, this is the most significant neo-Gothic building in Vienna, with a 103m-high clock tower. There is a very pleasant park with two fountains in front of the building facing the Ring."
"A large 4m-diameter musical clock on a pedestrian bridge connecting two neighboring buildings. The clock was designed between 1911 and 1914 by the Judgenstil painter Franz Matsch, and features prominent figures from Viennese history, each with a Roman character. At noon all figures parade across the clock face, accompanied by music. During the Advent season, Christmas songs are played daily at 17:00 and 18:00."
"Designed by Adolf Loos and completed in 1909, this is considered to be one of the most significant buildings of the Wiener Moderne era from 1890-1910, although initially it was fiercely criticised. Today the building is occupied by the Wiener Raiffeisenbank, but a permanent exhibit in the building has photographs and documents illustrating the building's history."
"The university was founded in 1365, and is the oldest university in the German-speaking area, as well as one of the largest in Europe with more than 90.000 students. It consists of 15 faculties amongst them are Law, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology and Translational Studies. The main building (''Hauptgebaeude'') on the Ringstraße was designed by Heinrich von Ferstel, and formally inaugurated in 1884 by the Emperor Franz Joseph I. Guided [http://event.univie.ac.at/en/guided-tours/tours/ tours] are offered in German and English, featuring such highlights as the Main Ceremonial Chamber with copies of the ceiling paintings by Gustav Klimt, and the library's Great Reading Room."
"The Ringstraße circles the very heart of Vienna. Built on the location of the original city walls, its size is a good indication of how much the city has expanded since medieval times, but more importantly it is the most posh area of downtown. Elegant individuals stroll down the street (there really is no other way to move when walking along the Ring) and play the fashion-do/fashion don’t game under their breath before pausing at one of the innumerable cafes lining the way. A traditional Jause (morning coffee break, around 10:00) and then back to the business at hand, seeing and being seen: Vienna’s favorite pastime."
"Court painter Joseph Selleny and garden director Rudolf Siebeck designed this kind of artificial park with several small landscapes. It opened on the 21st of August 1862. One can finds in it the golden statue of Johann Strauss, which is most frequently photographed monuments in Vienna. You can also find the monuments of Franz Schubert, Franz Lehár, Robert Stolz and Hans Makart. The park is very frequently visited by locals and tourists."
"The park is symmectric with a big square in the middle in front of the city hall. The park has on each grassy side a varied selection of woody plants a Japanese pagoda tree or umbrella tree and an old ginkgo."
"The park is famous for the big variation of beautiful roses and features old platanes. There is a monument for Empress Elizabeth and in the middle a neoclassical Theseus temple."
"It has the form of an English garden, and located directly adjacent to the Hofburg. One finds a statue of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In the summertime students like to hang out in middle of the trees."
"Probably the most-beloved symbol of Viennese arts, and one of the first buildings to be rebuilt in the postwar era. It was built from 1861-1869 under the direction of architects Eduard van der Nüll and August von Siccardsburg for then-emperor Franz Josef I. The first performance was ''Don Giovanni'', an opera by Austrian native Mozart, on 25 May 1869. The architecture of the opera was barely tolerated by the picky Viennese when it opened. Van der Nüll did not take these criticisms of his work lightly and committed suicide. A few weeks later, von Siccardsburg died of a heart attack. Doubly cursed, the opera building succumbed to bombs less than 100 years later, during WWII. After ten years of Allied control after the end of the war, many cultural institutions reopened to celebrate the birth of the new Austrian state. This time the opera opened with an adopted son of Vienna's work: Beethoven's ''Fidelio''. The lush curtains and overall elegance contribute to the atmosphere (even the nosebleed seats, so steeply pitched and close to the ceiling a nosebleed becomes a distinct possibility). Inexpensive standing room tickets are made available for every performance and sold the day of the performance. The line forms about two hours prior to the performance. Guided tours in a number of languages are offered. The line at the front side door forms about 1/2 hour before the tour."
"Considered one of the world's best orchestras, subscription tickets are notoriously difficult to get with a waiting list lasting up to 13 years. Individual tickets however are available in limited numbers online from the [http://www.musikverein.at/ '''Musikverein'''] (where performances take place) as well as at the ticket office."
"Home to the Vienna Philharmonic, and venue for a wide range of other classical music performances. Its largest hall, the ''Großer Musikvereinssaal'' (''Goldener Saal'') is considered to be one of the world's finest concert halls. For visitors wanting a closer look, daily 45-min [http://www.musikverein.at/fuehrungen/fuehrungen.php guided tours] are offered (entrance at Bösendorferstraße 12, €6/€4 adults/youth 12-16)."
"The building was completed in 1888 and is home to one of the most respected German-language theaters, as well as the second-oldest theater in Europe. Non-German speaking visitors will find the building itself worth visiting, as the foyer contains paintings by Viennese artists Gustav and Ernst Klimt, and Franz Matsch, which can be viewed with a tour."
"Performs live. The program features the most famous waltz and operetta melodies by ''the King of the Waltz'', Johann Strauss, Franz Léhar and opera aries by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is led by conductor Gert Hofbauer, is composed of 36 musicians and six international vocal soloists from Vienna’s largest orchestral societies. On 31 Dec and 1 Jan the orchestra also performs the traditional New Year's Eve and New Year's Day Concerts in the flower decorated halls at the Vienna Hofburg."
"Each day, weather permitting, you can watch an opera on a huge open-air screen. On another part of the square, there are plenty of food stalls (maybe a little overpriced) which offer Viennese, as well as international food. On pleasant summer evenings, the atmosphere can be quite relaxing."
"The Jazzclub features international Jazz artists. One can reserve seats in advance, which is recommended for special events. The bar offers good wine and some food too."
"The Jazzclub plays kind of old-men Jazz in a relaxed ambiance operating since 1972."

"A classic 70's theatre which hosts international films. They regularly play ""The Third man"" movie."
"The casino is located at Palais Esterhàzy, on the famous Kärtner Strasse near the Opera and is operated by state-owned Casinos Austria. In addition there are several poker casinos (e.g. Montesino) and many, many tiny slot-machine and betting places. The latter often occur in groups of three (because there is a legal limit on the number of slot machines per venue). They do not offer any glamor or flair and are best avoided by tourists."
"Austria's biggest boulder hall is located in the town center. One finds tons of boulder problems to solve. They offer courses for beginners and advanced. Can get crowded on after business hours."
"It has a small boulder place and some interesting structures to lead climb on."
"Every year from late January until the beginning of March a section of the park is transformed into an outdoor ice skating rink, with music. Ice skates can be rented directly onsite, and a baggage check is available. There are also a number of food and drink booths offering warm drinks including punch, mulled wine, and tea, as well as traditional Austrian food."
"This historic men's sauna was opened in 1889 and since then has been considered to be the premiere bathing spots of Vienna. Visitors have included Habsburg royalty as well as modern day celebrities."
"A major shopping artierial with mostly international chains."
"An up-scale shopping promenade, with many local specialties such as Wien Porzellan. A notable landmark is the Plague Column (''Pestsäule''), a memorial erected in 1693 commemorating one of the last major plague epidemics which swept through Vienna in 1679."

The store holds just about every kind of wine you can think of, and has a great selection of pastas, chocolate, and cheese. Also has a wide selection of coffee, their own is one of the most recognized in Austria."
"Its range is not as wide as that of Julius Meinl, but still better than that of a typical supermarket."
"The main auction site in Austria. Exhibits all sorts of furniture, art, jewelry, and much more. Highly recommended. There are several locations throughout the city, the main one being at Dorotheergasse 17 in the city center. The surrounding streets in this area offer a great many antique shops, where quality and prices tend both to be very high."
"Jakob Heinrich Köchert founded the jewellery in 1814 in collaboration with the artistic French goldsmith Emanuel Pioté. The high end jewellery is dedicated to the fine art of goldsmithing and gemstone."
"The famous Viennese tailor's house provides the finest bespoke suits since 1858. If you're looking for traditional apparel like a smoking jacket, this is the place to have it custom tailored.

"The place sells classy high end Italian espresso machines and self-imported coffee from small Italian roasteries."

"The place started with original crepes and now mostly serves good Curry. The owner previously founded the Salon Wichtig next the Technical University. Home-made pastry and coffee is sold too."
"Good for veggies and meat eaters alike. Maschu Maschu is an Israeli fast food joint that serves some of the best falafel in the world. A healthy and gut busting falafel and beer should cost around €7 and leave you set up for the day (they also serve a wide range of other Middle Eastern meals)."
"NIG is the Neues Institutsgebäude - a University of Vienna building. During the summer you can sit outside and enjoy the sun. You have a nice view over the roofs of Vienna."
"Fast food versions of local food. Not bad if you are on a budget and do not have much time to spare."
"The snack bar sells small breads (''Brötchen'') with specific spread (''Aufstrich''). One has many choices including vegetarian. The place is very full at lunch time, but the queue advances quickly. They only use organic eggs. The smallest possible beer (''Pfiff'') is available, otherwise they sell excellent fruit juices too. One eats either standing next to a table or on the go."
"Part of a local chain. Non-smoking. Informal and popular place serving generic but reasonably priced Japanese and Korean dishes. The menu has a vegetarian section. Quick service by efficient waiters."
"A very nice restaurant with a cellar dating back to the 17th century. The furniture consists of parts from three centuries. A place that deserves the label ''gemütlich''. They play classical music and serve some really unique dishes."
"Really nice organic vegetarian and vegan restaurant and bar with colourful decor. A great place for those who want to sample traditional Viennese food like Wiener Schnitzel but in meat free versions. Has a good range of organic beers and wines."
"Stonebaked pizzas are served in a relaxed atmosphere."
"Famous for Wienerschnitzel. They claim to have the biggest schnitzel in the world. If you are not really hungry, one may easily be enough for two people (just ask for a second plate). Traditionally, you would want a potato salad with that."
"Modern and diverse cuisine, not crowded but most visitors are local. Charming modern interior instead of imperial chic. Overall, a rare combination of features. Menu has equal parts for vegetarians and carnivores. Friendly to families with toddlers. Almost non-smoking. Staff speaks only basic English. Great bulghur here."
"Fine French Provencal-style fare with a communal table at the center and a smoking section only at the back, goat cheese salad is highly recommended (€6,90)."
"Part of a world-wide but small chain which has several branches in Vienna. The one on Wallnerstrasse is full service. Authentic Middle-Eastern restaurant serving mostly Turkish and Greek dishes with some Viennese daily specials. Good place for both meat-eaters, for the kebabs, and vegetarians, for the many Middle Eastern salads."
"Good value for money, great ambience with imperial decor. Large mains served with a bowl of salad included. Very high ceilings, full of air and palms. Friendly staff speaks fluent English. Children-safe wide couches. Consider seating at elevated Mezzanine (reservation recommended) which has a special view over park. On warm days one can sit outside."
"A wonderfully creative and fresh soup and salad joint with a weekly rotating menu and take-away. Standing room only."
"One of the better traditional Beisl restaurants, with old fashioned food priced below comparable places. Daily specials usually include a couple of vegetarian options. Good non-smoking section."
"Small excellent restaurant/Beisl. The lunch menu changes daily and offers Viennese and Mediterranean food. After work and during dinner time Pastrami, Pulled Pork and other sandwiches are served. Fabulous home made desserts. Beer on tap, wines by the glass, home made lemonade. 25 seats indoor, 12 seats outdoor. English spoken."
"An Italian place serving good mostly authentic Italian food."
"The Vietnamese restaurant offers lots of vegetarian choices. Their vegetables are well prepared using good herbs combinations."
"A bourgeois Viennese restaurant offering good seasonal local food. In summertime one can nicely sit outdoor."
"Belongs to a famous winery Artner. It offers creative, fresh fare that tends to be on the lighter side than most Austrian cuisine. Excellent wine cellar, reservations recommended."
"The restaurant since 25 years serves excellent food with Viennese charme and a big wine choice. It has one Michelin star."
"The big lunch room in the Hotel Bristol reopened with the original art déco chandeliers and decorated ceiling. The restaurant may serve as elegant after Opera dinner."
"Sushi bar popular with business travellers. Serves fresh and tasty fish that comes at a high price."
"Italian fish restaurant combined with bar/lounge for Vienna's glitterati. Quality is excellent."
"The gourmet restaurant is handled by 2 Michelin starred Silvio Nickol. It offers 5, 7 or 9 courses menu. The seasonal wine card is exquisite."
"A very nice restaurant that specializes in beef (claimed to be only local and from trusted farmers) and has some flavour of traditional Austrian cuisine. Try the ''Tafelspitz'', it comes in a copper pan and still is in the soup it was cooked (the soup alone is worth a trip to Vienna). Alternatively, try the ''Backhendl''. The chef claims that they prepare more than 100 kg of beef each day. Probably three to five waiters will be at your disposal. Reservations recommended."
"Excellent northern Italian fare with a range of fine specialties. Slightly small portions but an extensive wine list to drown this particular sorrow in. Reservations recommended."
"The restaurant offers a menu with freshly cooked organic ingredients – from the classic Wiener Schnitzel to Chocolate-Almond-Cake without flour and Bio-Fruit-Ice-Cream."
"The Japanese cook Hiroshi Sakai once governed this place that serves authentic Japanese food. One dines on the top floor of a splendid Viennese palace, that is nowadays the Grand Hotel. It has an excellent choice of special wines. The restaurant is awarded with Gault-Millau caps."
"Viennese bourgeois restaurant cooked by Christian Domschitz."
"This hidden gem features Italian food. One may sit outside in the small pedestrian street."
"Maybe the most popular place. You can choose from a lot of different flavors, but it's always crowded and you often have to stand in a queue for a few minutes."
"Another excellent and popular ice cream parlour. Ask for the Special Nougat ice cream."
"A small new ice parlour, that is being overrun by customers since its opening in 2011. They sell excellent organic ice cream, made from milk of their own organic milk farm and without artificial flavours. It is worth the wait in the queue."
"The Italian ice cream shop produces on the spot their own with exquisite ingredients like piemontese hazelnuts, caramelised pine nuts or fresh fruits."
"In the same district as Eissalon. Popular with Viennese and tourists for its huge €2 cones to go."
"Thomas Bernhard used to come here daily as do many other Viennese literate. It exists since more than 35 years. Happily expect Viennese grumpy senior waiters."
"One of most famous Vienna coffee houses, which opened in 1876, recently authentically restored. Beautiful premises inside the Palais Ferstel, it is too touristy and a bit more expensive for having a meal, but can be worth it for a cup of coffee. There is an occasional pianist that is delightful to hear, and a good non-smoking section."
"Famous traditional coffeehouse, and equally good place for having a meal. They opened a second branch on Fleischmarkt."
"This traditional café already existed at the times of Mozart and Beethoven. It serves Viennese food."
"A very traditional Viennese café, hence visitors take their time to enjoy the lovely cakes."
"An elegant café/restaurant where you also get warm food for lunch. Smoking is banned from this traditional coffee house."
"One of the most famous ''intellectual'' cafes in Vienna. Established in 1939. Surprisingly cheap for its location and its fame and can get quite cozy. Josephine Hawelka (former owner, deceased 2005) was proud of the marriages she caused by placing random people together at tables. Try the Buchteln. Usually quite smoky."
"Old café, cozy and romantic. Used to be frequented by Sigmund Freud. Delicious food and desserts."
"This cafe was designed by famous architect Adolf Loos, however the interior has been entirely refitted (most recently from 2010, its 80s atmosphere is now gone). Serves food as well as coffee, teas, and other drinks. Casual, quiet atmosphere, good non-smoking section."
"Established in 1903. Quite the hang-out in the evening, during the day this cafe is a bit more laissez-faire."
"The Café Sacher, directly in front of the Opera House, of course serves the famous cake ''Sacher Torte''."
"The Sacher bar next to their shop is on the Corner of Kärtner Strasse and is a bit less formal than the traditional café. Still on rush hours expect some waiting time to get seated in order to be able to order the ""Sacher Torte""."
"Beautiful traditional Viennese café with view on the Schwarzenbergplatz and the Ring avenue. It has fine pastries and coffee choices."
"Quaint, traditional café with art deco accents. Established in 1900."
"A very traditional small Viennese café, opened at the end of the 19th century by Josef and Josefine Sluka, serves excellent pastries and bread. To the breakfast one can order oeuf poché. The choice on the menu is adjusted according season. Free Wi-Fi is available. The place is non smoking and in summer time one can sit outside."
"Café and confectionary shop. Good pastries are ubiquitous in Vienna, but Demel is considered by many to have the best of all and indeed was once the pastry caterer to the Imperial household. As a result of this it is usually jammed with tourists, though their amusing marzipan display window can be admired even from the street. Outdoor seating in warm weather, but the inside is more atmospheric. Partly smoke-free."
"As the name suggests, this café is rather small. It was created by architect Hermann Czech during the 1970s for notable Austrian actor Hanno Pöschl, who still owns it. It is a popular meeting place for artists and actors (or would-be variants) and enjoys an excellent location in a quiet square inside the city. The few seats are often occupied but hang around and they are vacated regularly. Seating on the square in fine weather, a bit smoky at peak times."
"A brewery and a bar with quality beers. The food menu includes Viennese classics and burgers. A non-smoking area upstairs (which hence doesn't fully stop smoke)."
"This cafe/restaurant/bar is on a very medieval-looking lane in the central district and is a time warp of another kind: its folky-bohemian atmosphere could convince you you're in North Beach or Greenwich Village, circa 1967. Liveliest late."
"Special establishment where the time stood still."
"The bar serves classical cocktails."
"You have not been to Vienna if you have not been to the Flex, particularly if you are younger than thirty. The meeting point of the off-mainstream, bohemian, artsy people. During the summer nights when it is warm, there are always a lot of people sitting on benches outside the club. It's easy to socialise and make new friends. Inside the club you can enjoy bands and DJs. At the bar you can ask for free soda water."
"Built in 1908, this small bar was designed by Adolf Loos and inspired by his stay in the US from 1893-1896, and will delight fans of Art Deco. Famous for its architecture and interior decoration, it is a time warp of Vienna from 1908 when it opened. Drinks are expensive, but very good and the price is worth the experience. This is a quiet, sophisticated bar, where boisterous behavior or very casual dress will not be appropriate. Usually smoky due to small size. There is outdoor seating in warm weather but there is not much point in using it since what justifies the prices is the interior. Groups and sight-seers are not admitted."
"The former chief bar keeper of the Loos Bar, Roberto Pavlovic opened a new American bar. It serves between 16–18 aperitifs and between 16–20 Champagne price is reduced. 200 cocktails to choose from. Beware smoking is permitted."
"The place is specialised on Carinthian drinks and food. Speck in all kinds is served. Carinthian noodles and Schnaps are recommended too. The bar is just hidden behind the Viennese university."
"A night-life area popular for young people as the alcoholic beverages are cheap."
"An upscale club."
Up-market.
"An orange boat. All sorts of [https://www.facebook.com/badeschiff.at/events? events and parties] go on here, and in summer you can take a dip in the outdoor [http://www.badeschiff.at/#baden pool-barge] during the day. There is a lower level that is the main club at big parties and a more comfortable lounge upstairs."
"A family run guest house for budget travellers with free Wifi internet and breakfast."
"Small pension. Good breakfast, very friendly to families with toddler (except a small staircase prior to elevator). Free grog for guests in the afternoon. Free excellent wifi in all rooms. Helpful reception most of the time, also in finding a right place to eat. Comfortable for non-smokers."
"Three star hotel, pets permitted, free wi-fi, non-smoking."
"Boutique hotel. Only 25 rooms, contemporary design, gourmet breakfast."
"Built in 1863 as a Viennese residence for the German Prince of Württemberg in neo-Renaissance style. In total imperial style and impeccable service."
"A converted historic building that now has an outstanding restaurant (perfect wine list) and spa. Beside some rooms mostly suites and impeccable service."
"This hotel is best known as the place where Sachertorte (cake) was invented. The elegant drawing room is a popular place to gather after a performance at the opera. The food is pricey but definitely worth the money. The rooms offer old style luxury with heavy carpets."
"Opened in late 2003 and is done in a very modern, artsy ''Art + Tech'' design. All rooms have flat screen TVs and massage showers. Features a breakfast buffet and bar."
"In June 2014 opens this Hotel in the more than 100 years old bank headquarter building in the very center of Vienna. It has 143 guestrooms including 35 suites. It hosts an extensive fitness centre and guests can swim in the 15m pool located in the former vault of the bank."
"Casual luxury five star boutique hotel. Has an unexpected interior, which mixes the traditional with the modern. Many of the building's historic details have been preserved to ensure the hotel remains all of its historic charm."
"313 rooms and suites, an indoor pool and health club, business center and shops. The restaurants and bars are popular gathering places."
"Free Wi-Fi is available at the tourist information office. (See listing above under Understand.)"
"Both large VIP buses and mini buses leave to Vang Vieng from here. Mini vans will pick up passengers from hotels and bring them to this point. Avoid being picked up too early by walking to this location that's near to many guest houses and hotels."
"It's quite far from town which leaves you at the mercy of the tuk-tuks (starting from 15,000 kip if you are lucky). Public Bus 23 stops by the entrance of the southern bus station and connects it with the Talat Sao bus terminal (Morning Market) at 5,000 kip, from where it is a ten-minute walk into the tourist centre. Mind that the existence of the city buses is going to be vigorously denied by most people you ask, as many have stakes in passenger transportation, and want you to take their ride instead. Bus 29 goes to the center (3,000 kip, ~20 min)."
"This centre explores the Lao legacy of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and the National Rehabilitation Centre's efforts to expand prosthetic, orthotic, and rehabilitation services across the country. There are a number of exhibits and visitors can watch a number of short films on the subject. Exhibits are appropriate for all ages. An excellent gift shop offers fun, offbeat souvenirs that support a good cause. Free parking."
"Kaysone Phomvihane was the leader of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party from 1955. He served as the first prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic from 1975 to 1991 and then as president from 1991 until his death a year later."
"Formerly the Lao Revolutionary Museum. It should be rechristened the Lao Natural, Cultural, and Political Science and History Museum, the historical exhibits on the first floor are modest though very interesting in depicting some of the early history. They include one of the original jars from the Plain of Jars and various stone and Bronze Age implements. The second floor provides great insight into the 18th Century Laotian Kingdom and the customs of the day. It would appear that the Laotians did not treat their guests quite as well in those days, often keeping them from leaving the country for several months. The floor builds up to a fervently revolutionary pitch as it documents the heroic struggle of the Lao against the Siamese (Thai), French, and American imperialists. Exhibits include items such as socks worn by politburo members when they escaped from prison and Kaysone Phomvihane's chest expander. The final rooms, on post-revolutionary Laos, are mostly a photo gallery of pressing topics such as the comrades of the 7th Plenary Session of the Laos People's Congress inspecting fertilizer production processes. The final rooms provide an insight into some of the modern advancements, though these are fairly dowdy and uninspiring. Visitors are routed through the shop, and items look like they have been on sale since the revolution in 1975. A guestbook regularly features amusing arguments between young Western visitors on the merits of communism. Most exhibits are labelled in broken English, though some French labelling remains, occasionally to the exclusion of English."
"Displays the equipment and other items from the period of revolutionary struggle, 1950-1975."
"A local rendition of the ''Arc de Triomphe''. Besides having elaborate Buddhist embellishment, it differs from the original in having four gates instead of two and being just a bit higher to spite the French. Reasonably impressive from afar, a surprisingly frank English sign inside the monument labels it a ""monster of concrete"" when seen up close. The concrete was donated by the US, although it was supposed to go towards a new airport instead: hence the nickname ""the Vertical Runway"". The monument itself aside, the palm tree-lined park around it complete with fountains is quite pleasant though lacking of shade during the daytime. You can climb up to the 7th storey, stairs only, for a nice view of central Vientiane and three levels of souvenir shops with less than enthusiastic sales people sitting about. It features a musical fountain nearby that attracts visitors from around Laos and Asia, as well as a World Peace Gong presented by Indonesia. Roving cameramen will be happy to charge you for photos near these attractions."
"The mythical abode of a seven-headed dragon that protects Vientiane. It was renovated in 1995, but still has an attractive patina of age, and is slowly being overgrown again by lush grass vegetation. Take care as there have been dog attacks at night."
"A stunning, elegant, and majestic structure, King Setthathirat's former royal temple, which housed the magical Emerald Buddha (''pha kaew'') after it was taken from Lanna (Chiang Mai). The Siamese took it back in 1779, and is now housed in Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaew. Later the Thais returned in 1828 to raze the temple. The present structure is a 1942 reconstruction of dubious provenance. Today, the temple no longer operates and the interior has been turned into a small jumbled museum housing Buddha images. Look for the beautiful tall, lithe, long-armed Buddha in the hands-down ""calling for rain"" pose."
"The national symbol and most important religious monument of the country, That Luang is a three-layered gilded stupa. The current version dates from 1566, although it has been ransacked and renovated numerous times since then. Accessing the inner courtyard gives you a slightly closer view of the stupa, and lots of Buddha statues. Vientiane's most important festival, '''Bun That Luang''', is held here in Nov on the night of the full moon. There are two temples beside That Luang: '''Wat That Luang Neua''' (north) and '''Wat That Luang Tai''' (south), both currently being renovated."
"Given their location, the temples most likely to be visited by tourists."
"Disney-esque and gaudy in set-up, one would not think that it's a religious compound. Despite its small size, the temple is very active. Followers believe that lifting the small Buddha statue 3 times from its cushion means that your prayers or questions will be answered. The city pillar is being housed in a pagoda-like structure now being constructed separately on another block northwest across the street."
"With very contemplative ambience, probably the oldest standing temple in Vientiane and among the most atmospheric. Built in 1818 by Chao Anou in the Bangkok-style and hence left unsacked when much of Vientiane was razed in a Siamese raid in 1828. Within the cloister walls are hundreds of niches housing Buddha images large and small, made of wood, stone, silver and bronze. In the centre of the courtyard is a five-tier-roofed ''sim'' (ordination hall) housing yet more Buddha niches and beautiful, but fading murals of the Buddha's past lives."
"An outdoor collection of huge concrete sculptures of Buddhist and Hindu deities, and real and religious beasts. The reclining Buddha is especially impressive. The Park was built in 1958 by the mystic Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat. In 1978 he fled to Thailand, following the communist take-over and went on to create a larger version of the Park (''Sala Keoku'' or ''Sala Kaew Ku'') across the river in Nong Khai, Thailand. There are two travel options. Hire a taxi/tuk tuk from Vientiane, say 100,000 kip. The second, take a public bus. Bus #14 travels from the Khua Din (central Vientiane) station, past the Friendship Bridge, all the way to the Buddha Park for 6,000 kip, one-way. For your return there are always tuk tuks at the Park waiting for customers, or take the bus back. The last bus back to Vientiane departs from the park at 16:45. Entrance 5,000 kip, plus 3,000 kip per camera (phones free)."
"Here, typical houses of various ethnic groups are on display, though only from the outside unless you happen to meet some kind of custodian who will unlock some of them and show the inside. There also are some statues of dinosaurs and a rather dismal looking small ""zoo"". Most times the only activity seems to be the kiosks where they sell soft drinks and crisps/chips, but there are said to be occasional cultural shows. Tour operators often take their guests here before or after a visit to the Buddha Park. Not worth a trip."
"Has a French library and a small theatre that shows plays and films."
"This place may be the best salon in Vientiane."
"The national sport of Lao PDR. Similar to muay Thai, but is not a tourist trap unlike many gyms in Thailand."
"Peaceful Buddhist meditation centre with a daily schedule dedicated to sincere meditation practice. Foreigners welcome. Hard to find such a place elsewhere in Laos."
"Learn about Lao cooking and culture. Cook Lao-style in the garden on a quiet stretch of the Mekong River."
"This massage shop is particularly delightful. The massage parlour does not really have a name, and the most prominent sign merely says ""now open"". Your masseur or masseuse will be grateful for a tip. The staff will be happy if you have the decency to take a shower before you go. They won't say anything to your face, but smelly foreigners make their job less than pleasant."
"Once a month, local monks gather for chats with tourists."
"A local favourite. There are floating restaurants along the lakeshore; their specialty is fish fresh from the lake. Cruises among the lake's islands can be booked here, which makes for a relaxing couple of hours. Just enquire at your guest house/hotel or at any travel agency (where they will then try to sell their tours)."
"Vientiane ByCycle offers awesome guided bicycle tours through and around Vientiane. They take you off the beaten track to places where you usually would not go ordinarily. Along villages, temples, school yards, bank of Mekong River, crematoria, markets and local businesses. They have excellent quality mountain bikes."
"Explore the region with a good quality bicycle. Rent by the day or longer. Bikes are for sale and can be repaired too."
"A duty free, state-owned liquor store. Limited selection but the cheapest prices in town for popular brand name liquor by the bottle. This place is pretty good in terms of product authenticity but nothing is 100% guaranteed."
"Foreign exchange counters at various locations. This bank charges no commission, gives better conversion rates and has longer opening hours than most local banks."
"Vientiane's newest and privately owned bank and operates a currency exchange until about 20:30 on weekdays, and for shorter hours on weekends."
"Allows withdrawals of up to 2,000,000 kip per transaction with a 40,000 kip transaction fee. Supports both Visa and Maestro. There are 2 branches in Vientiane. The first is at the main ANZV office located mid-way down Lane Xang. There are now also various ANZV ATMs, for example on the corner of Fa Ngum Rd and Rue Chao Anou and at various minimarts, like the City minimart and at some M Point marts."
"Withdrawals are limited to 1,000,000 kip per transaction; however, you may make up to ten of these in one day. MasterCard and Maestro are accepted; Visa also. BCEL charges a fee of 20,000 kip per transaction."
"Possible to withdraw up to 1,000,000 kip per transaction with a 30,000 kip transaction fee. Supports both Visa and Maestro."
"The place to go if you want to buy a decent Western style bicycle or spare parts for one."
"Offers a good selection of English and French language books and magazines."
"Vientiane boasts one of the best DVD shops in Southeast Asia, with 10,000 titles of quality European, Asian and US movies. Seng Lao has dozens of books displaying DVD covers: you browse the books, and list your choices on a piece of paper they provide, at 10,000 kip each. The nearby and better-marked Seng Dao DVD shop has inferior service and choice. Mind the possible consequences of importing large amounts of illegally copied DVDs into your country."
"Silk and cotton weavings in both traditional and modern designs. A local magazine says ""phone before visiting, as there is no permanent staff."""
"Traditional Lao silk weavings, hand-woven fabrics, textiles and clothing using natural dyes."
"Naturally dyed textiles (mainly cotton) from the south (Savannakhet)."
"Founded 1990 by an American woman (Carol Cassidy), who now employs some 40 artisans, this firm offers modern cotton weavings using traditional motifs and. Some of their work has been exhibited in international museums, with this reflected in the price. They are not particularly welcoming to visitors, including a locked front door, a bell that needs to be rung to request entry and very prominent ""No photography"" signs."
"They weave handmade textiles of the shop's own design on the premises, and you are welcome to watch. Beautiful wall hangings, not the cheapest in town, but well worth the price. Also on sale are shirts and skirts, scarves, cushion covers and anything made of fabric."
"The sales outlet of a not-for-profit organisation that operates in about five hundred villages in Northern Laos, seeking to create income-generating opportunities. Naturally-dyed, handmade Lao silk products."
"Sells oils, shampoos, soaps, etc., made by ''Les Artisans Lao'' as well as honey and some nice handicrafts. Les Artisans Lao is a social venture allowing disadvantaged, uneducated and often marginalised people to receive apprenticeships."
"A Chinese-owned shop, offering good foreign exchange rates. Large one-stop shop for assorted products from stationery to housewares, clothing to luggage. Prices are fixed and reasonable."
"A large collection of indoor stalls selling, well, pretty much anything. There are two floors: the first floor sells mostly textiles, electronics (watch out as nearly all of them are counterfeit), and watches. The second floor has clothing, gold and jewellery. Depending on the product, you should negotiate. Discounts can vary from 10% to 33%."
"Has 3 floors and is the first public building in Vientiane with indoor parking. On weekends folks from the countryside come and marvel at the escalators (which, in one local magazine article, were referred to in English as ""electricity ladders""), and at the bravery of those who venture onto them. The mall boasts a few cafés and a Thai-style food court. The front side of the market has space for parking. The toilets are not far from the entrance and can be used for a very small fee. Many vendors are Thais so they expect you to pay in baht, despite the signs urging you to pay in kip, and they also expect you to be typical dumb tourists who'll pay any price and still think it's a bargain. Souvenir tee-shirts, three for 200 baht. Almost of products here are mentioned in many newspapers or fake product report sites."
"Maybe the shop with the most extensive range of merchandise in the town, and somewhat cheaper than the shops in the centre."
"A relatively new convenience store chain, with at least five locations in Vientiane. Much like a 7-Eleven. Stop by around 18:00 and there will be a Thai food cart right in front. Has the best pad Thai in town. You can choose from pad Thai, fried baby mussels, fried rice, and mixed seafood platter. 15,000 kip per plate."
"An almost a full-grown supermarket. This place will surprise you with the amount of Western stock it carries, but it is expensive, and the owners must make a nice profit on the exchange rate that they apply so it' advisable to pay in kip. A second shop with the same name (the owners are related, the shops are not) is on Samsenthai Rd / corner of Chantha Kumman Rd. Excellent, European-style bread is usually available (on Setthathirat), though the delivery schedule is a bit erratic."
"Outside in front is a small café where they serve some of the best coffee specialties in town ('''Lao Mountain Coffee'''), shakes, fruit juices, waffles, doughnuts. Good for people watching on the edge of the Chinese quarter."
"Dozens of unpretentious restaurants and beer gardens (those upstream from the main beach promenade are generally cheaper). All are pleasant places for a beer and a snack or a complete meal while the sun goes down over the river. One of these is one-time famous John's Restaurant, but since the owner married an Australian and left town there is nothing to distinguish it from the other places left and right. All serve inexpensive (but not really cheap for Laos) Lao, Thai, and some Western food. Among the best is the grilled fish, served by many of them. Take care when you're in for boiled eggs: what you get here are incubated duck eggs. When you open them you're in for a surprise (but at least the little bird does not chirp). The Lao love them and they are hugely popular. In 2005 one of the restaurants along the river put '''Lao-style''' reed mats on the ground with low rattan ""tables"" (''kantoke''). Diners sit cross-legged on the mat around the table. These became so popular that they can now be found at many of these establishments. They are much nicer than the rickety metal tables and plastic chairs that are the standard of all but the better restaurants in Laos. The riverside open-air restaurants have been known to use two menus, a cheaper one for locals and an expensive one for foreigners."
"Has some of the best cheap meals in the city despite being only about 1 block long. Starts setting up at sundown. There's a wide range of street snacks available, including pho made with hand pulled noodles, little lettuce-wrapped snacks with peanut filling (miang), all types of grilled skewered meats, grilled sticky rice, local beverages made from coconut, chai tea, cornm grass jelly and more. Particularly worth trying are the small rice pancakes, two hemispheres of rice-based batter fried in a tin, filled with minced pork and beansprouts and put together. About the size of a flattened tennis ball, absolutely delicious."
"For an authentic Lao dining experience there is this noodle soup shop. This restaurant offers the best Lao white thick slimy rice noodles with some pieces of chicken, fried pork, quail's eggs, etc., and the usual vegetable servings: spring onions, cilantro, mung bean sprouts (unlimited serve-yourself quantities). There is also ""kanom ku"" (Chinese doughnuts) on the side, served ready for pick on every table. Excellent value as it's all for 10,000 kip plus 1,000 kip per kanom ku consumed, on the honour system. Most importantly, the noodle soup tastes great, the broth is delicious."
"A small group of stalls offering local food patronized by office workers. The ambiance is similar to the morning and night street food markets in Luang Prabang and the vendors seemingly have not been adulterated by touristy mindset. At 09:30, flies hover rarely and the food is steaming hot, having just been lifted out of the cooking fire."
"Decent Indian food. Their toilet is not the cleanest in the country, perhaps because the patrons of some of the restaurants on the river bank are directed here for certain needs when they are not sent down to the reeds at the water's edge. Nazim has opened another branch in Pang Kham Rd, opposite the offices of Lao Airlines. There are at least 4 other Indian restaurants in the city centre, and all quite similar."
"They typically serve rice noodle soups (""feu"", a close cousin to Vietnamese phở and Chinese 粉 fan2), often also fried rice and other rice or noodle-based dishes."
"Serves delicious Philly cheesesteaks, kebabs and quesadillas. Baguettes are freshly baked each day, and sandwiches are given generous amounts of mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Middle Eastern options are accompanied by homemade tahini or tzatziki sauce. Also possible is a traditional family-style Thai feast. The quality of the food is rivalled only by the friendliness of the chef."
"Stay Hungry Burger's claim is true as you really do stay hungry after eating there: their burgers are the smallest in the city."
"Good Indian food at good prices if you don't mind listening to American pop music."
"Croissants and pastries, simple lunches and excellent baguettes. Tasty, not just something to chew. Their coffee is among the best in Vientiane, on a par with that at JoMa."
"Offers a wide range of reasonably priced Asian and European dishes. The owners are Lao, but speak fluent English, French and German. Daily specials and home roasted coffee beans, the basis for one of the best coffees in town. Busy at lunchtime, discounts after 14:00."
"Excellent homemade pasta and pizzas for around USD6-7, as well as a good selection of wines including by the glass."
"Authentic Vietnamese food. When there are more than just a few guests the kitchen staff may lose sight of their priorities."
"A favourite of the expat community, serving generous helpings of mainly French food."
"Has croissants and pastries and simple lunches. The owners of Le Croissant d'Or also run the Vista café on François Ngin Rd (free Wi-Fi when you spend 30,000 kip on food and drink)."
"Two different companies, on boats moored opposite Wat Chan and one 300 metres upriver. Not very impressive, neither the boat trip (1 hour, departure around 19:00, 1 km upstream then 2 downstream and back, only when the water level is high enough) nor the food. Very relaxing. This Lao maritime experience will cost you only slightly more than the same meal in one of the beer gardens on the riverbank."
"Nice interior with comfortable seating arrangements and relaxed atmosphere. Asian/European fusion cuisine. Friendly but unfocused staff and reasonable prices. Manager named Khamfanh speaks good English and can help with orders or information about Laos. Free book exchange. Free Wi-Fi."
"Bright, cheery, friendly place, perfect for a leisurely bite and beer in the shadow of the That Dam. Wholesome, healthy Thai-influenced food and fresh desserts. Good selection of vegetarian dishes."
"Meat offered at two levels of quality: Lao beef at around USD4-5; New Zealand lamb and beef at about USD8 and above. To be tried on a cool evening, the fondue bourguignon at USD26 for two, a surprise in a place whose name means ""sticky rice"". Excellent cheese fondue at USD28 for two. Not something for the hottest months of the year, but nice around year's end when temperatures drop."
"With the ongoing construction of the flood management levee and river park in Vientiane, this restaurant offers the most optimal dining views of the Mekong. Thai owned, it features an extensive menu of what is best termed Thai-Lao fusion. Not incredibly exciting food, but good, although portions are on the small side. Also, the staff will invariably mess up your order. Keep a close eye on the bill, as well, as items tend to make it on there that you didn't order."
"Thai food. A favourite among expats living nearby. Packed at lunch, the restaurant is known for its excellent Penang curry."
"Authentic Lao food with a good selection of vegetarian dishes. Traditional Lao music and dance performances in the evening."
"For decent Lao, Thai, and Western food in a charming environment, this is the place. Very popular with locals and with a great view of the Mekong. The fried fish laap is excellent. Often offers live music in the evenings. Meena Nightclub opposite is a fun place to dance the night away with locals after dinner."
"Serves traditional Lao and Western food."
"Training restaurant to give street kids skills in the hospitality industry. Excellent food and service. Inventive, interesting, well-presented, and expertly cooked modern Laotian food. Great alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Mushroom curry noodles and banana flower salad are both excellent."
"A very pleasant spot to eat excellent Lao food. A large place, an extensive menu, competent and friendly service. Background music not too loud."
"Part of a chain that also has restaurants in Thailand and Indonesia. Good Lao, Thai, Chinese, and Western food. Reasonable prices and good, attentive service. Very popular at lunchtime with office workers and students."
"French fare, excellent pizzas but the steaks sometimes leave much to the imagination. Main courses from about USD4-10."
"On that tree-shaded part of the river promenade that has not yet been upgraded to Lao-style sterile banality like the stretch downriver. It is about 0.3 km upstream from the end of the paved portion of the road. An excellent cocktail bar, it also offers a full breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu with competent and friendly service. Every evening there is 25% off all cocktails and a view of the sun setting on the Mekong. Watch the servers jump the puddles in the rainy season when you've chosen to sit outside on the terrace across the potholed road."
"High quality Western-style food at reasonable prices. They have won a national award for their grasshopper/cricket tacos. Also offer a wide selection of vegetarian options. There's happy hour on Wednesday and Friday nights, with half price cocktails. Open for breakfast and lunch on weekends only. Free Wi-Fi. Hangout for expats and NGO volunteers."
"Huge selection of excellent pizzas for around 45,000 kip. The mocha shakes are particularly tasty. Also has a wide variety of fresh baked breads, pastries and cakes."
"Popular with expats and tourists alike. It is one of the best French restaurants in Vientiane. Very good pizzas and excellent tender steaks for around USD5)."
"Offers a good selection of Lao BBQ dishes and soups as well as the usual rice dishes. The restaurant is just off the main road next to a large fishing pond surrounded by colonial houses, a welcome change from the busy riverfront. Good selection of beers and beverages also available. Popular with locals."
"Excellent wood-fired Italian style pizza and homemade pastas priced from USD4. Good selection of Belgian beers."
"Arguably the best French restaurant in town. Very inventive and especially tasty cuisine cooked up by Tinay, a French chef trained in Michelin starred restaurants in France. Delphine, Tinay's wife, will make you feel at home from the moment you step in. Mains start at USD10 with set menus for less than USD20. Highly recommended."
"Traditional Yugoslav and Mediterranean homemade dishes, prepared by Montenegrin chef."
"Good Western food."
"Excellent classical French fare. Booking is recommended."
"Good food and exceptional service. A favourite of NGO types."
"Good Italian food (but not quite comparable to what you get in the owner's home country). Good pizzas. Don't go there if you cannot stand opera music. It is played continuously in the background though not, fortunately, so loud that it drowns the conversation."
"Excellent Italian food. Romantic setting in a beautifully maintained colonial home. Offers a lunchtime buffet Monday-Friday. Tasty Neapolitan-style pizzas. Has an extensive wine list, and pasta mains are priced from USD8."
"A small atmospheric restaurant with excellent French food and a good wine list."
"Chinese vegetarian. The owner is Taiwanese, so this place seemed promising, as vegetarian cuisine is very popular in Taiwan, and done to an extraordinary standard. Unfortunately, that level of quality did not follow this owner into Laos. The food is lacklustre, and the management of the restaurant appears to suffer from neglect, possibly because the owner is rarely in Laos."
"If you are craving spicy Hunan fare, Dihao serves up some of the best you'll find this side of Changsha. Hunanese-owned and operated (the Hunan Chamber of Commerce is on the 4th floor), Dihao is likely the finest and most authentic Chinese restaurant in Vientiane at the moment. Staff speak Chinese and Lao, and the menu is same, but every dish has its own photo. Order anything containing chilies, and you can't go wrong."
"This restaurant is so successful it now has two locations. The one on the road to the airport is the best by far. It is the most established of the better Chinese restaurants in the city, and the Chinese diplomats posted to Laos often dine here. Food selection is multi-regional, but the Sichuan dishes are well done."
"Lackadaisical Cantonese dishes (USD2-9) and a small selection of dim sum (USD1 per plate). There have been reports of them padding the bill. Check the bill carefully before paying, which is something you should do everywhere: in a country where they use a calculator to subtract 7 from 10 it comes as no surprise that their counting of beers consumed is not always accurate, although to be fair the mistakes are not always to the disadvantage of the customer."
"An unheralded gem, this restaurant offers fantastic southwestern Chinese cuisine. The chef hails from Qujing 曲靖 in Yunnan Province. The food is best described as Yunnan-Sichuan fusion. Helps if you know Chinese, but the staff can speak Lao as well. Menu contains plenty of photographs, so if all else fails, just point."
"Formerly the 東北美食館 (Manchuria Gourmet), this restaurant opened with new name and management in Jan 2011. The owner/manager claims the chef is from Chengdu, but the heavily Manchurian-influenced food from the kitchen clearly puts the lie to that claim. It is obvious they have changed the menu to Sichuan fare, but kept a Manchurian chef who doesn't know how to properly prepare it."
"A Malaysian-Indian restaurant. Numerous vegetarian options for 6,000-50,000 kip. Friendly staff and excellent service. Dish quality is extremely variable even for several exact-same dishes ordered on the same day. A bit of a pot-luck option."
"A reasonably-priced vegan restaurant. Seems to be Vietnamese-centric with assortment of mock meats and dishes. Staff nice, place clean, they speak some English."
"Delicious Lao traditional vegetarian/vegan food with some Western-style options. Nice change from the mostly Chinese-style offerings of other buffets. High diversity and rotation rates. In the evening, ask for the menu (they have two: one basic with pictures and another, much larger). 20,000 kip buffet at lunch hours. Family-managed, very clean. Some English spoken."
"Buffet plates, excellent spring rolls and noodle soups available."
"Offers a lunch time buffet serving Laotian vegan food."
"Breezy fourth-floor (no elevator) bar/restaurant which overlooks the Mekong, nice view point for sunsets and then watching the night market below. Tourists, locals, expats, working girls, and ladyboys in seeming harmony. Claims the most extensive range of whiskies in Laos and stocks a wide range of liquors. Special daily cocktail for 20,000 kip. Pool and snooker tables on the 2nd floor. At the back of the bar there is a winner stays/loser pays pool competition every night."
"The second of two gay bars in downtown Vientiane, next to Silapa Restaurant and diagonally across from Vat Inpeng. Friendly atmosphere and staff with good dance beats. Mixed drinks average around 30,000 kip, with happy hour from 19:00-21:00. Second floor has a pool table."
"Vietnamese-owned ""super"" club. Place to go for loud techno music."
"A very classy and cosy bar, owned and run by Japanese-speaking Lao owner. Great drinks. Approximately 50,000 kip per cocktail."
"Everything is supposed to close down before midnight, before the start of the unofficial curfew, although clubs generally stay open until 01:00-01:.30. The most notable exception is this extremely popular spot which is open until 04:00 weekends. It's an after-hours club popular with working girls among others."
"One of two gay bars in central Vientiane. Friendly staff, cheap drinks and occasional cabaret shows around 23:00."
"A classy and expensive bar. The sign out front states ""no shorts, no flip-flops allowed""."
"The name means ""thank you very much"". Popular with tourists, expats and Lao hi-so types. OK food, mid-range prices, large selection of Western, Thai and recently introduced classic Lao dishes. Great place to drink beer in the centre of town."
"Happening all nights of the week. Crowd changes from beginning, midweek, to weekend. Bowling alley and karaoke next door, same owner. Diverse crowd and music."
"Movies shown M-W at 20:00. Thursdays are Salsa nights and most Fridays a DJ is spinning. Possibly plays the most eclectic music in Vientiane."
"Once this was one of only a few bars in town, and was packed every evening, especially between 23:00-02:00 after other bars around town are closed. Perhaps quieter now that there is more competition. Has a pool table and shows sports, but the background music often drowns the TV commentary. Drinkers from Bor Pen Nyang often come here when it closes, then move on again to the Don Chan Palace nightclub once Samlo closes."
"Different cover bands play throughout the night. Maybe the only country-western bar in Laos. A sit and listen to live band place, not a dance club."
"Nice drinking hole and sports bar by the river, good spot for viewing sunsets."
"Clean, nice rooms, great value. Nice baths with great water pressure, real shower, clean linens. Rooms can be small, but have fridge and cable TV. Wi-Fi, but signal can be weak in areas."
"Basic and uninspiring but cheap hostel above an Indian restaurant. A little rundown but cleanish and comfortable beds. No air-con, just fan rooms."
"A simple room with fan and shared bath. Friendly staff. Clean, but has ventilation issues in some rooms (especially on the top floor where there is a smoking section). Watch your head on the stairs, watch your step, and sometimes you have to be patient with the staff. Free Wi-Fi, but only between 09:00-23:00."
"Partner to Mixay Guesthouse and just one block away. Nice guesthouse with many generally small rooms, all with a padlockable draw and good wifi with either fan or air-con. Friendly and helpful staff, you can add breakfast for USD2. Cheap food menu, many items for 15,000 kip plus 5,000 kip for rice. 2 rooms on each floor are without windows to the outside."
"The ""Relax and Dream away"" Guesthouse isn't very dreamy, but does have padded ceiling on the stairs (good for tall people) (but be careful going through doorways), and the library has a huge Korean selection, a modest English selection, and some other languages."
"Has lockers to keep your belongings. Close to the centre. Good Internet, but no Wi-Fi throughout. Mainly in the restaurant downstairs. Friendly stuff, shared toilets. Laundry for 9,000 kip/kg. Warning: bedbugs (May 2013)."
"Nice, atmospheric. Family suite upstairs is huge, clean, very comfortable, and an excellent value. Warning: bedbugs (Dec 2014)."
"Clean rooms with air-con and TV. Very helpful staff can let you know where to find more local stuff in addition to normal tourist things."
"Clean dorm rooms, moderately fast 24-hour Wi-Fi, small balcony, fan and air-con, lamp, locker/cabinet, towel, and water refill for 40,000 kip. Two common rooms, one with TV. Discounted travel fares for guests. Friendly staff."
"A nice cafe with couches downstairs, friendly staff. If you insist, they might offer you an improvised dormitory, which is a three-bed room with window, fan, and a closet. Air-con available in some rooms. Free Wi-Fi of questionable quality. Internet stations are 8,000 kip/hour. Reports of bedbugs. NOW CLOSED"
"Very clean, rooms with air-con, fan, en suite bath. Helpful and friendly staff. Free drinking water in room, bicycle hires 10,000 kip. 12 hr free Wi-Fi with captive portal or [http://www.atcyberia.com/wifi.php Cyberia Hotspot Wi-Fi] at 6,000 kip/hour. The original, older Youth Inn is on the other end of the same road near to the river and has slightly cheaper rooms, but of a lower quality. Avoid the 4th floor in cool season."
"Dorm only backpackers with aircon, lockers and free breakfast."
"A good if not quite their self-proclaimed ""fascinating"" mid-range choice."
"Clean, modest and relatively new hotel in a quiet area. It's family-run. Can book bus to Luang Prabang, and train tickets to Bangkok. They are extremely kind and helpful."
"New, very nice. All rooms have Wi-Fi, courtesy of the HBRM Spirit House next door."
"Mid-size boutique hotel with the warmth of Laotian hospitality. Laundry service, free Wi-Fi, airport transfer and it also accepts credit card with secure facilities."
"Has rooms with air-con, TV, and minibar. There have been reports of guests being presented with larger than agreed bills at check-out."
"A new and modern hotel in the centre. Its rooms are designed for comfort with most all of the conveniences nearby. There are specials and promotions when reserving a room through their website."
"Ask for a room with a view of the river. Has rooms and corridors filled with countless statues with fierce faces, which generates a spooky feeling for some. Rooms are equally spooky with creaking floorboards, so check out the room before you check-in. Wi-Fi is free and there are also two free computers in the lobby. Restaurant has well-prepared Szechuan food, about USD3 per dish. The hotel also runs the '''Inter Stone House''' in the same building round the corner. About the same or a slightly higher price range. Western and Thai/Lao food. Their specialty is the sizzling steak on a stone platter. Offers little for vegetarians. Note: the hotel location is not marked on the map, though it is given in the map legend (H6) - it is where the Inter Restaurant is marked (Restaurant 8)."
"An old, French colonial-style house in a small garden set back from the main road next to a temple. A quiet place to relax, yet right in the centre. Breakfast, wi-fi, garden. Prices US $35-45 for double, incl. breakfast (prices shown on website are considerably cheaper than what they actually charge)."
"A majestic old hotel from decades ago, built 1960. It is one of the oldest hotels in Vientiane. Boasted the first elevator in the country. The charm of past glory, see the bathroom fittings. Hunter S. Thompson wrote dispatches from here after scrambling out of Saigon as it fell. They claim that English, French, Japanese, Thai, Russian, Vietnamese and Lao are spoken. The restaurant has traditional Lao music and dance performances every evening from about 19:00, which you watch while eating your dinner of (recommended) Lao food. Get there early to secure a table with a good view of the stage"
"Decent hotel in a slightly out of the way location. Free Wi-Fi in rooms plus computers for guest use in lobby. Small but pleasant garden that is mostly occupied by a clean swimming pool. Quiet environment, also not much noise between rooms. On-site restaurant is reasonable but by no means the best. Breakfast options are limited but make reasonable start to the day. Friendly staff. Air-ticket and tour booking service. Most expensive rooms have large balconies overlooking swimming pool. Good business hotel or for tourists who don't mind being a little out of the way."
"Great central location near the fountain. Clean rooms with air-con and private bath. A simple breakfast is included and is different every day, served in a nice garden setting. Wi-Fi. Their laundry service is good for neither your clothes nor your budget."
"Mixok Guest House and Mixok Inn are next to each other in city centre. All rooms are equipped with cable TV, private bath with hot shower, free Wi-Fi in the room and free breakfast. Can also help you to book transfer to airport or bus station, as well as bus and train tickets."
"Renovated, very clean hotel with quiet spacious rooms. Rate includes cable TV, free bottled water, free Internet cafe, and Wi-Fi, breakfast (eggs, toast and coffee). French-run French restaurant on the premises. You can book a bus to Nong Kai, Udon Thani, Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang at the desk. Airport pick up available upon request. Receptionists speak English, and all staff are kind and helpful."
"Large rooms that face the river, with en suite baths and air-con are USD20. Friendly staff and nice location on the river."
"Clean with air-con, private bath, free Wi-Fi."
"Clean guesthouse. Free Wi-Fi, TV, air-con, warm water. Possibility of breakfast, but not included as standard. Nice large rooms with en-suite bath."
"Very clean, rooms with wooden floors, air-con, hot water. Helpful and friendly staff. Free Wi-Fi, but only reaches first floor rooms and lobby."
"Comfortable two building hotel in a quiet area. The garden with nice seating area and hammocks make for a relaxing stay. Rooms are traditional Lao-style and unique, although a bit dark. Rooms have fan and air-con. Breakfast not included. Wi-Fi costs USD1.50 a day. Overall a wonderful place for a good price."
"Owned and operated by the Chanthapanya family, the hotel offers the charm of a family guest house while providing the comfort of a hotel. All rooms have air-con, Wi-Fi, personal safe, cable TV, 24 hr hot water. Wi-Fi access points are on floors 2 and 4, and reception is best there. Has swimming pool and small gym. Beware unpleasant smells from air-con in some top floor rooms, and ask for a room with a view rather than a view of the neighbour's wall. They lock up early, check with reception."
"This hotel was completed in 2004, ''almost'' complying with the municipality's by-laws which at the time limited buildings in Vientiane to 7 storeys (Don Chan has 14). The place to be if you are looking for panoramic views, although this comes at a cost--this monstrosity has singlehandedly ruined the Vientiane skyline. It has a swimming pool overlooking the Mekong and a popular open-air beer garden overlooking the Mekong which gets crowded late in the evening. Rooms are showing their age, and often smell of stale cigarettes. Slightly far from the centre, but hotel provides shuttle service to city centre. Careful when shopping for jewellery in the shops in the lobby."
"A newer hotel built in Lao style, several buildings in a garden setting. Nice pool. It is somewhat away from the centre, but ideal to get away from the bustle. Recent guest complaints about lost or stolen items have been verified by local authorities. Be careful with your belongings at this hotel. Shuttle bus to the city centre every hour until 22:00."
"The former Novotel in new premises. Friendly staff with surprisingly good English, a peaceful courtyard with spotless pool, fitness centre, and steam bath. Family friendly. Sunday brunch (11:00-15:00) at 130,000 kip including use of pool and fitness centre. Saturday and Sunday poolside BBQ (15:00-18:00). Despite the prices, Wi-Fi costs extra (starting from 20,000 kip per hour)."
"Named by ''Frommer's Budget Travel Magazine'' as one of the best boutique hotels in the world. Salana is the old Xaysana Hotel revamped. With 41 rooms, Salana has an excellent location in the centre of the city near the river and Chao Anou Park. The hotel is well-known to business travellers and tourists, and has received many positive reviews. Has a restaurant/cafe offering a good selection of Western dishes. Known for employing Lao chefs from famous hotels in Laos, is in a very good location. Good selection of beers & beverages available."
"Built circa 1932, the luxurious hotel has been restored to its former charm. Re-opened in 1999, the French colonial architecture, its period furniture, and its landscaped gardens with a free-form pool, complemented by modern facilities, are some of the features of this historical landmark in the heart of Vientiane. If you see a London taxicab cruising the streets, it is theirs. It's used to ferry guests around. Has an excellent restaurant, ""La Belle Epoque"", and an open-air pavement café."
"Lives up to its name fairly well. No firewalls or program-install restrictions."
"Most popular gym among the expat community. Expressionless reception staff and many under-employed young male staff standing around staring at you, but excellent equipment and a nice pool. Be especially watchful at the pool with children or the infirm."
"For the more adventurous/frugal gym-goer."

"Visit Manitoba’s beloved '''Golden Boy''', who is perched atop the Provincial Legislative building. The Golden Boy, a magnificently gilded 5.25 m (17.2 ft) figure sculpted by Charles Gardet of Paris and cast in 1918 at the Barbidienne foundry in France, is probably Manitoba's best known symbol. Embodying the spirit of enterprise and eternal youth, he is poised atop the dome of the building. He faces the north, with its mineral resources, fish, forest, furs, hydroelectric power and seaport, where his province's future lies. The foundry was partially destroyed by bombs during the First World War, but the Golden Boy emerged unharmed. Go inside the building to see the exquisite grand staircase and rotunda. Guided tours available."

"Hockey (National Hockey League): In 2011, Winnipeg once again became home to an NHL team after a Winnipeg-based group purchased the Atlanta Thrashers. The team resurrected the Jets name that had been used by two other Winnipeg-based hockey teams, most notably the city's former NHL franchise. The Jets play at the MTS Centre, built in 2004 and a first-class venue for hockey games and concerts, though small by NHL standards. Season-ticket packages sold out less than a week after being placed on sale. Single-game tickets are technically available, but are very hard to come by; 13,000 of the arena's 15,000 seats were dedicated to season tickets."
"Hockey (American Hockey League). The Manitoba Moose are the professional farm team of the Winnipeg Jets, and play at least 38 regular season games at the MTS Centre. The AHL is professional and developmental league where NHL draft picks, prospects, and ex-NHL veterans regularly play. Compared to the NHL, AHL hockey is more affordable and tickets are more readily available. AHL games are generally more family friendly as a result. The level of hockey is generally lower than the NHL, but many AHL players end up moving up to the NHL league eventually. The Manitoba Moose play at the same arena as the Winnipeg Jets."

"With a surface area of 132 square miles, Yellowstone Lake is the largest lake at high elevation (more than 7,000 ft.) in North America. It is a natural lake, situated at 7,733 ft. above sea level. It is roughly 20 miles long and 14 miles wide with 141 miles of shoreline. It is frozen nearly half the year. It freezes in late December or early January and thaws in late May or early June."
"The Hayden Valley is located six miles north of Fishing Bridge Junction. The Pelican Valley is situated three miles east of Fishing Bridge. These two vast valleys comprise some of the best habitat in the lower 48 states for grizzly bears, bison, elk, and other wildlife species."
"This rock formation is accessible via an easy one-mile walk, and there is also a bicycle trail leading to the bridge. The Natural Bridge was formed by erosion of a rhyolite outcrop by Bridge Creek. The top of the bridge is approximately 51 ft. above the creek. A short switchback trail leads to the top, though travel across the bridge is now prohibited to protect this feature."
"The LeHardy Rapids are a cascade on the Yellowstone River. Geomorphologically, it is thought that this is the actual spot where the lake ends and the river continues its northward flow. In the spring, many cutthroat trout may be seen here, resting in the shallow pools before expending bursts of energy to leap up the rapids on the their way to spawn under Fishing Bridge. A boardwalk, built in 1984, provides access to the area, although it is closed during the spring nesting season to protect this sensitive bird habitat."
"This was once a hilltop thermal feature that would hurl mud into the nearby trees during eruptions, but a particularly large eruption blew apart the Mud Volcano, leaving a hot, bubbling mud pool at the base of the hill. Access to the area is via a short loop from the parking lot past the Dragon's Mouth and the Mud Volcano that is handicapped accessible, and a half-mile upper loop trail via Sour Lake and the Black Dragon's Caldron that is relatively steep. The rhythmic belching of steam and the flashing tongue of water give the Dragon's Mouth Spring its name, though its activity has decreased notably since December 1994. The Black Dragon's Caldron exploded onto the landscape in 1948, blowing trees out by their roots and covering the surrounding forest with mud. In January 1995, a new feature on the south bank of Mud Geyser became extremely active, covering an area of 20 by 8 feet and comprised of fumaroles, small pools, and frying-pan type features. The most dramatic features of the Mud Volcano area, including the huge seething mud pot known as the ""Gumper"", are open to the public only via off-boardwalk ranger-guided walks."
"The Sulphur Caldron area can be viewed from a staging area just north of Mud Volcano. The yellow, turbulent splashing waters of the Sulphur Caldron are among the most acidic in the park with a pH of 1.3. Other features which can be viewed from this overlook are Turbulent Pool (which is no longer ""turbulent"") and the crater of a large, active mud pot."
"The original bridge was built in 1902 as a rough-hewn corduroy log bridge with a slightly different alignment than the current bridge. The existing bridge was built in 1937. The Fishing Bridge was historically a tremendously popular place to fish. Angling from the bridge was quite good, due to the fact that it was a major spawning area for cutthroat trout. However, because of the decline of the cutthroat population (in part, a result of this practice), the bridge was closed to fishing in 1973. Since that time, it has become a popular place to observe fish."
"The Fishing Bridge Museum was completed in 1931 and would eventually become a prototype of rustic architecture in parks all over the nation. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. When automobiles replaced stagecoaches as the main means of transportation through the park, people were no longer accompanied by a guide, so the museum was built as a ""Trailside Museum,"" allowing visitors to obtain information about Yellowstone on their own."
"The Lake Yellowstone Hotel opened in 1891 on a site long known as a meeting place for Indians, trappers, and mountain men. At that time, it was not particularly distinctive, resembling any other railroad hotel financed by the Northern Pacific Railroad. It was renovated in 1903, with additional changes made in 1929. By the 1970s, the Hotel had fallen into serious disrepair. In 1981, the National Park Service and the park concessionaire, TW Recreational Services, embarked upon a ten-year project to restore the Lake Hotel in appearance to its days of glory in the 1920s. The work was finished for the celebration of the hotel's centennial in 1991. The Hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places that year."
"After a decade of military administration in Yellowstone, Congress created the National Park Service in 1916. Ranger stations began to replace soldier stations throughout the park. The Lake Ranger Station was completed in 1923. The first Director of the National Park Service, Steven Mather, suggested that the station should blend in with its natural and cultural environment. A local woodsman used pioneer building techniques to give the station its ""trapper cabin"" style. With park architects, Superintendent Horace Albright designed a large octagonal ""community room"" with a central stone fireplace. This rustic hall served an informational function by day, and, in the evening, it became the scene of a folksy gathering around a log fire."
"The advent of the auto in the park in 1915 created a great influx of visitors. The need arose for an intermediate style of lodging between the luxury of the Lake Hotel and the rustic accommodations of the tent camps. In 1926, the Lake Lodge (also a Robert Reamer design) was completed, one of four lodges in the park. The park was no longer primarily accessible to only affluent ""dudes"" or hearty ""sagebrushers."""
"Like Lake Village and Fishing Village, this area provides access to North America's largest high elevation lake.  The topmost layers of the lake rarely exceeds 66°F, and the lower layers are much colder; because of the extremely cold water, swimming is not recommended."
"This geyser basin is situated along the shore for a distance of two miles, extending back from it about five hundred yards and into the lake perhaps as many feet. There are several hundred springs here, varying in size from miniature fountains to pools or wells seventy-five feet in diameter and of great depth. Additionally, a small cluster of mud springs.  Of particular note, the Abyss Pool offers an optical illusion that makes it look bottomless, and Fishing Cone is a offshore pool which was once popular as a spot to cook newly-caught fish by dipping them into this partially submerged hot spring. (This stunt is no longer allowed.)"
"Lying in the Snake River watershed west of Lewis Lake and south of Yellowstone Lake, Heart Lake was named sometime before 1871 for Hart Hunney, an early hunter."
"This lake is on the Continental Divide at Craig Pass in 1891. Isa Lake is noteworthy as probably the only lake on earth that drains naturally to two oceans backwards, the east side draining to the Pacific and the west side to the Atlantic."
"This small range of mountains, located just west of Heart Lake, is completely contained within the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park. The name of the range comes from the color of the volcanic rocks which compose them. There are 12 peaks in the range, with 10,308-foot-high Mount Sheridan being the highest."
"This lake is the park's second largest lake and is located at the head of the Lewis River southwest of West Thumb.  Shoshone Lake is 205 feet at its maximum depth and has an area of 8,050 acres.  Originally, Shoshone Lake was barren of fish owing to waterfalls on the Lewis River, but today the lake contains introduced lake trout, brown trout, and Utah chubs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes that Shoshone Lake may be the largest lake in the lower 48 states that cannot be reached by road. No motorboats are allowed on the lake."
"Built in 1925, with the open breezeway enclosed in 1966, the West Thumb Ranger Station is an excellent example of historic architecture associated with ranger stations in Yellowstone."
"Yellowstone, as a whole, possesses close to sixty percent of the world's geysers, and the Upper Geyser Basin is home to the largest numbers of this fragile feature found in the park, including the iconic ""Old Faithful"" geyser. Old Faithful, the world's most famous geyser, has large eruptions occurring an average of about once every eighty minutes, although the timing between each eruption varies by as much as an hour and has been increasing over the years. Rangers are able to predict the geyser's eruptions to within about ten minutes, provided the duration of the previous eruption is known. In addition to Old Faithful, this basin contains an additional 150 geysers within a one square mile area; of this remarkable number, the eruptions of Castle, Grand, Daisy, Riverside, and Old Faithful are predicted regularly by the naturalist staff. In addition to geysers the area is home to numerous hot springs. Boardwalks allow access to the most interesting areas. ''Do not leave the trails''; the surface here is thin and unstable and has a real chance of depositing you in a boiling pool of water if you walk where you're not supposed to."
"This large area of hydrothermal activity can be viewed by foot along the boardwalk trail at Fountain Paint Pots and by car along the three mile Firehole Lake Drive. The latter is a one-way drive where you will find the sixth geyser predicted by the Old Faithful staff: Great Fountain. Its splashy eruptions send jets of diamond droplets bursting 100-200 feet in the air, while waves of water cascade down the raised terraces. Patience is a virtue with this twice-a-day geyser, as the predictions allow a 2 hour (plus or minus) window of opportunity. Fountain Flats Drive departs the Grand Loop Road just south of the Nez Perce picnic area and follows along the Firehole River to a trail head 1.5 miles distant. From there, the Fountain Freight Road hiking/biking trail continues along the old roadbed giving hikers access to the Sentinel Meadows Trail and the Fairy Falls Trail. Also along this path is the only handicapped-accessible backcountry site in the Old Faithful district at Goose Lake."
"This geyser basin is located on a hill overlooking the Firehole River. Smaller in size than they other geyser basins in the area, the runoff from its thermal features flows into the river, leaving steaming, colorful trails in its wake. In particular, Excelsior Geyser reveals a gaping crater 200 x 300 feet with a constant discharge of more than 4,000 gallons of water per minute into the Firehole River; this geyser once erupted so violently that it may in fact have blown itself up, and no eruptions have since occurred. Also in this surprising basin is Yellowstone's largest hot spring, the beautifully-colored Grand Prismatic Spring. This feature is 370 feet in diameter and more than 121 feet in depth. There is a trail that goes around the back of the spring which has a small turn-off that lets intrepid climbers rise about 400 feet above the spring, and capture the entire basin in one view."
"This backcountry geyser basin is easily reached by a 5-mile round-trip hike that follows an old, now-closed road from the trail-head south of Old Faithful. Lone Star Geyser erupts about every three hours. There is a logbook, located in a cache near the geyser, for observations of geyser times and types of eruptions. Bicycles can make it most of the way to Lone Star."
"Shoshone Geyser Basin is reached by a 17-mile round-trip hike that crosses the Continental Divide at Grant's Pass. This basin has no boardwalks, and extreme caution should be exercised when traveling through it. Trails in the basin must be used. Remote thermal areas, such as this, should be approached with respect, knowledge, and care. Be sure to emphasize personal safety and resource protection when entering a backcountry basin."
"The river derives its name from the steam (which they thought was smoke from fires) witnessed by early trappers to the area. Their term for a mountain valley was ""hole,"" and the designation was born. The Firehole River boasts a world-famous reputation for challenging fly-fishing. Brown, rainbow, and brook trout give the angler a wary target in this stream."
"This is the most easily reached waterfall in the district. A marked pullout just south of Old Faithful and a short walk from the car offers the visitor easy access to view this 125-foot cascade."
"Built during the winter of 1903-04, the Old Faithful Inn is one of the few remaining log hotels in the United States. It is a masterpiece of rustic architecture in its stylized design and fine craftsmanship. Its influence on American architecture, particularly park architecture, was immeasurable. The building is a rustic log and wood-frame structure with gigantic proportions: nearly 700 feet in length and seven stories high. The lobby of the hotel features a 65-foot ceiling, a massive rhyolite fireplace, and railings made of contorted lodgepole pine. Visitor can stand in the middle of the lobby and look up at the exposed structure, or climb up a gnarled log staircase to one of the balconies and look up, down, or across. Wings were added to the hotel in 1915 and 1927, and today there are 327 rooms available to guests in this National Historic Landmark."
"Built in 1897, this is the oldest structure in the Old Faithful area still in use. The ""knotty pine"" porch is a popular resting place for visitors, providing a great view of Geyser Hill. (The oldest building at Old Faithful was built as a photo studio in 1897 for F. Jay Haynes. Originally located 700 feet southwest of Beehive Geyser and about 350 feet northwest of the front of the Old Faithful Inn, it now stands near the intersection of the Grand Loop Road and the fire lane, near the crosswalk.)"
"Artists Paintpots is a small but lovely thermal area just south of Norris Junction. A one-mile round trip trail takes visitors to colorful hot springs, two large mud pots, and through a section of forest burned in 1988. Adjacent to this area are three other off-trail, backcountry thermal areas: Sylvan Springs, Gibbon Hill Geyser Basin, and Geyser Creek Thermal area. These areas are fragile, dangerous, and difficult to get to; travel without knowledgeable personnel is discouraged."
"This 84-foot (26-meter) waterfall tumbles over remnants of the Yellowstone Caldera rim and is easily accessible from a pullover on the park road. The rock wall on the opposite side of the road from the waterfall is the inner rim of the caldera."
"This small, nearly dormant basin lies at the top of a very steep one-mile trail. Highlights of the area include thermos-bottle shaped geyser cones that are remnants of a much more active time, several intriguing travertine structures, and some great views."
"The Madison River is formed at the junction of the Gibbon and Firehole rivers, hence Madison Junction. The Madison joins the Jefferson and the Gallatin rivers at Three Forks, Montana, to form the Missouri River. The Madison is a blue-ribbon fly fishing stream with healthy stocks of brown and rainbow trout and mountain whitefish. The canyon created by the river consists of steep, tree-covered rock walls on each side."
"The small thermal area just north of Madison Junction. This area provides the visitor with a short boardwalk tour of hot springs."
"Firehole Canyon Drive, a side road, follows the Firehole River upstream from Madison Junction to just above Firehole Falls. The drive takes sightseers past 800-foot thick lava flows. Firehole Falls is a 40-foot waterfall. An un-staffed swimming area here is very popular in the warmest of the summer season. Cliff diving is illegal."
"The mountain is actually part of the lava flows that encircle the Madison Junction area. Near this site, in 1870, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition is said to have camped and discussed the future of the region they were exploring. Legend has it that this was where the idea of the national park was discussed. It should be noted that there is no evidence of the campfire conversation ever taking place, and there is certainly no evidence to show that the idea of a national park was discussed."
"Norris Geyser Basin is the hottest, oldest, and most dynamic of Yellowstone's thermal areas. The highest temperature yet recorded in any geothermal area in Yellowstone was measured in a scientific drill hole at Norris: 459°F (237°C) just 1,087 feet (326 meters) below the surface, and there are very few thermal features at Norris under the boiling point (199°F at this elevation). Norris shows evidence of having had thermal features for at least 115,000 years. The features in the basin change daily, with frequent disturbances from seismic activity and water fluctuations. Steamboat Geyser, the tallest geyser in the world (300 to 400 feet) and Echinus Geyser (pH 3.5 or so) are the most popular features. The basin consists of three areas: Porcelain Basin, Back Basin, and One Hundred Springs Plain. Porcelain Basin is barren of trees and provides a sensory experience in sound, color, and smell; a 3/4 mile dirt and boardwalk trail accesses this area. Back Basin is more heavily wooded with features scattered throughout the area; a 1.5 mile trail of boardwalk and dirt encircles this part of the basin. One Hundred Springs Plain is an off-trail section of the Norris Geyser Basin that is very acidic, hollow, and dangerous. Travel is discouraged without the guidance of knowledgeable staff members."
"Located next to the park road just north of Norris on the Norris-Mammoth section of the Grand Loop Road, Roaring Mountain is a large, acidic thermal area (solfatara) that contains many steam vents (fumaroles) which make noises ranging from a nearly inaudible whisper to a roar that can be heard miles away. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the number, size, and power of the fumaroles was much greater than today."
"The Gibbon River flows from Wolf Lake through the Norris area and meets the Firehole River at Madison Junction to form the Madison River. Both cold and hot springs are responsible for the majority of the Gibbon's flow. Brook trout, brown trout, grayling, and rainbow trout find the Gibbon to their liking. The Gibbon River is fly-fishing only below Gibbon Falls."
"A three-mile section of the old road takes visitors past 60-foot high Virginia Cascades. This cascading waterfall is formed by the very small (at that point) Gibbon River."
"This is a 22-mile swath of lodgepole pine blown down by wind-shear action in 1984. It was then burned during the North Fork fire in 1988. This is the site where a famous news anchor said, ""Tonight, this is all that's left of Yellowstone."" A wayside exhibit there tells the story."
"The Norris Soldier Station (Museum of the National Park Ranger) was an outlying station for soldiers to patrol and watch over Norris Geyser Basin. It was among the longest occupied stations in the park. A prior structure was built in 1886, replaced after fire in 1897, and modified in 1908. After the Army years, the building was used as a Ranger Station and residence until the 1959 earthquake caused structural damage. The building was restored in 1991."
"The Norris Geyser Basin Museum is one of the park's original trailside museums built in 1929-30. It has always been a museum. It is an outstanding example of a stone-and-log architecture."
"These mammoth rock formations are the main attraction of the Mammoth District and are accessible via boardwalk. These features are quite different from thermal areas elsewhere in the park as travertine formations grow much more rapidly than sinter formations due to the softer nature of limestone. As hot water rises through limestone, large quantities of rock are dissolved by the hot water, and a white chalky mineral is deposited on the surface. Formations here change rapidly, and while a favorite spring may appear to have ""died,"" it is important to realize that the location of springs and the rate of flow changes daily, that ""on-again-off-again"" is the rule, and that the overall volume of water discharged by all of the springs fluctuates little."
"The North Entrance Road from Gardiner, Montana, to Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, runs along the Gardner River. The road winds into the park, up the canyon, past crumbling walls of sandstone and ancient mudflows. The vegetation is much thicker in the canyon than on the open prairie down below, the common trees being Rocky Mountain juniper, cottonwood, and Douglas-fir. Low-growing willows also crowd the river's edge in the flatter, flood-prone sections of the canyon. Watch for wildlife in season: eagles, osprey, dippers, and kingfishers along the river and bighorn sheep in the steeper parts of the canyon."
"A sign north of where the road crosses the Gardner River marks the 45th parallel of latitude. A little distance south of the sign, a parking area on the east side of the road is used by bathers in the ""Boiling River"", one of a very few spots in the park where visitors can soak in naturally-heated water. Bathers must walk upstream about a half mile from the parking area to the place where the footpath reaches the river. This spot is also marked by large clouds of steam, especially in cold weather. Here, the hot water runoff from the Mammoth Terraces, enters the Gardner River. The hot and the cold water mix in pools along the river's edge. Bathers are allowed in the river during daylight hours only. Bathing suits are required, and no alcoholic beverages are allowed. Boiling River is closed in the springtime due to hazardous high water and often does not reopen until mid-summer. It tends to be very crowded, so try to visit very early in the morning during peak season."
"Mt. Everts was named for explorer Truman Everts of the 1870 Washburn Expedition who became separated from his camping buddies, lost his glasses, lost his horse, and spent the next 37 days starving and freezing and hallucinating as he made his way through the un-tracked and inhospitable wilderness. Upon rescue, he was, according to his rescuers, within but a few hours of death. Everts never made it quite as far as Mt. Everts. He was found near the ""Cut"" on the Blacktail Plateau Drive and was mistaken for a black bear and nearly shot. His story, which he later published in Scribner's Monthly Magazine, remains one of Yellowstone's best known, lost-in-the-wilderness stories. It has also been published in book form, edited by Yellowstone's archivist Lee Whittlesey under the name Lost in the Yellowstone. Mt. Everts is made up of distinctly layered sandstones and shales--sedimentary rocks deposited when this area was covered by a shallow inland sea, 70 to 140 million years ago."
"Bunsen Peak and the ""Bunsen burner"" were both named for the German physicist, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. He was involved in pioneering research about geysers, and a ""Bunsen burner"" has a resemblance to a geyser. His theory on geysers was published in the 1800s, and it is still believed to be accurate. Bunsen Peak is 8,564 feet high (2,612 meters) and may be climbed via a trail that starts at the Golden Gate. Another trail, the old Bunsen Peak road, skirts around the flank of the peak from the YCC camp to the Golden Gate. This old road may be used by hikers, mountain-bikers, and skiers in winter. The peak overlooks the old Ft. Yellowstone area and it is only a gradual climb. Bring water and snacks (and bear bells if you think they'll work)."
"All of the red-roofed, many-chimneyed buildings in the Mammoth area are part of historic Fort Yellowstone. Beginning in 1886, after 14 years of poor civilian management of the park, the Cavalry was called upon to manage the park's resources and visitors. Because the Cavalry only expected to be here a short while, they built a temporary post near the base of the Terraces called Camp Sheridan. After five cold, harsh winters, they realized that their stay in the park was going to be longer than expected, so they built Fort Yellowstone, a permanent post. In 1891, the first building to be constructed was the guard house because it directly coincided with the Cavalry's mission - protection and management. By 1916, the National Park Service was established, and the Cavalry gave control of Yellowstone back to the civilians. Since that time, historic Fort Yellowstone has been Yellowstone's headquarters."
"The first major entrance for Yellowstone was at the north boundary. Robert Reamer, a famous architect in Yellowstone, designed the immense stone arch for coaches to travel through on their way into the park. At the time of the arch's construction, President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting the park. He consequently placed the cornerstone for the arch, which then took his name. The top of the Roosevelt Arch is inscribed with ""For the benefit and enjoyment of the people,"" which is from the Organic Act of 1916."
"Dating to the 1880s, this cemetery contains graves of early settlers and employees."
"The Petrified Tree, located near the Lost Lake trail head, is an excellent example of an ancient redwood, similar to many found on Specimen Ridge, that is easily accessible to park visitors."
"Located along the Northeast Entrance Road east of Tower Junction, this area contains the largest concentration of petrified trees in the world. There are also excellent samples of petrified leaf impressions, conifer needles, and microscopic pollen from numerous species no longer growing in the park."
"This 132' tall waterfall is easily accessible from the main park road and is framed by eroded volcanic pinnacles."
"This grouping of thermal springs along the Yellowstone River signals the downstream end of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The steep, columnar basalt cliffs on the opposite side of the river from the overlook are remnants of an ancient lava flow, providing a window into the past volcanic forces that shaped much of the Yellowstone landscape. The gorge and cliffs provide habitat for numerous wildlife species including bighorn sheep, red-tailed hawks, and osprey."
"The Lamar Buffalo Ranch was built in the early part of the century in an effort to increase the herd size of the few remaining bison in Yellowstone, preventing the feared extinction of the species. Buffalo ranching operations continued at Lamar until the 1950s. The valley was irrigated for hay pastures, and corrals and fencing were scattered throughout the area. Four remaining buildings from the original ranch compound are contained within the Lamar Buffalo Ranch Historic District (two residences, the bunkhouse, and the barn) and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Visitors can drive by to view the historic buffalo ranch, however, there are no facilities open to the general public at this location."
"The Tower Ranger Station, though not on the National Register of Historic Places, is a remodeled reconstruction of the second Tower Soldier Station, which was built in 1907. The Roosevelt Lodge was constructed in 1920 and has been determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The Roosevelt National Historic District also includes the Roosevelt cabins."
"The Northeast Entrance Ranger Station was constructed in 1934-35 and is a National Historic Landmark. Its rustic log construction is characteristic of ""parkitecture"" common in the national parks of the west during that period."
"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is the primary geologic feature in the Canyon District. It is roughly 20 miles long, measured from the Upper Falls to the Tower Fall area. Depth is 800 to 1,200 ft.; width is 1,500 to 4,000 ft. The present canyon is no more than 10,000 to 14,000 years old, although there has probably been a canyon in this location for a much longer period. Chemical processes over time have left stripes and patches of different colors in the rock of this canyon. Trails lead along the north and south rims of the canyon, but while traveling the entire trail in one day is possible, it makes for a long and tiring day. Best to make it two shorter (~3 hour) day hikes. If you're a photo buff, plan your walks so the sun illuminates the opposite side for great pictures."
"The Upper Falls is 109 ft. high and can be seen from the Brink of the Upper Falls Trail and from Uncle Tom's Trail. The Lower Falls is 308 ft. high and can be seen from Lookout Point, Red Rock Point, Artist Point, Brink of the Lower Falls Trail, and from various points on the South Rim Trail. The Lower Falls is often described as being more than twice the size of Niagara, although this only refers to its height and not the volume of water flowing over it. A third falls can be found in the canyon between the Upper and Lower falls. Crystal Falls is the outfall of Cascade Creek into the canyon. It can be seen from the South Rim Trail just east of the Uncle Tom's area."
"Hayden Valley is one of the best places in the park to view a wide variety of wildlife. It is an excellent place to look for grizzly bears, particularly in the spring and early summer when they may be preying upon newborn bison and elk calves. Large herds of bison may be viewed in the spring, early summer, and during the fall rut, which usually begins late July to early August. Coyotes can almost always be seen in the valley. Bird life is abundant in and along the river. A variety of shore birds may be seen in the mud flats at Alum Creek. A pair of sandhill cranes usually nests at the south end of the valley. Ducks, geese, and American white pelicans cruise the river. The valley is also an excellent place to look for bald eagles and northern harriers."
"Mt. Washburn is the main peak in the Washburn Range, rising 10,243 ft. above the west side of the canyon. It is the remnant of volcanic activity that took place long before the formation of the present canyon. Mt. Washburn was named for Gen. Henry Dana Washburn, leader of the 1870 Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition. One of the best places in the park for spotting bighorn sheep and also a great spot for wildflowers, a trail leads up the mountain to a lookout tower near the 10,243 foot summit. The altitude may affect some hikers, so it is best to be acclimatized to the higher elevation before attempting this hike. In addition, bring extra layers, even in the summer, since the top can be windy and cold."
"The Canyon Village complex is part of the Mission 66 project in the park. The Visitor Center was completed in 1957, and the new lodge was open for business in the same year. Though some people consider the development representative of the architecture of the time, none of the present buildings in the complex can be considered historic. There are, however, still remnants of the old hotel, lodge, and related facilities."
"Yellowstone opens its roads to bicyclists and hikers one week before car traffic resumes each spring (usually in April).  This week is a rare opportunity to see Yellowstone's sights and wildlife without the crowds and traffic.  Several West Yellowstone businesses rent bikes."
"Ranger-led programs are offered year-round and provide an opportunity to visit a portion of the park in a small-group setting with a ranger who will provide information about the sights along the way.  Most ranger programs involve a short hike."
"Jr Ranger Program provides an opportunity for children 5 - 12 to earn a Jr Ranger patch.  Ages 5-7 can earn the wolf patch and Ages 8-12 can earn the Bear patch. In order to get a patch, a 12 page activity booklet needs to be answered correctly and checked by a ranger. An activity booklet costs $3."
"Students ages 5 and up can learn about Yellowstone's geothermal features.  Students are given scientist toolkit, including an infrared thermometer, stop watch, magnifying glass and other gear.  Once you've finished it, you have a choice of a patch or key chain."
"There is a great variety of wildlife to view within the park limits. Birds (osprey, bald eagles, and many, many other species,) bison, big cats, deer, wolves, fox, bears, big-horn sheep, elk, and other animals can all be seen within the park in a short time. The more time that you spend in the park, the more wildlife you will see. Some animals, such as wolves, bears, and big-horn sheep, are generally not viewable from the park roads. Habitat preferences and seasonal cycles of movement determine, in a general sense, where a particular animal may be at a particular time. Early morning and evening hours are when animals tend to be feeding and thus are more easily seen. Wild animals, especially females with young, are unpredictable and dangerous. Keep a safe distance from all wildlife. Each year a number of park visitors are injured by wildlife when approaching too closely. '''Approaching on foot within 100 yards (91 m) of bears or wolves or within 25 yards (23 m) of other wildlife is prohibited.''' Please use roadside pullouts when viewing wildlife. The spaces within the park are grand, so make sure to bring binoculars and/or a spotting scope to view animals safely and to avoid disturbing them. By being sensitive to its needs, you will see more of an animal's natural behavior and activity. If you cause an animal to move, you are too close! It is illegal to willfully remain near or approach wildlife, including birds, within ANY distance that disturbs or displaces the animal."
"Xanterra Parks & Resorts offers horse rides of one and two hours in length which are available at Mammoth, Tower-Roosevelt, and Canyon. Advance reservations are recommended. In addition, they also offer horseback or wagon rides which take visitors to a cookout site for a steak dinner. Advance reservations are required; call +1 307 344-7311 or +1-866-439-7375. TDD service (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) is available at 307-344-5395. Online reservations are not available at this time. Guided stock trips into the backcountry (horse or llama) may be arranged with one of the stock outfitters licensed to operate in Yellowstone. Private stock can be brought into the park. Overnight stock use is not permitted prior to July 1, due to range readiness and/or wet trail conditions. Horses are not allowed in frontcountry campgrounds, but are permitted in certain backcountry campsites."
"Yellowstone has a designated backcountry campsite system, and a Backcountry Use Permit is required for all overnight stays. Each designated campsite has a maximum limit for the number of people and stock allowed per night. The maximum stay per campsite varies from 1 to 3 nights per trip. Campfires are permitted only in established fire pits. Wood fires are not allowed in some backcountry campsites. A food storage pole is provided at most designated campsites so that food and attractants may be secured from bears. See the Backcountry section below for additional details."
"Yellowstone holds unprecedented photo opportunities with natural environments, beautiful hydrothermal features, and animals to be found throughout the park. The colors of the hot springs range from bland white (for the very, very hot) to yellows and blues, greens and oranges. Some of the features are very large, and the challenge can be finding a way to get them in the frame. Be creative! There have been a lot of pictures taken in Yellowstone, and there are a lot more still waiting to be taken."
"Permits are required for fishing, and not all areas are open to fishing; check with rangers. Native species include arctic grayling, Westslope cutthroat trout and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Non-native species include brook trout, brown trout, lake trout and rainbow trout.  Check the [http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm park's fishing guidelines] for the latest rules and regulations."
"Swimming is allowed (but not encouraged) at the Firehole Cascades swimming area, a section of the Firehole River that is warmed by hot springs. This area, accessible via the Firehole Canyon Drive, has a toilet but no lifeguard and not much parking. Swimming is also possible in the Boiling River near Mammoth. Swimming in Yellowstone Lake is permitted but not recommended due to temperatures which seldom exceed 66&deg;F."
"A permit is required for all vessels (motorized and non-motorized including float tubes) and must be obtained in person at any of the following locations: South Entrance, Lewis Lake Campground, Grant Village Backcountry Office, and Bridge Bay Ranger Station. Non-motorized boating permits are available at West Entrance, Northeast Entrance, Mammoth Backcountry Office, Old Faithful Backcountry Office, Canyon Backcountry Office, Bechler Ranger Station, West Contact Station, West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce and locations where motorized permits are sold. The fee is $20 (annual) or $10 (7 day) for motorized vessels and $10 (annual) or $5 (7 day) for non-motorized vessels. A Coast Guard approved wearable personal flotation device is required for each person boating. Boat permits issued in Grand Teton National Park are honored in Yellowstone, but owners must register their vessel in Yellowstone and obtain a no-charge Yellowstone validation sticker from a permit issuing station. Jet skis, personal watercraft, airboats, submersibles, and similar vessels are prohibited in Yellowstone National Park. All vessels are prohibited on park rivers and streams except the channel between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, where only hand-propelled vessels are permitted. Outboards and rowboats may be rented (first come, first served) from Xanterra Parks & Resorts at Bridge Bay Marina on Yellowstone Lake. Xanterra also provides guided fishing boats which may be reserved in advance by calling +1 307 344-7311 or +1-866-GEYSERLAND (439-7375)."
"most trails in the park are closed to mountain bikes, however several gravel roads are open to BOTH bicycle and automotive traffic. The Old Gardiner Road and Blacktail Plateau Drive allow two-way bike traffic and one-way auto traffic. These roads are best suited for mountain bikes and usually closed to autos and offer anther way to experience the park."
"This easy trail leads to a natural bridge that is a 51 foot (18 m) cliff of rhyolite rock cut through by Bridge Creek. The hiking trail meanders through the forest for 0.25 mile (0.4 km). It then joins a service road and continues to the right (west) for 1 mile (1.5 km) to the Natural Bridge. The short but steep switchback trail to the top of the bridge starts in front of the interpretive exhibit. Above the natural bridge, the trail crosses the creek through a narrow ravine and then continues along the cliff before rejoining the road.  This trail is closed from Autumn through early summer while bears feed on spawning trout in Bridge Creek."
"This easy trail is a short but diverse trail that travels through the forest to the lakeshore before looping back across the marsh along Pelican Creek to the trailhead. It is a scenic introduction to a variety of Yellowstone's habitats and is a good place for birding."
"This easy trail begins in the open meadows overlooking Indian Pond and Yellowstone Lake. It passes alongside the pond before turning right (west) into the forest. The trail continues through the trees and out to scenic, wind-swept Storm Point. The rocky area near the point is home to a large colony of yellow-bellied marmots. Following the shoreline to the west, the trail eventually loops back through the lodgepole forest and returns to Indian Pond.  The trail is often closed in late spring and early summer due to bear activity; inquire at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center about trail closures before hiking."
"This moderately strenuous trail climbs 800 feet (244 m) in 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through the dense lodgepole forest. After one mile, the trail splits into a loop. The left fork is the shortest route to the top, though both join again at the overlook. The overlook provides a sweeping panoramic view of Yellowstone Lake and surrounding area."
"This easy trail follows the Yellowstone River for a short distance before paralleling the service road. After leaving the road, the first two miles (3.2 km) meander through meadow, forest, and sage flats with frequent views of the river. The last mile (1.6 km) passes through a dense lodgepole pine forest before climbing gradually to an overview of LeHardys Rapids.  Those wanting a longer hike can continue to the Artist Point Road at Canyon, 12 miles [19 km] away, but that portion of the trail is not well maintained, requires a full day, and a car shuttle.  The trail is often closed due to bear activity; inquire at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center before hiking."
"This moderately easy travels through some of the best grizzly country in the lower 48 states—and also prime habitat for bison and other grassland animals. The trail heads north, crosses a few bridges through a meadow, then enters the forest. After it leaves the forest, it ascends a small hill to a nice overlook of the valley, with the creek below and the Absaroka Mountains to the east. From here, the trail turns slightly to the right (east) and passes through a small hydrothermal area. Stay on the trail through this fragile and hazardous area. Soon, the trail veers north (left), crosses a small creek, and climbs up a cutbank. This is a good place to rest and enjoy the nice views of Pelican Creek. One mile farther, the trail reaches a washed-out bridge. Beyond here the trail continues into Yellowstone's vast backcountry. The dayhike stops here; return by the same route.  Many restrictions apply to this trail because it is in prime grizzly bear habitat: the trail is closed until July 4th, is allowed for day-use only (9AM - 7PM), is recommended for groups of four or more hikers, and off-trail travel is prohibited on the first 2.5 miles (4 km).  Observe all bear-related precautions; be alert, make noise at blind curves and hills along the trail, and carry bear spray."
"This extremely strenuous, high-elevation trail is often snow-covered until July, so check at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center for current trail conditions.  Across the road from the parking area and to the right of the creek, the trail enters the forest and begins its steep ascent—2,100 feet in 2 miles (3.2 km). In just over a mile, it arrives at the base of the large bowl of Avalanche Peak, then continues to the left and switches back over large talus slopes to an open level area below the summit. Follow the established trail up to the narrow ridgeline and cross it with extreme caution. Those who make this arduous hike will be rewarded with stunning views of some of the park's tallest and most remote alpine peaks.  Return by the same route.  Grizzly bears frequent this area in the fall, seeking out whitebark pine nuts. Hiking this trail is not recommended in September and October. Be aware of lightning above treeline, and even on warm summer days bring rain gear, wool hats, and gloves.  Also note that burned trees may fall without warning."
"An easy boardwalk trail that is wheelchair accessible with assistance on slopes.  The trail offers a stroll through a geyser basin of colorful hot springs and dormant lake shore geysers situated on the scenic shores of Yellowstone Lake."
"The trail is moderately strenuous with a 400 foot elevation gain near overlook. Hike to a high mountain meadow for a commanding view of the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake and the distant Absaroka Mountains. The loop trail ascends steeply, passing backcountry thermal features, then gradually descends through meadows & forest."
"A moderately strenuous trail that climbs a small hill for a view of Duck and Yellowstone lakes and the expanse of the 1988 fires that swept through this area. Trail descends to shore of Duck Lake."
"An easy hike along a forest's edge and through open meadows to the shores of Yellowstone's largest backcountry lake. Look for sandhill cranes in meadows, moose near shore, and water birds on and near the lake. Beyond here the trail continues into Yellowstone's vast backcountry. The day hike stops here; return by the same route."
"An easy hike that crosses the Continental Divide and travels through small mountain meadows and forests to the shores of a picturesque little lake. Look for elk in the meadows and for birds near the lake. The trail is located in a bear management area and is closed until July 15; after July 15, groups of four or more people are recommended but not required."
"A moderately strenuous trail that gives you a feel for Yellowstone's backcountry. Hike through forest to the colorful waters of the Lewis River Channel. Look for eagles and ospreys fishing for trout in the shallow waters. Turn around here for the shorter trip or continue on a loop trail that takes you to Shoshone Lake and returns on the forested Dogshead Trail.  Beyond here the trail continues into Yellowstone's vast backcountry. The dayhike stops here; return by the same route."
"This moderately-strenuous trail gains 160 ft (48.8 m) of elevation with switchbacks that lead up the hill 0.5 miles (0.8 km) to a commanding view of the Upper Geyser Basin.  Return the same way or continue west to Solitary Geyser, which erupts frequently, then to the Geyser Hill boardwalk. The longer route is 1.4 miles."
"This moderately strenuous trail crosses the Firehole River, passes Pipeline Hot Springs, and climbs rolling hills of partially-burned lodgepole pine and open, rocky areas to the lake. Return the same way. (Or return via the Mallard Creek trail, for a total of 12 miles)"
"A moderately difficult trail that climbs a burned hill, continues through spruce-fir forest, then down to Lone Star Geyser. Return the same way."
"An pleasant, easy, partially paved trail follows an old service road beside the Firehole River to the geyser. Cyclists must dismount at the end of the asphalt and walk the last few hundred feet. Lone Star erupts up to 45 feet (13.7 m) from a 12-foot (3.6 m) cone approximately every three hours."
"This moderately strenuous trail crosses Spring Creek and climbs 735 ft (223 m) through mixed conifer forest to the Continental Divide. You can see Shoshone Lake from halfway up the trail."
"A moderately strenuous trail that follows a lovely creek through mixed conifer forest to the 70-foot falls, over which the Little Firehole River drops from the Madison Plateau. Turn around here or climb the switchbacks to an overlook of the Upper Geyser Basin, then loop back to the main trail. The trail passes through a bear management area and is closed until the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend."
"A strenuous trail that was originally designed as a winter ski trail.  The route follows hilly terrain through heavily burned forest up to Mallard Lake. Return the same way or, if you have arranged a car shuttle, follow the Mallard Lake Trail to the Old Faithful area."
"This easy trail travels through young forest 1.6 miles (2.6 km) to the 200-foot (61 m) falls. Continue 0.65 miles (1.05 km) past the falls through a wet area to Imperial Geyser, which has frequent minor eruptions. The trail travels through a bear management area and is closed until the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend."
"A moderately difficult trail that is very wet in spring and buggy in summer. The trail follows the Firehole River a short distance, then veers toward the meadows. Look for the large sinter mounds of hot springs and the remains of the old, incomplete bathhouse at Queen's Laundry, 1.9 miles (3.1 km) from the trailhead. Begun in 1881, construction was abandoned as park administrations and priorities changed. Minerals from the hot springs preserved the structure, which was the first building constructed by the government for public use in any national park. Queen's Laundry is a National Historic Site."
"This moderately difficult trail ascends 1500 ft (450m) through intermittent burned lodgepole pine forest and ends with a nice view of the Firehole Valley and lower Gibbon Valley; some views of the Madison Junction area are also visible."
"This is a gentle ascent through burned lodgepole pines to a small, marshy lake popular with mosquitos and waterfowl (but not harlequin ducks). Nice quick hike to escape the road for a little bit."
"This is a completely boardwalked trail that winds through burned lodgepole pine and sagebrush communities next to the Madison River. Good examples of fire recovery and regrowth as well as buffalo wallows. There are no interpretive signs or brochures other than the wayside exhibits at the trailheads."
"There are many excellent hiking opportunities in the Gallatin area. Most of these, however, are longer and steeper than the average day hike. They include Daily Creek, the Sky Rim, Black Butte, Specimen Creek, Crescent Lake/High Lake, Sportsman Lake, Bighorn Pass and Fawn Pass. For more information, consult a Visitor Center or one of the hiking trail guides available from the Yellowstone Association."
"This moderately difficult trail passes through a twice-burned lodgepole pine stand (1976 and 1988) and through nice meadows. The lake is long, narrow, and heavily wooded. It can be difficult to access beyond the trail end of the lake. Marshiness and mosquitos can make travel difficult early in the season. The lake is popular with anglers due to a strong population of small brook trout. A log jam crossing is required to continue past Grizzly Lake."
"An easy-to-moderate trail with one climb and descent of about 400 feet.  The trail follows Solfatara Creek for a short distance to the junction with Ice Lake Trail, it then parallels a power line for most of the way to Whiterock Springs. It climbs a short distance up to Lake of the Woods (difficult to find as it's off trail a bit) and passes Amphitheater Springs and Lemonade Creek (don't drink it). These are small, but pretty thermal areas in the otherwise non-descript lodgepole pine forest. The trail then continues on to meet the road. There is no trail connection back to the campground except the way you came. Parking a car at both ends is desirable. This is a good place to send folks who don't want to see many other hikers, but it can be under bear restrictions so check with rangers before setting out."
"This easy, handicapped accessible trail leads to a lovely, small lake nestled in the thick lodgepole pine forest. Some of the area was heavily burned in 1988. Hikers can continue from Ice Lake to Wolf Lake, Grebe Lake, and Cascade Lake, and then on to Canyon."
"This trail is moderately difficult due to stream crossings and downfall; the trail may be difficult to find at times.  The path follows the Gibbon River for at least 1 mile (1 km), passing Little Gibbon Falls. Dense, partially burned lodgepole pine forest is your main companion the rest of the way to Wolf Lake."
"This easy trail travels through intermittently burned lodgepole pine forest and past small marshy ephemeral ponds to the lush meadows surrounding Cygnet Lakes (small and boggy). Day use only! Trail not maintained beyond Cygnet Lakes."
"This easy trail is one of the overlooked yet wonderful short hikes of Yellowstone. The trail winds across a wet meadow on boardwalk then enters a partially burned lodgepole pine forest. The thermal area within the short loop at the end of the trail contains some of the most colorful hot springs and small geysers found in the area. Two mudpots at the top of the hill allow closer access than Fountain Paint Pots. Caution for flying mud! Remind folks to stay on the trail throughout the area.  The trail has one steep uphill/downhill section, and the trail erodes easily so may be rutted after rains."
"This trail is deceptively easy, then difficult.  It meanders along a gentle gradient following the Gibbon River then it turns sharply uphill and climbs 500 feet in 1/2 mile to the top of the mountain! Footing is on eroding geyserite and rhyolite, somewhat reminiscent of ball bearings. The geyser basin is a very interesting collection of dormant cones of varying sizes. One resembles a thermos bottle! Most of the activity here has dried up; hikers looking for exciting thermal activity will be disappointed, but those looking for adventure will find it. Remind folks to stay on trail!"
"This moderately strenuous trail starts just north of Liberty Cap and the Mammoth Terraces, and begins with a 350 foot (106.7 m) climb up and above Clematis Gulch. At the junction with Sepulcher Mountain Trail, go right. Soon thereafter, the trail levels out and rambles through meadows and stands of aspen to a series of beaver ponds. Look for elk, mule deer, pronghorn, moose, beaver dams and lodges, the occasional beaver, and waterfowl. Be alert for bears: both black and grizzly bears forage in this area. Past the ponds, the trail travels through forest and grassland back to Mammoth."
"This moderately strenuous trail climbs 1300 feet through forest and meadow to the summit of Bunsen Peak, which has panoramic views of the Blacktail Plateau, Swan Lake Flat, Gallatin Mountain Range, and the Yellowstone River Valley. (You'll also see communications equipment, which supplies Mammoth and nearby communities.) Return by the same route."
"A strenuous trail that follows Bunsen Peak Road (hiking/biking only) through grassland and burned forest 2.5 miles (4 km) to Osprey Falls Trail (no bikes allowed). Descend 700 feet (213 m) into Sheepeater Canyon, one of the deepest canyons in Yellowstone. Osprey Falls, on the Gardner River, plunges 150 feet (46 m) over the edge of a lava flow."
"A moderately strenuous trail that follows Lava Creek downstream past Undine Falls (60 feet/18 m), descending gradually. Lava Creek meets the Gardner River further downstream. The trail crosses the river on a footbridge to a final steep climb out, ending near the Mammoth Campground."
"A moderately strenuous trail that follows Blacktail Deer Creek Trail past the east end of Blacktail Pond to the top of a short hill, then veers left on the Rescue Creek Trail. Climb gradually through aspens and meadows, then descend through forests to sagebrush flats that lead to a footbridge across the Gardner River."
"A moderately strenuous trail that follows Blacktail Deer Creek as it descends 1,100 feet (33.5 m) through rolling, grassy hills and Douglas-fir forest to the Yellowstone River. Cross the river on a steel suspension bridge then join the Yellowstone River Trail, which continues downriver, passing Knowles Falls and into arid terrain until it ends in Gardiner, MT.  There is a very narrow, short stretch near Gardiner that is slippery when wet."
"This strenuous trail follows the Beaver Ponds Trail to the Sepulcher Mountain Trail junction, then climbs 3,400 feet (1,036 m) through forest and meadows to the 9,652 foot (2,942 m) summit. Loop trail continues along the opposite side of the mountain through an open slope to the junction of Snow Pass Trail, which descends to the Howard Eaton Trail, which goes north to Mammoth Terraces and the trailhead."
"A moderately difficult trail that offers views of Lost Lake, waterfowl, wet meadows, sagebrush hilltops, wildflowers, possibly beavers and quite often black bears. This trail begins behind Roosevelt Lodge and climbs 300 feet (91 m) onto the bench. Here it joins the Roosevelt horse trail and continues west to Lost Lake. From Lost Lake the trail follows the contour around the hillside to the Petrified Tree parking area, crosses the parking lot and continues up the hill. It loops behind Tower Ranger Station, crosses the creek and returns to the lodge. Caution: If you encounter horses, move to the downhill side of the trail and remain still until they have passed."
"A moderately difficult trail that follows the dirt stagecoach road about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the cookout shelter. Continues north along Elk Creek until nearly reaching the Yellowstone River. Here the trail divides, with the west fork joining the Hellroaring Trail and the east fork continuing around Garnet Hill and back toward Tower. Close to the road, the trail joins a horse trail that leads you to the Northeast Entrance Road. Walk along the road about one-fourth mile (400 m) back to the parking area."
"A strenuous trail that begins with a steep descent to the Yellowstone River Suspension Bridge, then crosses a sagebrush plateau, and drops down to Hellroaring Creek. Both the Yellowstone River and Hellroaring Creek are popular fishing areas.  Bring water as this trail can be hot and dry during the summer.  In addition, watch your footing on boulders by the river and be aware that other backcountry trails branch off of this one, so pay attention to trail signs.  An alternative route begins at Garnet Hill and continues west on Hellroaring trail; return to the Garnet Hill trailhead (distance 10 mi / 16 km)."
"A moderately difficult trail that climbs steeply to the east rim of the Narrows of the Yellowstone and then follows the rim. Look for peregrine falcons and osprey, which nest in the canyon, and bighorn sheep along the rim. View the Overhanging Cliff area, the towers of Tower Fall (the fall is not visible), basalt columns, and the historic Bannock Ford. The trail heads northeast; at the next trail junction turn left and descend to the road. (The Specimen Ridge Trail, strenuous and poorly marked, continues northeast.) Walk west along the road for 0.7 mile (1.1 km) to the Yellowstone River Picnic Area."
"A trail that is moderately strenuous for first 1.5 miles (2.4 km); then easy.  This long-distance trail follows a historic wagon trail into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness beyond Yellowstone. It begins with a steep climb then descends to the first meadow. Stop and relax here or continue to the second meadow. Be alert for bears and moose. Caution: If you encounter horses, move to the downhill side of the trail and remain still until they have passed."
"A strenuous trail that climbs 1400 feet(425 m).  Either trail ascends Mt. Washburn on a wide path with spectacular views. Look for bighorn sheep and wildflowers. Stay on the trail to avoid destroying fragile alpine vegetation. At the top, enjoy the view and interpretive exhibits inside the shelter at the base of the fire lookout. This is a high elevation trail: storms are common; bring rain gear, wool hats, and gloves."
"This modertely easy trail has very little rise and offers hikers the chance to choose their destination on a trail that passes through forest, meadow, and marsh: Cascade Lake (2.5 mi/ 4 km), Grebe Lake (4.25 mi/6.8 km), Wolf Lake (6.25 mi/10 km), Ice Lake (8.25 mi/13.3 km), and Norris Campground (12 mi/19.3 km). The trail can be wet and muddy through July with many biting insects."
"This strenuous trail has a 1400 ft (425 m) vertical rise in 3 miles (4.8 km) on its way to a high mountain peak that offers an outstanding view of the Yellowstone wilderness. The trail passes through open meadows to Cascade Lake (described on back of handout). Beyond the lake, it climbs 1400 feet in three miles through whitebark pine forest. Past Cascade Lake, no water is available."
"This easy walk allows people with limited time to enjoy open meadows where wildflowers abound and wildlife is often seen. The trail can be wet and muddy through July with many biting insects."
"This moderately easy trail has little vertical rise as it follows an old fire road through meadows and forest, some of which burned in 1988. At the lake you can connect with the Howard Eaton Trail or return the way you came."
"A strenuous trail that follows the canyon rim for the first 1.5 miles (2.4 km), offering views of Silver Cord Cascade across the canyon. In another half mile the trail joins the Washburn Spur Trail; after another 3 miles it turns right onto the trail to Seven Mile Hole, which drops more than 1,000 feet in 1.5 miles (2.4 km).  Be especially careful where the trail passes both dormant and active hot springs."
"This strenuous trail rises 1400 ft (425 m).  Starting at either trailhead, you ascend Mt. Washburn on a wide trail with spectacular views. Look for bighorn sheep (keep your distance) and wildflowers. Stay on the trail to avoid destroying fragile alpine vegetation. At the top, enjoy the view and interpretive exhibits from inside the shelter at the base of the fire lookout. Caution: Storms are common; bring rain gear, wool hats, and gloves."
"A strenuous trail that rises 2000 ft (607 m) in 2.5 miles (4 km).  After ascending Mount Washburn, begin the spur trail from the east side of the fire lookout. The trail descends very steeply over rough terrain for 3.7 miles (6 km) to Washburn Hot Springs. Caution: Stay on the trail in this hydrothermal area. Continue south, passing the turnoff to Seven Mile Hole and ending at the Glacial Boulder pullout on the road to Inspiration Point. The trail is in very poor condition."

"Lodge rooms are located in the Cascade and Dunraven Lodges, both built in the 1990s while the cabins were all constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. All lodging includes private bath. Open from early June through late September."
"The Grant Village lodging options consist of two six story buildings containing fifty rooms each. This hotel complex provides the basic amenities without some of the flair of the Old Faithful Inn but at prices that are a bit lower, and Grant Village may have greater availability due to the number of rooms available there. There is a post office nearby, as well as a cafeteria, a soda-jerk diner, and a sandwich shop in the complex, as well as a reservations-only restaurant serving local fare. Even if you decide not to eat at the restaurant, do go in to check out the large array of beautiful photographs taken by one of the long-time Yellowstone Maintenance heads, who is also one of the park photographers. Open late May through late September."
"All units include private bath including shower. The Western cabins are the most modern, the frontier cabins were built in the 1920s but recently refurbished, and the pioneer cabins were built in the 1920s and have not been recently refurbished. Open mid-June through late September."
"This hotel is listed on the register of historic places and located right on Lake Yellowstone (there's a boat pier and a restaurant right on the edge of the lake). The Lake Yellowstone Hotel and Cabins provide a rustic experience that probably won't excite a luxury traveler, but the staff provides the basics - decent rooms, reasonably good food, and breathtaking views of the lake and its surroundings. Watch out for mosquitos especially as you walk near the lake in mornings and afternoons in the summer, they come out in swarms, but DEET or similar mosquito repellant will keep them away. Open mid-May through late September."
"The only in-park lodging that is open year-round. The hotel offers rooms both with a private bath or with a shared bath. Another option is to stay in the many cabins located next to the hotel (summer only), also with private or shared bath; hot tub cabins are also available for a premium price. For hikers just looking to clean up, showers are available for $3.25 (inquire and pay fee in advance at front desk)."
"A national historic site, this rustic hotel was originally constructed entirely of logs during the winter of 1903. The original 120 rooms were expanded with the addition of the east wing in 1913, and the west wing was added in 1927. Major renovations were done from 2004 - 2008 to improve infrastructure and shore up the building's supports while also reverting some past modifications to bring the inn closer to its original design. Today it is the largest log hotel in the world, and the vast lobby incorporates large tree trunks as pillars and a stone fireplace. Accommodations range from rooms with shared bathrooms and showers nearby to suites with private bathrooms and refrigerators. Open from mid-May through mid-October."
"Frontier cabins offer private bath (including shower) while the budget cabins offer communal showers in the lodge with toilet and sink facilities located nearby the cabins. Large windows in the lobby face Old Faithful Geyser. Gift shop, restaurants, bakery. Open from mid-May through late September."
"This lodge is one of only two winter lodging options within the park. All lodging options have private bath including shower. The western cabins were built in 1989 while the frontier cabins are simpler. Open December through March and May through October."
"Frontier cabins offer two double beds and private bathroom with shower. The Roughrider Cabins are sparsely furnished and heated with wood burning stoves (two ""presto"" logs are provided) and offer communal showers and shared bathrooms. Open mid-June through early September."

"Located adjacent to Canalside, the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park opened in 1977 and consists of three historic warships: the USS ''Little Rock'', a cruiser which served in the Mediterranean Sea during the Cold War as a flagship for the Second and Sixth Fleets of the U.S. Navy and is now the only guided missile cruiser in the country on display; the USS ''The Sullivans'', a destroyer that saw intense action in the Pacific theater of World War II; and the USS ''Croaker'', a submarine that also saw action in the Pacific during WWII. These ships are open for self-guided tours during the warm months. There is also a museum on site that displays memorabilia such as Medals of Honor awarded to area residents."
"A 501(c)(3) educational non-profit organization, the mission of the Western New York Book Arts Center (WNYBAC) is, in the words of its website, to ""promote, encourage and develop the printing and book arts through education and access for individual artists and underserved communities"". Presented at the WNYBAC are permanent exhibits detailing the history of printmaking, writing, bookbinding and related crafts, temporary shows featuring the work of local writers, artists and illustrators, and workshops that educate individuals and groups on techniques in bookbinding, papermaking, screen printing, and letterpress. The WNYBAC also holds Open Studios twice monthly for local artisans to work on their own projects."
"The shipping industry was greatly important to Buffalo's economy in earlier times, and the Lower Lakes Marine Historical Society's mission is to pay tribute to, and increase awareness and appreciation of, that facet of local history. To that end, a wide variety of historic artifacts, old photographs, models, and interpretive materials relevant to the Great Lakes shipping trade are displayed in a warm and airy museum located in what was once the offices of Howard H. Baker and Company, a ship chandlery that served Buffalo Harbor in the 19th Century."
"Mark Twain lived in Buffalo for a short period at the beginning of his career, from 1869 to 1871; though not his most prolific period as a writer, it was during his time as editor and co-owner of the ''Buffalo Morning Express'' that he courted and married his wife Olivia and fathered his first child. Today, at the '''Central Library''' on Lafayette Square, there's a small exhibit space that displays a range of memorabilia related to the iconic author and humorist, including most famously the original manuscript of ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' handwritten by Twain in 1885. In addition, you can see a collection of English and foreign-language editions of ''Huck Finn'' gradually amassed by the Library beginning in the 1930s, as well as the restored mantel that once stood in Twain's handsome mansion at 472 Delaware Avenue in present-day Allentown (destroyed by fire in 1963). The Mark Twain Room is open whenever the Central Library is open; it's on the first floor of the building, on the right side of the corridor as you walk past the escalators."
"Erected in 1907 in commemoration of the assassination of President William McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition exactly six years prior, this gleaming 96-foot (29 m) obelisk of Vermont marble anchors '''Niagara Square''' at the focal point of Joseph Ellicott's 1807 radial street plan. The McKinley Monument was designed by Carrere and Hastings, the same architects in charge of the Exposition; the lions and turtles resting at its base (symbols, respectively, of strength and eternal life) were carved by well-known sculptor A. Phimister Proctor. The monument was also the subject of Carl Sandburg's poem ""Slants at Buffalo, New York""."
"Designed by architect George Kellar of Hartford, Connecticut with bronze reliefs by Caspar Buberl, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument is the centerpiece of '''Lafayette Square''', a granite shaft that stands 85 feet (25 m) tall. Talk of a Civil War memorial monument (originally intended to be located at '''Soldier's Place''' in the Delaware District) had begun as early as 1866, but it was not until 1884 when the '''Ladies' Union Monument Association''' finally effected its construction. Soon after its dedication it was noted that, due to the uneven settlement of its foundation, the monument was tilted and was structurally unsound; it was dismantled, rebuilt, and rededicated five years later. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument was thoroughly restored in 1982."
"Located in the Theater District inside of '''Hostel Buffalo Niagara''', BOX Gallery was opened in September 2014 by the hostel's general manager, Jon Piret, in conjunction with local artist Jeffrey Vincent, as a home for temporary exhibitions by local artists. At BOX Gallery you'll find innovative work by neophytes and veterans of the local scene alike, often synthesizing multiple different media. As well, there's a performance space for musicians, dancers, and performance artists."
"Located in the historic and architecturally stunning '''Market Arcade''' in the Theater District and funded by CEPA members as well as charitable foundations, the CEPA Gallery's mission, according to its website, is ""to present contemporary photo-related art, to support working artists, and to promote a greater understanding of photography and its associated aesthetic and cultural issues"", with a particular focus on the work of local photographers as well as those who come from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in the field. To that end, exhibitions of work by CEPA members and others are frequently held in the gallery space."
"Founded in 1974 on the West Side by a collective of visual artists that includes such future luminaries of the Buffalo arts scene as Diane Bertolo, Charles Clough, and Robert Longo, Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center has operated since 2006 in Babeville, the complex created by Ani DiFranco in the redeveloped '''Asbury United Methodist Church'''. With a mission of creating and making available to the public new works in a diversity of genres of contemporary art, Hallwalls operates a large exhibition gallery that features a permanent collection as well as temporary exhibitions of works by local artists, as well as a screening room and performance space. As well, Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center is a dedicated advocate for local artists on issues such as funding for the arts and freedom of expression."
"Opened in January 2016 in the former home of '''MAIN(ST)UDIOS''', the Main St. Gallery represents a proud continuation of its predecessor's dedication to the downtown arts community that has coalesced around the 500 Block of Main Street. In this large, two-story combination art gallery and performance space, curator Cole Pawlowski hosts a diverse range of temporary art exhibitions as well as live music, poetry readings, and even film screenings and theatrical pieces."
"A work of local artist Casey Riordan Millard, ''Shark Girl'' is a life-size fiberglass statue of a young girl with an old-fashioned blue dress, bright red shoes, and a great white shark for a head that's been perplexing — and polarizing — visitors to Canalside since it was unveiled in 2014, borne of a partnership between the city government and the '''Albright-Knox Art Gallery''' aimed at promoting works of public art around Buffalo. Shark Girl is a recurring character in Millard's repertoire of paintings and drawings — a representation, she says, of ""the existential conundrums of life, love, family, and loss"". She sits atop a boulder on one of the whipple-truss bridges over the restored canal."
"Located in the Theater District and operated by the Learning Disabilities Association of Western New York, Starlight Studio is a gallery and studio that showcases works by artists with disabilities. With a rotating collection on display of works by member artists, frequent temporary exhibitions, and display space available for rent to the community, the overarching goal of Starlight Studio is to support the creative expression and artistic development of adults with disabilities."
"In the 19th Century, ""The Big Ditch"" was a popular name for the Erie Canal, which, over the course of only a few decades, took Buffalo from a sleepy frontier backwater to one of America's foremost industrial centers. In much the same way, the Big Ditch Brewing Company's name pays homage to its role in the revival of Buffalo's proud brewing tradition, which was all but dead after the closure of '''Iroquois Brewing''' in 1972 but now comprises a growing legion of locally-owned craft microbreweries like the brand-new one on East Huron Street where they operate. During retail hours, Big Ditch's staff leads craft beer lovers on free tours of their production floor, where folks can watch two batches of beer a day get brewed, fermented, carbonated, and racked into kegs. Afterward, head over to the attached tap room and restaurant to sample the finished product."
"Situated on 20 acres (8 ha) of formerly idle land at the harbor, Canalside combines the celebration and preservation of Buffalo's rich history as a rough-and-tumble canal town with an expansion of waterfront recreational opportunities for Buffalonians of today to enjoy. At Canalside, amenities such as tour boats offering cruises of the harbor, river, and lake, a lengthy slate of festivals, and one of the city's favorite new restaurants ('''Liberty Hound''') can be enjoyed in an environment that also pays tribute to history with features such as a recreation of the '''Commercial Slip''' — once the western end of the mighty Erie Canal — on the side of which are the restored foundations of old Canal District buildings, dating to the mid-19th century and rediscovered in the early 2000s. As well, a restored canal bridge, interpretive plaques, and the enthralling Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park are on the scene. With further expansion of the offerings slated for the near future, such as two new hotels, a children's museum, a sports complex, and restaurants and shops, Canalside is only going to get better as time goes on."
"Much more than just a place to park boats, the Erie Basin Marina is popular with Buffalo residents during the summer as a place to walk, jog or bike, enjoy an ice cream cone and cool lake breezes, or just relax and watch the people go by. A longtime fixture on Buffalo's waterfront, the Erie Basin Marina is located next to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park, the Canalside redevelopment, the Waterfront Village Condominiums, and the Buffalo Light, which was built in 1833 and is the oldest existing building in Buffalo still on its original site. The marina also boasts such amenities as a snack bar and ice cream shop ('''The Hatch'''), an upscale restaurant ('''Templeton Landing'''), a waterfront boardwalk that provides access to the small Emerald Beach, and an observation tower that boasts excellent views of downtown, the West Side waterfront, Elevator Alley, Lake Erie, the Niagara River, and Canada. Also located here are the '''Erie Basin Marina Gardens''', whose 200 different species of plants come into bloom each spring and summer along Erie Street and which serve not only as a delightful attraction for visitors but also as a test garden for floral and seed companies to experiment with growing their plants in a Northeastern climate."
"As mentioned before, Niagara Square is the center of Joseph Ellicott's original radial street plan for Buffalo, which makes the 360-degree panoramic views available from the 28th floor of {{marker|type=see|name=Buffalo City Hall|lat=42.886631|long=-78.879278}} — the second-tallest building in Buffalo — all the more impressive. Guests take the elevator as far as the 25th floor, then ascend a stairwell for the remaining three floors, and are then rewarded with unparalleled views over Buffalo and its surroundings, Lake Erie, and Canada. On clear days, the mist from Niagara Falls can be seen over the northern horizon."
"Since 1940, on the closest Sunday to March 17th, downtown Buffalo, as well as Allentown, has been the scene of New York State's second-largest St. Patrick's Day celebration, held by the '''Buffalo United Irish-American Association'''. Traditionally, Mass is said by the Bishop of Buffalo at '''St. Joseph's Cathedral''' on Franklin Street immediately before the participants gather at '''Niagara Square''', marching up Delaware Avenue as far as North Street. The grandeur of this event is testimony to the continuing importance of Buffalo's Irish-American community."
"Since 1986, Buffalo Place has hosted this long-running series of free summer outdoor concerts downtown, every Thursday evening from early June through early August. Originally known as ""Thursday at the Square"" and held at Lafayette Square in the heart of downtown, in 2011 event organizers responded to the increasingly large crowd sizes by moving the second half of the schedule to the much larger Canalside area. The entire series is now held at Canalside, with the name change made official that year. Evolving from its humble beginnings as mainly a showcase for local bands, Thursday at the Harbor has grown to host internationally known artists and groups such as Blues Traveler, Parliament/Funkadelic, the Violent Femmes, Hootie and the Blowfish, They Might Be Giants, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and dozens more, and is also well-known for regularly showcasing Canadian acts such as Sam Roberts, the Lowest of the Low, Sloan, and 54-40. In addition to the free concerts, Buffalo Place also presents several top-tier acts a year at Canalside as part of '''Buffalo Place Rocks the Harbor''', with admission charges of $10 for advance purchases and $20 on the day of the show."
"Every year since 1984, the first weekend of July has seen foodies descend on Niagara Square and the few blocks of Delaware Avenue north of there for the two-day Taste of Buffalo festival, where Buffalo's most popular restaurants offer samples of their finest dishes to the public. Local wineries often show up to showcase their vintages, and food demonstrations and even live music are also on hand to please 450,000 festival attendees from all over Upstate New York, Southern Ontario, and Northwest Pennsylvania."
"The Buffalo Irish Festival has taken place at various locations downtown for 31 years running; as of 2012 it seems to have found a permanent home at Canalside. Beginning with a parade that features the proud flags of each of the 32 counties of Ireland, these three days of revelry in late August see the historic cobblestone streets near the harbor ringing with performances of traditional Irish folk music, step-dancing and theatrical productions, and full of shops and stands selling Irish-made handicrafts and imported food and drink. Genealogical experts are on hand to guide those interested in tracing family roots, raffles and souvenirs are offered, and Sunday Mass is conducted in both English and Gaelic."
"Each Labor Day weekend sees Coca-Cola Field in downtown Buffalo host the National Buffalo Wing Festival, two days dedicated to Buffalo's best-known addition to the annals of American cuisine. Inspired by the 2001 movie ""Osmosis Jones"" as well as a column by iconic ''Buffalo News'' editorialist Donn Esmonde, the National Buffalo Wing Festival has, since its inception, drawn nearly 600,000 hungry guests from all 50 states and 33 foreign countries to Buffalo, who have collectively eaten over 3 million chicken wings and raised over $200,000 for various local charities. Showcased by a long list of national media such as ""The Today Show"", ""The View"", ""Live with Regis and Kelly"", numerous Food Network series, and even a PBS documentary, the National Buffalo Wing Festival sees over 30 restaurants in Buffalo and around the country — including the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were first served in 1964 — serve up their individual recipes and compete for prizes."
"Curtain Up! takes place in mid-September, when downtown Buffalo's Theater District toasts the opening of the theater season with a slate of new shows generating excitement anew among Buffalo's theater fans. Opening performances in the various theaters are preceded by a gala black-tie dinner at Shea's Performing Arts Center and followed by an outdoor party on Main Street that is open to the public."
"For three days in mid-September, '''Canalside''' celebrates Buffalo's history as one of the most important inland ports in North America as a sort of grand finale to the summer festival season on the waterfront. At the Buffalo Maritime Festival, visits to the harbor asre paid by famous ships that, in recent years, have included the tugboat ''DeWitt Clinton'', the schooner ''Lynx'' out of Newport Beach, California, and even the ''USS Niagara'', the warship commanded by Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry in the War of 1812. Tours of some of the boats are offered, as well as a children's parade, a chowder competition, a beer tent, food and drink, and live music. Admission and most activities are free."
"The largest event of its kind in the world, the World's Largest Disco brings back the 1970s for one day each Thanksgiving Day weekend, with the {{marker|type=do|name=Buffalo Niagara Convention Center|lat=42.887022|long=-78.875807}} transformed into New York State's largest dance floor. Every year, thousands of locals and visitors age 21 and over dance the night away to the retro tunes that are played on the festival's 500,000-watt soundsystem, and have the chance to meet disco-era celebrities that have included Henry Winkler, Erik Estrada, Leif Garrett, and the cast of ""The Brady Bunch"". The World's Largest Disco has been featured on the front page of the ''Wall Street Journal'' as well as such television programs as ""CBS This Morning"", VH-1's ""Where Are They Now"", and the Travel Channel's ""Secrets"". All proceeds go to benefit Camp Good Days and Special Times, a local summer camp for children with cancer."
"In addition to serving as the official opening of the ice skating season at the '''Rotary Rink''' at '''Fountain Plaza''', the lighting of downtown Buffalo's Christmas tree has unofficially kicked off the holiday season in the local area since 1984. Immediately after the tree lighting, the crowd can enjoy an exciting fireworks display over Fountain Plaza, followed by horse and wagon rides, clowns and balloon art, face-painting, skating at the Rotary Rink, and, of course, visits with Santa Claus."
"A drug- and alcohol-free New Year's celebration, First Night is a celebration that takes place in various cities in the United States. Beginning in Boston in 1976, First Night made its way to Buffalo in 1989. In addition to the ""ball drop"" that takes place at the stroke of midnight from the top of the Niagara Mohawk Building (second in annual attendance in the U.S. only to the famous Times Square ball drop in New York City), live music can be had downtown; other venues around the city present a diversity of free entertainment such as poetry, dance, comedy, puppet shows, and other performing arts, as well as activities for children such as bounce houses and jungle gyms."
"A new tradition that takes place in early January, the Buffalo Soup Fest sees Buffalonians stave off the cold of winter with hot, hearty bowls of soup, all to benefit a variety of worthwhile causes. This offbeat but popular festival was inaugurated in 2011, and spent its first few years bouncing around various venues in suburbia before growing crowds forced it to relocate to the '''Buffalo Niagara Convention Center''' in 2014. At the Buffalo Soup Fest, over 30 vendors representing restaurants, food trucks, and specialty shops from all over the Niagara Frontier compete for 17 different prizes, while youngsters can enjoy the Oogie Games ""Kid's Corner"" with video games. The '''Brooklyn Brewery Soup Challenge''' was also inaugurated as part of the 2014 festival, where competing restaurants create new soups using beer as an ingredient."
"The Buffalo Winterfest is a way for Buffalonians to, in the words of festival organizers, ""thumb... [their] frosted noses at the wintry misconceptions and stereotypes that pervade the national consciousness"" with a celebration of the winter season. After being held at a diversity of venues around town, Winterfest moved to a new permanent home at '''Canalside''' for its 2015 iteration, with events taking place at '''HarborCenter''' and the canalside ice rinks across the way. Events include a Buffalo Historical Hike, the Police vs. Fire Olympics, a snowman-building competition, ice sculptures, dogsled demonstrations, and more. Proceeds benefit the '''Buffalo Police Benevolent Association'''."
"The Buffalo Bandits have been a member of the National Lacrosse League (and its predecessor, the Major Indoor Lacrosse League) since 1992. Buffalo's most successful sports team in recent years, the Bandits won the league championship in 1992, 1993, 1996, and 2008, as well as the divisional championship in 1994, 2004, 2006 and 2011. Games are played at the {{marker|type=do|name=KeyBank Center|lat=42.875006|long=-78.876607}} downtown from December through April. Tickets to these family-friendly events are affordable and easily available."
"The city's newest sports team made its debut in 2015, playing ice hockey in the National Women's Hockey League at '''HarborCenter''', just across the street from the KeyBank Center."
"After several years as an affiliate of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, as of September 2012 the Bisons are now the AAA farm team of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Bisons won the International League pennant in 1933, 1936, 1957, 1961, 1998, and 2004, and the American Association pennant in 1997. Bisons baseball games are a great place to see up-and-coming talent before it makes the big leagues, and their home stadium, {{marker|type=do|name=Coca-Cola Field|lat=42.880348|long=-78.873767}}, hosted the AAA All-Star Game in 1988 and 2012. Coca-Cola Field is a ""new classic"" ballpark, built in 1988 by HOK (now known as Populous), the renowned firm that went on to build '''Camden Yards''' in Baltimore. Seats are usually available and cheap, and provide a great view of downtown."
"Member of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Buffalo Sabres advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in 1975 and 1999 and, in 2007, won the Presidents' Trophy for the best win/loss record in the NHL. The Sabres' home games at the '''KeyBank Center''' sell out on a regular basis."
"The 716ers made their debut in the Premier Basketball League in 2013 under the tutelage of head coach, owner, and proud Buffalo native Tawan Slaughter. Games take place from December through March in the {{marker|type=do|name=Burt Flickinger Athletic Center|lat=42.881565|long=-78.871205}} at '''Erie Community College''''s City Campus. Tickets are a steal at $7 apiece."
"The Ice at Canalside is New York State's largest outdoor ice rink, two and a half times the size of a regulation hockey surface and three times the size of the skating rink at '''Rockefeller Center''' in Manhattan. Located on the new northern extension of the '''Commercial Slip''' — the site of both the Erie Canal terminus and the playing surface at the old '''Memorial Auditorium''' (a special insignia on the surface of the rink pays homage to the Buffalo Sabres' former home ice) — the Ice at Canalside opened just in time for the start of the 2014-15 skating season, and also hosts broomball, curling, and other winter pastimes. Skates and ""ice bikes"" are available for rent as well. In summer, the Ice at Canalside is converted to a lovely reflecting pool, with old-fashioned whipple-truss bridges crossing over the water that evoke the bygone days of the Erie Canal."
"When they're not being used for '''Buffalo Sabres''' practice sessions or '''Buffalo Beauts''', '''Buffalo Junior Sabres''', '''Canisius Golden Griffins''', or '''Erie Community College Kats''' hockey games, the two indoor NHL-sized rinks on the sixth floor of the '''HarborCenter''' at Canalside occasionally host public skates. See the HarborCenter website for a schedule of open times and ticket purchasing information."
"Named for the Rotary Club whose $500,000 donation made its construction possible, the Rotary Rink has, since 1991, provided city residents with a unique opportunity to ice skate outdoors in an urban setting just steps from the Theater District, Chippewa Street, and downtown hotels and attractions. Skating at the Rotary Rink is very popular during winter events downtown such as the Christmas Tree Lighting, the New Year's Eve ball drop, and Winterfest, with the rink open extended hours during those times."
"Launched in 2013, BFLO Harbor Kayak has grown into a Canalside institution that offers locals and visitors a brand-new way to get up close and personal with downtown Buffalo's waterfront: on your very own (rented) kayak! The format is decidedly freeform: after a brief introductory talk on oar gripping, seating, and other mechanics of kayaking, you're set loose into the water to explore Canalside, the '''Naval Park''', and the elevators of the Buffalo River at your leisure — just make sure you're back when your time is up. Stand-up paddleboarding — a watersport imported from Hawaii that's perhaps best described as surfing with an oar — is also offered, as are guided historical tours of the harbor and the Buffalo River (check website for details on those). Keep in mind that BFLO Harbor Kayak is one of the most popular activities offered at Canalside, with waits of three hours or more not uncommon on balmy summer weekends, so arrive early and plan accordingly as no advance reservations are taken."
"Courtesy of '''Water Bikes of Buffalo''' (see below), both young and old can cruise their way around the rebuilt Canalside canals on their choice of six adult-size paddleboats or 12 child-size double-passenger boats. Boats are rented for 20-minute intervals on a first-come-first-served basis from the kiosk at the east end of the canals, adjacent to Main Street. Life vests are provided free of charge and, even though the water is only 18 inches (45 cm) deep, are mandatory for all ages."
"The miniature remote-control sailboats you see puttering around the rewatered Erie Canal were inspired by the model boat races that have long taken place at '''Conservatory Pond''' in Manhattan's Central Park, and Canalside is still the only other place in the world that has them. As you stand alongside the edge of the water, you use the remote-control unit that the folks at Sail the Canal give you to adjust your boat's sail and rudder — but as with a real sailboat, the wind does all the rest of the work. For that extra touch of authenticity, they'll even sell you a captain's hat."
"A ""water bike"" is a contraption that looks rather like two parallel kayaks with a bike frame, pedals and handlebars suspended between them, and Water Bikes of Buffalo has ten of them (plus one tandem ""waterpillar"") docked at the far southeast corner of Canalside. What a unique way to explore the downtown waterfront, the hulking grain elevators of the lower Buffalo River, and the handsome, historic Buffalo Lighthouse. Water bikers must be at least 8 years old and at least 48 inches (122 cm) in height, and children must be accompanied by an adult 18 years of age or older."
"During the warm months, the ''Miss Buffalo II'' takes visitors on their choice of three sightseeing cruises that cover various parts of Buffalo's waterfront. The basic '''Narrated Sightseeing Cruise''' takes in the sights along the upper Niagara River including the old Buffalo Light, the Black Rock Canal, and (on the opposite side of the river) Old Fort Erie. The '''Historic Buffalo River Tour''' explores Buffalo's mighty industrial past with a visit to the old Erie Canal terminus and ""Elevator Alley"", a stretch of the Buffalo River adjacent to the harbor that is lined with historic grain elevators. The '''Landmark Tour''' uses Buffalo's scenic harbor as a base to explore the magnificent architectural landmarks of downtown. Tours leave from the Erie Basin Marina rain or shine. Parties, corporate events, and private charters are also available."
"The ''Moondance'' is a 51-foot catamaran that offers two-hour cruises on Lake Erie. Four cruises depart daily from Erie Basin Marina, and passengers can take advantage of an open bar, sound system, and ample space for sunbathing. Group charters and banquet packages are available."
"Debuting in 2011, the Queen City Ferry runs a water taxi service seasonally that takes visitors around Buffalo's scenic and historic harbor. Tours leave every hour on the hour from the main dock at Central Wharf in Canalside, heading to '''Buffalo RiverFest Park''' in the Old First Ward and then to '''Wilkeson Pointe''' on the Outer Harbor. If you're planning your cruise for the evening, pay attention to the Outer Harbor Concert Series schedule: on days when there's a show, regular service is suspended after 5PM so they can ferry people over to the concert site."
"Serene and scenic cruises on Lake Erie and around the harbor are to be had on the ''Spirit of Buffalo'', an unmissable 73-foot schooner that affords them the opportunity to experience a trip aboard a traditional 19th-century sailing vessel. Day cruises, sunset sails, and a '''Wednesday ""Wine in the Wind"" Cruise''' featuring local vintages from the Niagara Peninsula are all offered; kids love the '''Pirate Cruises''' that sail on Saturdays and Sundays. All cruises leave from the Commercial Slip at Canalside. Private charters are available as well."
"Located in a striking Art Moderne building in the heart of the Theater District that once housed Buffalo's Greyhound bus station, the Alleyway Theatre presents a full slate of plays and musicals year-round in a comfortable and intimate setting. Popular features of the Alleyway Theatre's annual schedule include ""Buffalo Quickies"" (a festival of one-act plays by local writers), the Maxim Mazumdar New Play Competition, and the theater's annual presentation of Charles Dickens' ''A Christmas Carol'' each December. The Alleyway is also home to '''Theatre Plus''', a troupe that puts on musicals, plays, dance performances, and other such fare, geared toward and performed by women."
"Housed at the {{marker|type=do|name=Andrews Theatre|lat=42.891070|long=-78.872324}} in the Theater District, the Irish Classical Theatre Company was founded in 1990 by a pair of brothers from Dublin with a mission ""to present the greatest works of dramatic literature: international classics; modern plays of exceptional merit; and Irish plays, both traditional and contemporary... at the highest level of artistic excellence for the public of Buffalo, Western New York and Southern Ontario, and subsequently, for national and international audiences."" Despite its name, the Irish Classical Theatre has a broad and international focus; over the course of its history, the company has presented performances by the late French mime Marcel Marceau, the renowned Polish dramatist Kazimierz Braun, and Buffalo native Jesse L. Martin, whose work includes performances in the Broadway musical ''Rent'' and the television series ''Law & Order''."
"Located on Pearl Street in what was once the Buffalo Christian Center's '''Forbes Theater''', Road Less Traveled has as its goal the development and production of works by playwrights of local extraction. Its in-house program for developing local talent, the Emanuel Fried New Play Workshop, has been of especial assistance in Road Less Traveled's recent initiative to better reflect the increasingly diversified identity of Western New York in order to present local audiences with a picture of their world that is as true-to-life as possible, and to capture the interest of young people and others who may be new to the experience of live theatre. Additionally, Road Less Traveled Theatre often presents theatrical productions of exceptional quality by dramatists from outside the region."
"The most exciting news to hit the Theater District recently was the reopening of the former '''Studio Arena Theatre''', which was one of the oldest resident theatres in the United States and Buffalo's only professional regional theatre at the time of its closure in 2008 due to financial difficulties. Now operated by Shea's Performing Arts Center in partnership with a variety of other local, regional, and college theatre institutions, the newly renamed 710 Main Theatre is operational once again as a presenting theatre where an assortment of productions are performed for the enjoyment of local audiences. The theatre is also available for private and corporate events."
"Located in an dazzlingly ornate former movie palace that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Shea's Performing Arts Center has been the cornerstone of downtown Buffalo's Theater District since the late 1970s, when its opening thwarted plans by civic leaders to demolish the grand old building. Today, Shea's is Buffalo's premier venue for lavish Broadway-style musicals such as ''Dreamgirls'', ''The Lion King'', and ''Wicked'', as well as live music and performances such as ""Sesame Street Live"" and the ""Radio City Christmas Spectacular"". The Mighty Wurlitzer organ, installed in the theater in 1926 to provide musical accompaniment to silent movies, is also occasionally dusted off for performances of various types."
"Next door to the main Shea's building is the Smith Theatre, a cabaret-style venue that presents fare that is quirkier and more locally-focused as opposed to major national touring productions. The Smith Theatre hosts a diversity of fare, including stand-up comedy sets and off-Broadway-style material that's often written and performed by Buffalo-area natives."
"Founded in 1985, Squeaky Wheel is a nonprofit, grassroots, artist-run media arts center that periodically screens locally-produced independent and avant-grade film and video projects."
"Ani DiFranco is the locally-based musician and record company honcho who was responsible for saving the historic '''Asbury United Methodist Church''' from demolition in 1996 and transforming it into ""Babeville"", a complex that encompasses the headquarters of her record label, Righteous Babe Records, Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center's gallery and screening room, and the concert venue Asbury Hall. Located in the sanctuary of the former church, Asbury Hall is a 1,000-capacity venue that hosts live performances of music that trends heavily toward folky indie singer-songwriters, in many cases from Righteous Babe Records' stable of artists. Comedy, variety shows, and other events are also held regularly at Asbury Hall."
"The home of the NHL's Buffalo Sabres is also Buffalo's venue of choice for first-tier national and international musical acts, as well as touring shows such as Cirque du Soleil and WWE wrestling."
"Famous for boasting the ""Finest in Underground Rock Since 1990"" until its closure in January 2013, Mohawk Place is back and better than ever. Or, perhaps better said, it's just ""back"" — aside from a new floor, a few touch-ups to the original tin ceiling, and a bar that's more consistently well-stocked than before, new owner Rick Platt has kept the place true to its divey, eccentric roots, to the delight of the local musicians and fans who considered the place almost a second home. Mohawk Place's previous iteration was known to book the occasional nationally-known touring act and was beloved for such annual events as the Irving Klaws Halloween Party, the Annual Joe Strummer Tribute Show, and The Smiths vs. The Cure Dance Party; at this early date there's no word on whether any of that will continue to be the case, but the punk, metal, and hard rock scene in Buffalo is glad all the same to have the place open again."
"The jewel of downtown Buffalo's Theater District, Shea's is a midsize venue that features live music of various genres alongside its usual slate of Broadway shows, stand-up comedy acts, and other touring shows."
"Once a Prohibition-era speakeasy that was Al Capone's favorite Buffalo hangout, the Town Ballroom has been reborn as one of the city's premiere venues for nationally famous pop, rock and hip-hop acts to strut their stuff. The upcoming concerts at the Town Ballroom as of this writing — hip-hop veterans Cypress Hill, Canadian alt-rockers Billy Talent, metalcore favorites Killswitch Engage, and jam band Umphrey's McGee — are indicative of the caliber and range of groups that perform there."
"Celebrating its 30th Anniversary in 2012, this Theater District mainstay started out as a small jazz club but has branched out into roots, rock, soul, R&B, and world music with an emphasis on mid-level national acts as well as local bands."
"Located in the heart of the Theater District, the Tudor Lounge has spent the past few years steadily transforming itself from a divey blue-collar watering hole to one of the best places in Buffalo to see local blues combos (including the house band, the '''Jony James Blues Band''') strut their stuff. Bluesy alt-rock acts take the stage from time to time, as well. The Tudor Lounge also has karaoke on Friday nights starting at 11PM."
"The Waiting Room opened in April 2013 under the management of local concert promoter Donny Kutzbach. The bread and butter of this place is lively concerts featuring a wide variety of nationally-known alternative, punk, and indie-rock acts (with a particular emphasis on veteran Canadian alt-rock acts such as Big Wreck, The Lowest of the Low, and Great Big Sea), as well as occasional hip-hop shows, DJ sets, stand-up comedy, burlesque, and other performances."
"Housed in a turn-of-the-century commercial block at the corner of East Huron and Oak Streets, Old Editions Book Shop and Café is one of the largest antiquarian bookstores in the United States. Three full floors of used & rare books, original art and prints, historical documents, collectible magazines and other memorabilia are available to guests of Old Editions for purchase or simply to be browsed through. A small café is available as well. Old Editions Book Shop and Café is a member of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers and of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America."
"The Queen City Gallery is operated by photographer Michael Mulley, whose other space, the '''College Street Gallery''', can be found in Allentown. The gallery's mission, according to its website, is ""Celebrating the Architecture of Buffalo""; accordingly, the Queen City Gallery is filled not only with Mulley's work, but also photography and works in other media by a bevy of local artists, with an accent on vintage and contemporary depictions of Buffalo and Western New York. Books and prints are offered for sale at reasonable prices."
"Located (appropriately enough) in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Corridor within easy walking distance of Buffalo General Hospital, Buffalo Scrubs is Western New York's #1 dealer of high-quality professional medical apparel. Scrubs, lab coats, shoes, and accessories are available in a wide range of styles and brands, with free office consultations, on-site fittings and delivery services provided."
"DC Theatricks is a full-service costume company specializing in custom-made men's period suits and uniforms for sale or rent. Not surprisingly, DC Theatricks does an especially brisk business around Halloween selling literally hundreds of custom-made costumes for adults and children, as well as wigs, makeup, accessories, costume kits, party supplies, decor, and other such goods. DC Theatricks' manufacturing department also takes online orders for shipment anywhere, and wholesale pricing is available to qualified purchasers."
"J. Christian is a brand-new fashion boutique offering up stylish ladies' clothing in an upscale environment in the Theater District's majestic, historic '''Market Arcade''' building. Rather than focusing on one particular area of fashion, owner Jaime Hargrove sells clothes and accessories in a wide variety of styles and for all purposes — and does it well; there's great stuff in here for great prices (customers especially rave over the excellent selection of formalwear and the $5.00 jewelry table). Aside from that, business attire, chic casualwear, and a variety of other accessories including shoes, hats, and handbags are available at J. Christian."
"Newly moved from the Elmwood Village to the beautifully restored Hotel Lafayette, this lovely clothing boutique is the brainchild of Ali Eagen, who springboarded from New York City's Fashion Institute of Technology to a rising star in the design industry in Columbus, Ohio and then back to her hometown of Buffalo. Upscale ladies' clothing is the name of the game at Made by Anatomy, with a stated goal of helping women express their unique sense of identity through fashion. To that end, the showroom features two collections of made-to-measure designs conceived and constructed on-site by Eagen herself, as well as a carefully-selected array of pieces by local designers chosen with a view to an up-to-the-minute fashion style, an impeccable quality of handiwork, an ethos of sustainability and environmental consciousness, and support of the local fashion community. Custom-designed bridalwear is a specialty at Made by Anatomy, with staff on hand to help customers every step of the way in conceiving their own wedding dresses and bridesmaid's gowns from a wide array of fabrics, colors, necklines, sleeve lengths, and other embellishments."
"MMW's owner, Nia Badger, is a Buffalo native who cut her teeth on the retail scene in Brooklyn before coming home in 2012 to open the first iteration of her shop, which was located for a few years in Allentown. Today, the store's interior is dominated by a huge mural photo of Lafayette Square as it looked in Buffalo's early-20th Century glory days: a symbol of the optimism that inspired Badger to take a chance on downtown and resurrect MMW in the '''Brisbane Building'''. In the words of the store's website, MMW's prototype customer is ""a trendy fashionista, wearing her clothing, jewelry and accessories like a celebrity... stays on the best-dressed list; is original, ahead of her time, and is at the tip of everyone's tongue for her style choices"" — and for those stylish urban ladies, a selection of eye-catching clothes, jewelry, and accessories are offered; bold fashion statements for ladies of all shapes and sizes, from 0 to 3X. Best of all are the prices: with all jewelry priced under $100, stylish sunglasses running you about $20, and prices on other items similarly reasonable, a shopping trip to MMW won't break your budget."
"The New Era Cap Company — the exclusive manufacturer and marketer of caps for all Major League Baseball teams and their minor-league affiliates, as well as a licensee of apparel for the NHL, NBA, and over 200 colleges and universities nationwide — has been headquartered in Buffalo since its foundation in 1920. At its flagship store on Delaware Avenue, in the former Federal Reserve Building, shoppers can choose from hats representing just about every professional sports team imaginable. As you can imagine, caps for local teams such as the Sabres and Bisons dominate the selections at the store, as well as the New York Yankees, who also boast a loyal following in Buffalo."
"The first of the four '''Shops at HarborCenter''' to open its doors, in July 2015, at Red Siren owner Sharon Randaccio offers a range of inventory that might best be described as a more carefully curated version of the fare sold at beachside clothing boutiques at the Jersey Shore or other summer resorts, with an accent on the unusual and eye-catching. The offbeat yet stylish summer dresses, one-of-a-kind jewelry, handbags, and accessories, and other options for trendy urban women are miles away from what you'll find at a run-of-the-mill '''Macy's''' or '''JCPenney'''. As well, there's a range of quirky boutique gifts and decorative baubles for around the house."
"Newly relocated in the '''Market Arcade''' after a successful run of several years in the Elmwood Village, SaiOne is run by Angel Rodriguez, a gregarious native New Yorker who is as enthusiastic about giving impromptu tarot card readings as he is about the fashions he offers at his store at fantastic prices. Sold here is a wide variety of one-of-a-kind clothes, jewelry, handbags, and gifts, including many of his own designs (look for the ""OMI Clothing"" label) as well as other locally produced pieces available only in Buffalo. However, what makes SaiOne stand out among its competition is its extensive and fashionable selection of menswear — some customers have even opined that the men's clothing here is better than the women's! Prominent among SaiOne's selection of menswear are stylish t-shirts with bold prints and a refreshing lack of ironic pop-culture references or other '''Urban Outfitters'''-style hipster cutesiness, as well as a range of smart accessories and stylish sunglasses."
"Taking over the reins from its predecessor at Suite 101A of the Ellicott Square Building, '''Destination by Lee Powers''', Sarah Danielle offers affordable ladies' apparel and accessories in a diverse range of styles — the dresses, casual tops, pants and leggings sold here run the gamut from classic looks to the latest trends, attracting a similarly diverse range of customers. The operative word at Sarah Danielle is ""bold"" — bright colors and vibrant patterns rule the day here — but not so bold that you'll never be able to wear these things out and about. A modest range of accessories such as jewelry and handbags, as well as bath and body products, round out the inventory. Best of all, the prices at Sarah Danielle (nothing is over $100!) belie the high quality of the 100% American-made materials and workmanship of these items, and frequent sales and promotions sweeten the deal even more."
"Former Indonesia Stock Exchange trader Novi Paluch has guided Sasmita Batik Indonesia from relatively humble beginnings as a stall at the '''West Side Bazaar''', to a quick ascent into part of the growing wave of retail tenants that have returned to the historic '''Market Arcade''' building (and downtown in general). As can be inferred from the title, the stock in trade of this cute, brightly decorated little shop is an exciting and colorful array of fashions, jewelry and loose batik cloth that ably reflect the beauty and culture of Southeast Asia. As well, Sasmita stocks a modest range of accessories, home decor, kitchenware, and unique gifts of the same ilk."
"Tent City is one of Buffalo's foremost purveyors of activewear, work clothes, and surplus military uniforms. Camping supplies, work boots, winter coats, and apparel from brands like Timberland, Nike, Dickies, Carhartt and Columbia can be found at Tent City's outlet in the heart of the Theater District."
"Trend Up is the project of Giovanni Centurione, a fashionista, photographer, and local booster-turned- downtown retail pioneer who cut his teeth on the runway scene in New York City around the turn of the millennium before returning to his hometown in 2005 to strike out on his own. Contemporary clothing for the modern male of the city is the name of the game here: the overarching aesthetic of the jackets, jeans, and t-shirts you'll find at this at this '''Market Arcade''' boutique is an über-stylish take on urban streetwear for teens to thirtysomethings. The ''raison d'être'' is to provide a local retail outlet for great clothing by hard-to-find designers from arounfd the world, and to that effect Trend Up is today Buffalo's only seller of DOPE, European Apparel, and Other UK branded clothing."
"A brand-new boutique selling a range of vintage and modern clothing, jewelry and accessories in the heart of the Theater District, Yar Mo's Muse specializes in mixing and matching pieces from among their vast inventory of dresses, hats, jewelry, and other accessories to create one-of-a-kind, head-to-toe ensembles that balance timeless elegance with nods to any of a kaleidoscope of head-turning styles. And ""kaleidoscope"" is no exaggeration: Yar Mo's merchandise runs the gamut from brightly-colored dresses in patterns inspired by West African mudcloth, to stylish retro pieces that look like something Audrey Hepburn might have worn, to unusual Victorian-era flourishes such as capes. A respectable range of menswear is also offered."
"Founded in 1892 and run by four generations of its eponymous family, Tiftickjian Oriental Rugs is one of downtown Buffalo's longest-standing businesses, not to mention by far Western New York's largest and best-known dealer in fine Oriental rugs. That uncommon longevity is probably creditable to the second-to-none care taken by the Tiftickjian family of their customers — buying an Oriental rug is a complicated process that requires extensive knowledge of what you're buying, and the staff here is not only knowledgeable but also trustworthy, even to the point of allowing customers to ""live with"" the rugs for a while in their own houses before making a final decision on whether to purchase. As for the merchandise itself, a dizzying variety of rugs and carpets are available, from hand-weaved antiques from Persia to high-quality modern rugs. As well, Tiftickjian offers first-rate cleaning, repair and appraisal services for your rug."
"With Furnishings, retail shopping returns to the former '''L. L. Berger Building''' for the first time since its namesake department store closed in 1991. This is thanks to indefatigable owner Joe Incao, whose three-decade career in upscale retail began right in this building, as a shoe salesman in the waning days of Berger's, before taking him to greener pastures in Manhattan where he served as a senior vice-president at Prada, and then full circle to his hometown right in time for its renaissance. There's a wide gamut of merchandise on offer at this cute little boutique, much more than just the furniture that gives the place its name (small-scale items such as chairs and lamps, mostly) — you also have stylish home decorative goods, men's and ladies' fashion accessories (check out their great selection of unique ties!), and a wide selection of Buffalo-themed souvenirs and gifts, all united by a common thread of eye-catching, vintage- and Midcentury Modern-inspired designs with a witty sense of humor. Though the items sold here are high-quality and prices on the more expensive ones can run into the four-figure range, there are also plenty of comparatively inexpensive gifts to attract casual souvenir shoppers."
"Scherer Furniture is Buffalo's oldest furniture store, operating since 1897 in the same handsome four-story brick block at the corner of Genesee and Oak Streets, across the road from the lovingly restored '''Genesee Gateway''' row. Even as similar businesses fled for the suburbs, the loyal customers of Scherer Furniture have continued to travel here from all over the region to purchase the quality products sold in this showroom. Those products include solid oak, cherry and hardwood furnishings for every room in the house from renowned manufacturers such as Statton, Wesley Hall, Lexington, Colonial, and Hallagan, sold at reasonable prices with delivery and setup included. Free parking is provided."
"Diamond Cutters of Western New York began in 1984 as a small brokerage serving downtown Buffalo, and has since grown into one of Western New York's largest and best-regarded purveyors of wholesale diamonds, selling its products nationwide. ""To go to a more direct source, you'll need a miner's hat"", so the slogan says, and indeed, Diamond Cutters of Western New York are able to offer customers unthinkable deals on diamond jewelry by cutting out the middleman, traveling the world to carefully hand-select loose diamonds, which are cut and polished by the two award-winning gemologists on staff, mounted into a selection of lovely contemporary rings, earrings, pendants and other pieces by Diamond Cutters' own goldsmith (a selection of other lines of jewelry designs, including Cordova, Prima New York, and Vanna K are also available), and sold directly to the customer. The friendly and talented staff can even help you custom-design your own jewelry! To top it all off, Diamond Cutters of Western New York offers a 30-day exchange policy on all jewelry, lifetime diamond upgrades and cleaning and polishing, and free appraisal."
"Melting Point Jewelers is the place where owner Diane Von Heckler handcrafts personalized custom-designed gold and platinum jewelry for a growing legion of loyal customers — designs which usually include the diamonds and other precious and semiprecious gemstones that Melting Point sells. Melting Point will also appraise, repair or restore your old jewelry or watch, or remount gems from your old piece into a completely new setting."
"Located in the '''Brisbane Building''' on newly revitalized Lafayette Square, New Generations is a friendly neighborhood shop that does it all — not only do they sell a wide range of rings, earrings, bracelets, charms, timepieces and other jewelry items in gold and sterling silver, but the store provides complimentary gift wrapping and engraving, and will adjust and replace watchbands and change watch batteries while you wait. The friendly and knowledgeable service at New Generations is matched by amazing prices — customers speak again and again of spending less than half what they would at other stores for items that are of respectable quality."
"Winner of multiple awards in ''Buffalo Spree'' magazine's annual ""Best of Western New York"" feature, City Wine Merchant was described in that publication as having ""one of the most discriminating and thoughtful wine selections Western New York has ever seen"". City Wine Merchant prides itself on tasting and carefully selecting every vintage offered for sale in their store, with a goal of offering a broad selection of high-quality wines from around the world that strikes a balance between quality and value. These prominently include lesser-known vintages from small wineries in the local area and unusual or little-known wine regions. City Wine Merchant also boasts a small but growing selection of old and rare wines sourced from private cellars."
"With the Niagara Distilling Company, Nick Kotrides, once best known as the former owner of Hertel Avenue's '''Empire Grill''' and Elmwood's '''Toro Tapas Bar''' and '''Faherty's''', along with partner Eric Heuser, who brings to the table ten years of experience at a distillery in Germany, manufactures and bottles a range of organic farm-to-bottle craft spirits sourced exclusively from New York State suppliers. Niagara Distilling currently churns out 2,000 bottles a day of vodka and gin sold under the '''1812''' brand name — with plans to inaugurate a line of moonshine, bourbon and rye in the near future — in a former carriage house and stable whose historically-sensitive restoration was inspired by the revived Distillery District in nearby Toronto. Set back a good distance off Ellicott Street, you pass through a lovely outdoor courtyard with patio seating — a sort of ""beer garden"" for cocktail aficionados — to get to the spacious tasting room/retail outlet in the front of the building. Tours are also offered on request, and seminars are offered for those who'd like to try their hand at home distilling."
"The second and perhaps more fortuitously-located branch of Buffalo Adore — South Buffalo's favorite outlet of one-of-a-kind Buffalo-themed gifts run by the husband-and-wife team of Andrea and Eric Dacey — opened up shop in the '''Market Arcade''' in September 2015. Here you'll find essentially the same merchandise as at the original Abbott Road store — the usual clothes and coffee mugs augmented by posters, embroidered wall hangings, decorative throw pillows, and other tchotchkes that are the work of locally-based artisans — but in a much more convenient and centralized location in the heart of the downtown Buffalo action."
"The August 2015 opening of the second location of Clayton's Toyland marks a return to the city for a dearly-beloved local institution that left the Elmwood Village for suburbia years ago. At '''HarborCenter''' there's not as much floor space to work with as at the main location in Williamsville, so instead of a massive emporium of every kind of toy, game, and stuffed animal imaginable, here you have a carefully curated selection of products specifically selected with Canalside visitors in mind. Naturally, that means a lot of outdoor toys — get your kites, Frisbees, stomp rockets, and paddleball sets at Clayton's — as well as a cuddly stuffed buffalo free with every purchase of $40 or more. As at the Williamsville store, name brands, Disney and other corporate tie-ins, and video games and other electronics are eschewed in favor of a decidedly old-fashioned selection of quirky, high-quality toys that feed children's imagination."
"Described succinctly and accurately by one reviewer as ""the only decent store left inside the '''Main Place Mall'''"", there's scarcely a better place to go than the Gift Loft if you're in the mood for the kind of souvenir or tchotchke that could only have come from Buffalo. The main stock in trade here are locally-designed, locally-printed and locally-themed t-shirts, glassware and other gifts that pay homage to all the facets of the Queen City's identity. From points of Buffalo pride like chicken wings and fabulous architecture, to dearly departed landmarks like the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', to local politicians and celebrities like Jimmy Griffin and Irv Weinstein, to Buffalo's vibrant Irish, Polish, Italian, German, and other ethnic communities — if there's something you noticed as unique during your trip to Buffalo, there's probably a gift here for you to commemorate it. (Yes, that even includes the smell of Cheerios that fills downtown courtesy of the '''General Mills''' factory.) The inventory also includes art and literature by local artists, posters and postcards, handmade jewelry, and an ever-changing range of miscellaneous kitschy baubles. Best of all, the staff — helmed by owner Edwin Jablonski — are supremely friendly, helpful, and will answer any question you have about their products or Buffalo in general."
"The second location of the upscale boutique of the same name that has made such a splash on Hertel Avenue has been in business at the Hotel Lafayette since 2012. In contrast to the focus of the original '''room''' on luxury furniture and housewares, room2 places more of an emphasis on quality gifts, many of which are locally-themed: quirky items such as buffalo-shaped bottle openers and throw pillows with the geographical coordinates of the city printed on them are a great way for visitors to downtown to commemorate their visit to Buffalo. A modest array of accessories such as scarves and jewelry are also on offer, and the typical stock in trade of the Hertel Avenue location is not neglected either: interestingly, many of the same upscale furnishings found in the Hotel Lafayette's guest rooms upstairs are available for sale at room2. As with the original room, the items at room2 are high-end and priced accordingly — the aforementioned throw pillows sell for upwards of $100 — so do not expect any bargains here."
"After six years of selling online the hand-poured soy candles she still produces at her home in Alden, runaway demand finally got the best of Sharon Snell, and she made the leap in late 2014 to a brick-and-mortar storefront on the ground floor of the '''City Centre Building''' in the Theater District. Still today, the pleasant interior of ScentCerely Yours!, all light-colored wood with rustic folk-art touches, brings a bit of the downhome charm of countrified Alden to the downtown core — and it's a feast for the nose as well as the eyes; customers are encouraged to sniff-test the candles for themselves, and there are even coffee tins provided on each shelf as a sort of olfactory palette cleanser. Snell takes pride in formulating each of these scents herself, and there are some really creative and unique options to be had here — ""Forget-Me-Not Linen"", ""Watermelon Lime Splash"", and the musky, manly ""His Place"" are some of the more interesting ones — all boasting aromas that are subtly pleasant without overpowering you with their odor. Snell individually tests each candle before sale, and perhaps most importantly of all, unlike many eco-friendly candle manufacturers all of ScentCerely Yours' products are made of 100% soybean wax, with no paraffin or other dirty-burning additives. A range of decorative candle holders and other related accessories are also on offer."
"""Swarovski with a Buffalo twist"", in the words of one visitor: at Abino Mills the name of the game is one-of-a-kind, customized etched glass, courtesy of mother-and-son owner team Connie and Ted Constantine. From her former career as a photo restorer, Connie has brought to bear dedication, patience, and an unwavering eye for detail to this new venture which began in the family basement before growing into a storefront in suburban Williamsville in 2012, and from there to its current location four years later — with end results that are a cut above what you'll find elsewhere. The interior of Abino Mills is perfect for browsing — the hardwood floors, dark-toned walls, and warm lighting (brought to you by Buffalo's own '''Litelab''', best-known for designing the light-up dance floor in the movie ''Saturday Night Fever'') really draw shoppers' eyes to the merchandise on the shelves. Speaking of, the selection here consists of a wide variety of bowls, vases, wine glasses, decanters, and the like, crafted in the finest Riedel and Darlington crystalware whose etchings often reflect a Buffalo theme — the kind of upscale, intimate shopping experience that brings to mind the Delaware Avenue of old. If none of that is to your liking, you can work with Abino Mills' staff to create your very own designs."
"If the name of this place brings to mind a bakery for dogs, that's entirely intentional: the Buffalo Barkery opened its doors in downtown's '''Market Arcade''' in April 2016, the brainchild of a pair of dog-loving sisters-in-law who'd been searching for an alternative to mass-produced, overprocessed pet foods before taking matters into their own hands, offering a line of all-natural, homemade dog biscuits and treats made with all human-grade ingredients (and without preservatives, by-products, or unnecessary fillers). The ""Buffalo"" half of the moniker is done justice as well — specialty biscuit flavors include beef on weck and Buffalo chicken wing, and they also sell a yummy pumpkin treat in the shape of Canalside's own '''Shark Girl'''. Beyond the realm of the edible, Buffalo Barkery also offers a carefully curated range of high-quality squeak toys, shampoos and grooming supplies, and collars and leashes, all manufactured in the United States. Cat fanciers aren't left in the cold, either: a range of collars, catnip mice, and the like are sold as well."
"Fowler's was one of the quartet of businesses that opened in the brand-new '''Shops at HarborCenter''' in summer 2015, but really it's just the latest iteration of a Buffalo tradition of over a century running. Here sweet-toothed visitors to Canalside can pick up what's considered by wide local consensus to be the best sponge candy in Buffalo, along with a range of other locally-manufactured chocolaty treats and ice cream from Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''."
"In business in the Theater District since 1972, owner Lou Montesano has built Lincoln Coin & Stamp's renown with collectors from all over the city and region with his honesty, integrity, and friendly and helpful service to his customers. A wide and changing selection of coins and stamps of all descriptions are available, as are supplies and accessories for the collector. Appraisal service is also available. Despite Lincoln Coin & Stamp's downtown location, ample free parking is available!"
"M. Steffan's Sons was founded in 1851, and is the oldest continually-operated leather goods store in the United States. Once a powerhouse in the industry, furnishing supplies from its own tannery to the majority of America's shoemakers and harnessmakers as well as selling its own shoes under the '''Winchester''' brand name, Steffan's today is a smaller business, occupying an unassuming storefront at the north end of the Theater District. There, a huge variety of merchandise is available — buckles, rings, rivets and snaps, leather shoelaces, leatherworking supplies such as needles, shears and thread, and a myriad of other items — all curated by Linda Steffan, scion of the same family that's owned the business for over a century and a half, and her trusty dog Milo. Friendly and helpful customer service is king here — Steffan really goes out of her way to educate local crafters about the art of shoemaking and leathercraft, going so far as to offer workshops every Monday morning where enthusiasts can learn from experts in the field in a hands-on manner. Steffan's will also gladly repair your leather shoes, handbags and other accessories, and phone and fax orders can be shipped nationwide."
"Bada Bing was one of the last holdouts at the former '''Delaware Court Building''', which was demolished at the end of 2013 to make way for a new high-rise — but now it's back in a new location at the other end of Chippewa Street. Much more than just another rowdy Chip Strip nightspot, head chef Dominic Paladino has set to work transforming the place into an authentic Italian restaurant where guests are treated like family. An ''Artvoice'' feature story described Bada Bing's fare as ""pub grub with an Italian twist"" and gave a succinct description of the ""sangwiches"" served there — garlic bread and grated cheese concoctions that are Paladino's own creation. Pasta, chicken and sausage parmigiana, chicken wings and fingers, and salads are also available."
"For a light lunch or dinner in a setting unlike any other, the place to be at Canalside is The Blue Line. An outdoor café situated on a pedestrian bridge above the reconstructed Erie Canal — right above the site where the Buffalo Sabres used to face off against their opponents at the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', hence the name — the Blue Line's menu is a combination of the best of two separate Buffalo restaurants. '''Code Blu Juice Bar''', formerly of Allen Street, sets up shop at lunchtime seven days a week with a menu of healthy smoothies and juice blends, as well as a modest range of light salads such as lentil, wheatberry, and curried chicken. Then, four days a week at dinnertime, '''Just Fries''' (whose brick-and-mortar location can be found on Genesee Street) serves up its eponymous food in a myriad of different gourmet permutations — appetizer-sized potions topped with a variety of sauces and aiolis (including numerous vegan options); main-course ""loaded fry"" platters topped with ground hamburger and cheese, souvlaki meat, and more; desserts of sweet potato fries topped with marshmallow sauce, Nutella, brown sugar and butter, and more."
"After 62 years on Elmwood Avenue, Casa-di-Pizza moved downtown in 2015, making its mark on the revitalization of Buffalo's business district in its new home just off the burgeoning 500 Block of Main Street. Though the location has changed, the menu is much the same as before: at heart Casa-di-Pizza remains an old-school neighborhood pizzeria, Italian restaurant, and bar, whose food — chicken wings and fingers, subs, salads, sandwiches and burgers, pasta dishes, simple yet hearty homestyle entrees such as barbecue chicken and ribs, and, of course, pizza — is as delicious as it is unpretentious. One new addition to the menu are the ""breakfast pizzas"" served up to hungry downtown office workers on weekday mornings."
"When it opened in 2011 it was little more than Canalside's answer to '''The Hatch''' at Erie Basin Marina, with a pleasant and summery but fairly unimaginative menu of hot dogs, burgers, and ice cream. But lately owner Kate Elliott has revamped The Dish with a more upscale focus: to the pleasant surprise of diners, interesting new additions such as a tofu ''banh mi'' and curried lentil fritters have appeared on the menu, and old favorites were given innovative new twists, such as a burger made with a blend of short rib and sirloin sourced from '''Pat LaFreida Meats'''. Breakfast time sees a variety of egg sandwiches served up for early birds. As always, ''al fresco'' dining is the rule at The Dish: long communal tables line the boardwalk along the side of the river, with refreshing lake breezes caressing you and the plaintive wail of seagulls serenading you as you eat."
"The aptly named E-Café is more than just another lunch-break destination for the suit-and-tie crowd — it's a veritable Internet café, rare in these parts, with free WiFi and a collection of wired PC terminals available free to customers. In this spacious restaurant, which boasts high ceilings and walls painted in bold yet pleasant autumnal tones of yellow and orange, you can get simple but well-prepared lunches and breakfasts served with a smile and lightning speed. The usual range of subs, wraps, burgers, soups, and salads are all on offer and all delicious, but E-Café's customers reserve special praise for the dozen or so melt and focaccia sandwiches on offer at lunchtime, from hot ham and roast beef to turkey reuben on rye to tuna on sourdough. Breakfast sees office workers savoring the scent of bacon in the air as they gobble up omelettes and breakfast sandwiches (available on English muffins or bagels) before the workday begins. The downside is the coffee, which is just okay. On Fridays they close early, but make up for it with free fountain beverages all day."
"Emerson Commons is a food court that's staffed by high school students and faculty from the Buffalo Public Schools' '''Emerson School of Hospitality''' and open on school days. Appropriately enough, the fairly pedestrian cuisine here can be likened to school cafeteria fare kicked up a few notches in quality — the upside, however, is that this is among the most affordable food you can get in the downtown core. Lunchtime offerings change daily; the menu usually contains two soups, two hot sandwiches, and three heartier main courses. The current week's menus are posted at the website for those who want to make their mind up in advance. Pizza by the slice, a salad bar, and an assortment of homemade desserts are available every day. Breakfast is also served."
"The founding credo of the Pan-American Exposition, held in Buffalo in 1901, was all about ""bringing closer together the peoples of this hemisphere in their social, political, and commercial relations"", and it's that collective community spirit that inspired the name of EXPO Market, opened in 2016 in the former home of '''Perfetto''' restaurant by a partnership of local real estate developer Nick Sinatra and restaurateur Paul Tsouflidis, owner of Elmwood Avenue's '''Acropolis''', '''Newbury Street Café''', and '''Crush Juicery''' (the latter two of which have satellite locations here). EXPO has been described variously as a ""food court"" for the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''' and as downtown's fancier, less culinarily daring answer to the '''West Side Bazaar''', but perhaps a better comparison would be to an upscale take on a university dining hall — compete with colorful contemporary decor on the walls, ''loud'' piped-in music (mostly upbeat, singalong-able '90s and early '00s alt-rock hits), and an overall surprisingly youthful feel to the place. The dimly lit interior of this cavernous space accentuates stylish decorative accents like the exposed brick of the wall and the track lighting and exposed ductwork on the ceiling, while also calling attention to the brightly lit LED screens and lighting elements that make up an important component of the decor. EXPO is home to five food counters, most of which are satellite locations of brick-and-mortar restaurants elsewhere in Buffalo, and all of which offer quick service to the downtown lunch crowd. There's also '''GBGB''' — Gypsy Bohemian Grove Bar — where a team headed jointly by the folks behind the West Side's '''Gypsy Parlor''' and Allentown's '''Duke's Bohemian Grove''' pour a range of craft brews as well as some of Gypsy Parlor's signature cocktails — and, in the morning, locally brewed '''Public Coffee'''."
"Run by a partnership helmed by Charlie Goldman of '''Allen Street Hardware Café''' fame, Bobby Alfman's can be compared to a gourmet (and gourmet-priced) version of '''Subway''' sandwich shop. On the menu are your choice of seven deli sandwiches served on same-day-baked 12-inch hoagie rolls — the Number 4 (pastrami and corned beef with Swiss cheese and onion) packs a nice kick courtesy of the spicy mustard it comes slathered in, while the Number 1 (Italian beef with stewed tomatoes and provolone) is pretty underwhelming. Potato chips, fountain drinks, and a soup of the day are available as sides, but on an ''à la carte'' basis only — sadly, there's no ""Fresh Value Meal"" equivalent in the Subway analogy."
"Unlike many EXPO Market vendors, the menu at the satellite location of Crush Juicery is comparable in range to its original location: all thirteen of the smoothies and all four of the granola fruit bowls that are available at their little counter within '''Newbury Street Café''' on Elmwood can also be enjoyed at their stand-alone booth downtown, and although the original's cold-pressed juices and herbal teas are missing, that's made up for by an enticing menu of $5 breakfasts that are available all day: oatmeal bowls with your choice of fruit topping, yummy Greek yogurt parfaits, and spicy, savory avocado toast topped with crumbled goat cheese. As at its counterpart, though, the smoothies are the biggest draw at Crush Juicery — standouts include the ""Ventura Boulevard"" (with kale, banana, raw cashew, agave nectar, and almond milk) and the ""Oxford Street"" (avocado, kale, pineapple, banana, coconut water, and spirulina) — all clean, green, healthy, and packed with energy and nutrients. If you want an extra bit of oomph, you can even order your smoothie ""enhanced"" with boosters such as whey protein, turmeric, bee pollen, and creatine."
"'''Osteria 166''''s EXPO Market outlet offers an abbreviated but respectably diverse selection of a half-dozen signature pasta dishes that run the gamut from familiar but well-executed favorites like spaghetti and meatballs, to more interesting creations such as tortellini alfredo with peas, as well as changing daily specials. However, the most recommendable thing on the menu at Mercato is almost inarguably the $10 build-your-own pasta option that enables many combinations that are more creative than the menu standards. You get your choice of one pasta, one sauce, one meat (perennials like grilled chicken and Italian sausage but also pancetta and Italian pulled pork), and an unlimited number of the two dozen or so vegetable toppings Mercato offers (unique standouts here include escarole, pine nuts, and wild mushrooms). Throw in a side of risotto sticks or parmesan truffle chips, add a San Pellegrino soda to drink, and you're good to go."
"Another Paul Tsouflidis-owned Elmwood Avenue health-food purveyor with a presence at EXPO Market, at Newbury Street you can choose from a curated selection of their well-beloved wraps and burritos, the ever-popular spicy quinoa bowl with chicken, as well as the full range of signature salads that you can get at the original — yes, this includes the Brainy Beet and the Jalapeño Chicken. However, most visitors to Newbury Street opt for the build-your-own salad — you choose a leafy green as a base, any of four additional vegetable ingredients, premium toppings if you like, and dressing — and build-your-own quinoa bowls and wraps work under similar principles. The locally-baked multigrain bread offered for a paltry 35-cent upcharge, sourced from the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''', tops it all off (figuratively, and literally too if you like)."
"The EXPO iteration of the West Side's ever-popular '''Sun Restaurant''' focuses not on tasty Burmese specialties but on sushi, many varieties of which incorporate chef/owner Kevin Lin's signature ingredient, black rice. Aficionados of the original location will be pleased to know that the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') is indeed included in the selection of side salads, and if you're not in the mood for sushi, you can also avail yourself of black rice pudding, steamed chicken or vegetable dumplings, or refreshing Thai iced tea or coffee to drink."
"Best known as the locally-owned specialty food shop that has inspired such a rabidly loyal fanbase in the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo, the Globe Market also operates a small gourmet cafeteria in the '''Cathedral Park Tower''' that's regularly filled with corporate power lunchers from the nearby office buildings. Those who've experienced the Elmwood or Hertel locations will feel at home immediately among the large selection of gourmet specialty salads, sandwiches and wraps on the menu, not to mention the thing that's really put the Globe Market on the map: their daily selection of delicious soups made from scratch."
"Pretty much the only lifeline keeping the '''Main Place Mall''' alive is its food court (see infobox above), which at lunchtime on weekdays is filled with workers from the attached high-rise office tower. Indeed, if you're downtown on a weekday and you're in the mood for an inexpensive bite, it can be worthwhile to make your way through the corridors past the empty storefronts and enjoy pizza at '''Zesto's''' or '''Gino and Joe's''', deli sandwiches at '''Hoagie Brothers''' or '''H. B. Carver''', Mexican food at '''Tijuana Taco''' or Chinese at '''Ding How Express'''. On weekends it's a dicier proposition; though the mall is open seven days a week, many of the restaurants are closed and the ghost-town ambience can be downright eerie."
"The Hatch is the snack bar at the '''Erie Basin Marina''', serving tasty burgers, hot dogs, fries, and a wide selection of ice cream and other frozen treats. The real appeal of The Hatch, though, are the lovely lake breezes and the stunning waterfront views that grace its visitors on hot summer days. This is why the Erie Basin Marina is popular not only with boaters but also with joggers, sunbathers, and people-watchers. Convenient to the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Military Park and all downtown attractions. Watch out for seagulls!"
"Downtown Buffalo's staple street food, and probably the most affordable lunch you'll find there, is served by the open-air hot dog carts that work the busy street corners of the business district. Unmissable with their big, bright red and yellow umbrellas, the most popular selection here is, of course, hot dogs (invariably '''Wardynski's''', for some reason), which go for around $2. Also available for a bit more money are jumbo all-beef franks, Polish and Italian sausage dogs, and, in some cases, burgers. Most carts also offer a value pack of two hot dogs and a drink, which usually run about $4.50. The friendly vendors cook your food before your eyes on portable outdoor grills, slather on the condiments of your choice, and customers can fish soft drinks out of Styrofoam coolers on the sidewalk nearby. On weekdays from roughly 9AM-4:30PM you'll find a dozen or more hot dog carts up and down the Main Street pedestrian mall (especially in '''Lafayette Square''' and around '''Cathedral Park'''), as well as other spots with heavy foot traffic, such as '''Niagara Square''' and '''Canalside'''. Some operate on weekends too, but they're much fewer and further between outside of business hours."
"Located in the splendiferous lobby of the '''Ellicott Square Building''', this corporate power-lunching hotspot is operated by Joseph's Catering Service. As its name implies, Joseph's Panini Stand's specialty is a huge selection of delicious made-to-order panini and wraps. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose, according to conventional wisdom, but for something especially unique try the apple tuna panini or the onion teriyaki burger wrap. Add to this a wide variety of salads (small side salads, specialty main-course salads and a full salad bar), delicious homemade soups that are the highlight of the menu according to local consensus, and smoothies and smoothie shooters made with real fruit, and you have one of the business district's favorite spots for light, healthy and inexpensive lunches on the go. Vegetarians, vegans and the gluten-free crowd are well taken care of too, and not just with salads."
"Ask local foodies what was the most anticipated restaurant opening in recent memory on the 500 Block of Main Street, and they'll invariably say '''Raclette's'''. But a solid second place has to be Don Warfe's lunchtime spot just a few doors down, which opened its doors in June 2016 at the end of a 19-month-long, stem-to-stern restoration of the historic '''Genesee Block''', the oldest building on the 500 Block (''c.'' 1845). The first rule of thumb for Just Fries is not to let yourself be put off by the lines that routinely stretch out the door — service is lightning-fast, and the food is worth it. That being said, for best results you should not bother holding out for a table in the postage stamp-sized dining room: if it's a nice day you can enjoy a nice ''al fresco'' lunch at one of the tables on '''Roosevelt Plaza''', or else take your order to go. As for the menu, the inevitable comparison is with Buffalo's other ""French fries as main course"" eatery, the ever-popular '''Allen Street Poutine Company''', and there are indeed some similarities — real, honest-to-goodness poutine is one of the biggest sellers here, available in both the classic fries-gravy-cheese curd setup and ""Buffalo style"" with blue cheese and hot sauce. But for the most part, the loaded-fry platters that make up the real backbone of the menu are distinct entities: the low prices they charge belie the size of the portions and the high quality of the ingredients. Standouts include the souvlaki fries (topped with marinated beef, feta, and ''tzatziki'' sauce), the ''pizza fritta'' (melted mozzarella, marinara sauce, and pepperoni), and the cheeseburger fries (ground Angus beef, cheddar, ketchup, and pickles). Surprisingly enough, the place's major weak spot are the fries themselves: Warfe makes much of the imported German ""air fryer"" he's purchased to cook up healthier fries with 40% less fat and 30% less calories, but consensus says a bit of the flavor is lost with that method. To drink you have a selection of locally-bottled '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas or — in a nod to '''Jerk's''', the old-school malt shop and soda fountain Warfe owns a block down Main Street — homemade milkshakes."
"Mark Marotto may be better-known these days as the chef, owner and namesake of '''Marotto's Restaurant''' in Kenmore. However, the original restaurant where he and his two brothers cut their teeth is still alive and kicking in downtown Buffalo, a block from Niagara Square. Founded in 1958 by Mark's father Jerry Marotto and continuously owned by the family since then, Marotto's DuBois complements the elegant upscale Italian fare available at the Kenmore location with a smaller but equally delicious slate of breakfast and lunch options perfect for on-the-go downtown office workers. Burgers and fries, club sandwiches (featuring turkey roasted and hand-carved in house), and similar items are available, as well as pasta dishes and other somewhat more elaborate fare. DuBois wears its old-school identity on its sleeve — the serving staff here is decked out in ""waitress whites"", and the place has the feel of a private club — and it's the perfect setting to bear witness to judges and officials from the nearby courthouse talking shop over lunch at ""The Roundtable"", or local hotshot attorneys relaxing at the cocktail bar which stays open long after the kitchen closes."
"After having done a brisk business for over twenty years at the original Natalie's in Amherst, Tony Mansour brought his trademark slate of quick, light, all-homemade Greek and Lebanese specialties to a second location at the '''Genesee Gateway''' in late 2015. At Natalie's, downtown power lunchers have their choice of copious Mediterranean favorites such as shawarma, souvlaki, and gyro that can be ordered either as wraps or full-size platters; fresh, flavorful ''fatoush'' and ''tabbouleh'' salads, ''hummus'' and ''baba ghanoush'' appetizers, and — in the morning — a killer range of breakfast sandwiches. The vegan and vegetarian crowd will be particularly delighted with the wide selection of veggie-, falafel- and hummus-based wraps. Natalie's delivers, too."
"Serving the best pizza in downtown Buffalo, Prima Pizza & Pasta is situated at the east end of the Chippewa Strip and is a popular place to grab a bite to eat after a night of clubbing. In addition to the astounding variety of pizza, subs, wings, pasta, salads, and tacos are served."
"Opened in January 2015 by Jason Davidson, best known as the proprietor of the nearby waterfront seafood eatery '''Liberty Hound''', Roux Soup Bar occupies the space on the fifth floor of the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}} that was once its cafeteria; as you can imagine, this place is still most popular with ''News'' staffers, but it's open to the general public too (sign in at the security desk in the lobby), and it's a great place to grab an affordable lunch or light dinner downtown. With a wide variety of po' boys on the menu as well as a delicious seafood gumbo — not to mention its name — it's safe to say that the cuisine here skews Cajun and Creole, an idea that was born of Davidson's nostalgia for his former home of New Orleans. But Roux is no one-trick pony: the menu includes local favorites like beef on weck, familiar Greek diner fare like chicken souvlaki served on a pita, and even the po' boy template is used for sandwich fillings that have little to do with Creole cuisine, like chicken Milanese. Most diverse of all are the homemade soups, four apiece that change daily and draw from chef Jamie Zynda's encyclopedic repertoire of delicious recipes. Breakfasts are among the heartiest downtown has to offer, and there's a gargantuan self-serve salad bar. As for ambience, Roux mixes corporate sterility with a few delightfully unique touches: for a taste of local history, there's a glass display case at the front entrance where every day they hang the front cover of the 100-years-old-to-the-day issue of the ''News'', and the dining room boasts unsurpassed views over both Canalside and the ''News'' building's fourth-floor atrium, ringed with a giant trough where tropical plants grow year-round."
"Open weekdays for breakfast and lunch, this perennial favorite with the downtown office crowd serves simple but tasty Greek diner fare for reasonable prices. The interior is spartan and dated (try to snag one of the unfortunately limited number of outdoor tables if weather permits), but customers rave about Taki's fried-to-perfection French fries, homemade Greek dressing, and light and healthy souvlaki."
"Easily Buffalo's most famous restaurant, and one of the few places in town that could justifiably be called a ""tourist trap"". Whether the Anchor Bar is recommendable to you largely depends on why you've come. If you're a hardcore chicken wing fan who wants to make a pilgrimage to the place where they all began, and maybe pick up some chicken wing-themed T-shirts and other merchandise while you're at it, you'll likely leave happy: this is indeed the place where, in 1964, chef Teressa Bellissimo fried up a platter of wings that she was about to throw away and served them, doused in spicy sauce, to a group of her son's friends who arrived at closing time. But if you care more about a quality dining experience than paying homage to chicken wing history, look elsewhere: service is generic, utterly indifferent, and seems designed to get you in and out as fast as possible, and the food quality and price point are pretty much what you'd expect from a place where the majority of patrons are out-of-towners rather than potential repeat guests. Offerings include wings in various sauces such as barbeque, mild, medium, hot, or ""suicidal"", and also a variety of salads, sandwiches (including that other standout of Buffalo cuisine, beef on weck), and simple but hearty Italian fare."
"Bambino Bar and Kitchen is a new restaurant downtown that has earned rave reviews for its casual, simple, and old-fashioned — yet upscale — Italian cuisine served up in an airy, inviting ambience in the Theater District. Wood-fired pizzas are a specialty, with the pizza oven open till midnight M-Th and 2AM F-Sa. By way of appetizers, the mozzarella bar — featuring balls of homemade, hand-stretched mozzarella cheese served with a choice of garnishes that includes Sicilian and Greek olive tapenade, prosciutto di Parma, and Caprese salad — is the most interesting choice. Completing the picture is the modest but delectable range of pastas, soups, salads and heartier entrees, the latter characterized by delicious pork and chicken cutlets of the type that made chef/owner Noel Morreale's previous restaurant, '''Fiamma Steak''' on Hertel Avenue, locally renowned. Some of Buffalo's best cocktails are served at the bar, catering and private party space are available, and live music performances happen periodically."
"One of the Theater District's finest dining establishments, the Bijou Grille specializes in upscale Continental and Italian cuisine in a prime setting just across the street from the historic and beautiful Shea's Buffalo Theatre. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads are also available, and the second floor features two elegant and spacious banquet rooms."
"In the heart of the Theater District, Cabaret is a popular place to enjoy high-quality upscale cuisine before or after shows and musicals. A wide variety of delicious salads, sandwiches, and entrees are on offer, with Continental and Italian selections predominating. A banquet room is also offered."
"Conveniently located across the street from the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Buffalo, the Century Grill serves fine food in the majestic ambience of the historic former '''Ancient Landmarks Masonic Lodge'''. Entrees such as steaks and chops, roasted chicken, and pasta dishes are complemented by sandwiches, salads, and an extensive and creative array of appetizers. Local specialties such as fish fry and beef on weck are also served."
"Situated on the ground-floor storefront of the '''Colonial Apartments''' on the northern fringe of downtown, this popular lunch spot is a family-run operation, which cuts both ways: their website is not lying when it touts their ""generous sandwich[es] with the freshest bread and finest ingredients"", but it's hard to fire your own flesh and blood, which makes for less-than-stellar service. If you luck out, you might end up with a waitress that's friendly and efficient, but more often the service at Chris' is slow, indifferent, and downright surly. (Luckily, take-out and delivery are available.) Still, this place packs 'em in during their brief lunchtime opening hours, seemingly on the deliciousness of their food alone. The sandwiches served here are creative concoctions that are sure to be delicious no matter what you order, on your choice of ten different breads and with a variety of optional toppings. A particular favorite is the smoked turkey salad sandwich blended with fresh dill for an incomparable flavor. All sandwiches come with chips by default, but try a side of sweet potato fries for a $3 upcharge. Grilled fare such as burgers and steak sandwiches are offered (if you're a fan of turkey burgers, Chris' has an unusual abundance of varieties), specialty salads include a variation on caprese salad with lemon basil vinaigrette in place of balsamic, and fish fries are served on Friday. Prices at Chris' are high, but — if you're willing to put up with the aforementioned lousy service — you really do get what you pay for."
"In August 2015, the revitalized 500 Block of Main Street landed the eighth and newest location of locally renowned olive oil and vinegar purveyor '''D'Avolio''', and the second to feature an attached restaurant. D'Avolio's Kitchen sates the appetites of the downtown lunch crowd with a menu of ""build your own"" salads, pizzas, antipasto plates, and sandwiches (the latter come with a side salad or cup of soup) for $11.95 apiece. When you enter, you're shown to your table and given a laminate-surfaced blackboard menu and a dry-erase marker; just mark off your selection of ingredients (choose a bread/crust/base of some sort, one or two meats, one or two cheeses, veggie toppings, and condiments) and hand it to your server. There's not much in the way of side dishes or other items on the menu, but a soup du jour and seasonal fruit bowl are offered, as is a wide range of hot and iced teas and other nonalcoholic drinks, plus a somewhat more modest selection of beer and wine. The food is prepared simply but beautifully with time-tested Old World techniques that really bring out the subtle flavors of the ingredients, and portions are large. Best of all, before or after your meal, you can browse the sales racks filled with the same selection of gourmet olive oils and vinegars as at D'Avolio's retail locations."
"November 2015 saw the debut of yet another entry in the roster of the emerging ""restaurant row"" on Ellicott Street: Deep South Taco is an upscale taquería situated in a former storage warehouse just off Lafayette Square. Paying tribute to his roots in the Southern U.S. with the name of the place, owner Richard Hamilton is an Oklahoma native and veteran restaurateur whose inspiration for Deep South Taco was the authentic, downhome Mexican cooking he dabbled in as a sort of antidote to the hoity-toity fine dining of the places he owned over the years. Far from the sleepy cantina you may be picturing, though, a meal at Deep South Taco is a real experience: as you walk up to the place you see a giant rotating ''lucha libre'' mask on the front wall of the building facing Ellicott Street, framed by psychedelic lights and visuals courtesy of an outdoor video projector; indoors you're bathed in garish blue, purple and red LED lights punctuated by the eerie greenish glow of illuminated heating ducts and bar taps. (If that sounds like too much sensory overload for you, there's also the more subdued environment of the heated rooftop patio, open all year, as well as the outdoor street-level patio perfect for warm summer days.) Deep South's menu is small but packs a punch, dominated by a range of different tacos that you order singly — at $4-5 apiece, you can mix and match a combination of several; favorites include the ''taco de pescado'' (with crispy or grilled tilapia and chipotle mayo) and the ''taco de carnitas'' (spicy pulled pork and guajillo serrano salsa). Tacos are served on homemade tortillas that draw mixed reviews: fresh as can be, but fluffier than you may be used to and sometimes prone to falling apart in your hand. Elsewhere on the menu, there's a meal-in-itself nacho platter smothered in melted ''cortija'' cheese for that extra touch of authenticity, bean and cheese tacos and mushroom tostadas for vegetarian visitors, a chips-and-salsa starter that comes with your choice of three of six salsa options, and side orders of Mexican street corn that are as authentic as it gets."
"Local buzz began to build about Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide — in 1998, when its second location opened in Rochester, and it amplified further when Dinosaur-brand barbecue sauces and other items began turning up in area supermarkets. And when the Buffalo location finally opened in February 2014, the local barbecue scene, formerly nothing to write home about, got a major shot in the arm: even the most ardent ""Buffalovers"" who've experienced it concede that local favorite-by-default '''Fat Bob's''' has some major catching up to do. Situated in a former Universal International Pictures film vault on Franklin Street, this location is smaller than others in the chain, but it's got the same rowdy roadhouse vibe and is brimming with historic character to boot. Dinosaur's fare is Kansas City barbecue done to perfection, lauded on the Travel Channel series ''Man v. Food'' and cited by many reviewers, media outlets, and satisfied customers as the best barbecue north of the Mason-Dixon Line — and by ABC's ''Good Morning America'' as the best in the whole country. Start with appetizers like out-of-this-world fried green tomatoes or ""Dino poutine"" topped with pulled pork, then move on to mains such as barbecue chicken, pulled pork, hand-sliced brisket, and catfish that come with your choice of sides (the mac & cheese is to die for and the peel-and-eat ""drunken spicy shrimp"" are gargantuan, but stay away from the bland ""A.K. Chili"") or as part of a range of combo platters, including a build-your-own option. Also available are some of the most mouth-watering ribs you've ever tasted, marinated all day in a secret spice rub then slowly smoked and glazed with just the right amount of Dinosaur's own barbecue sauce. Prices are decent, especially given the ''huge'' portions — those who are not so hungry might prefer lighter fare such as brisket and pulled pork sandwiches or various burgers — and service is efficient and exceptional, with a staff that's friendly to a fault and happy to point newbies to the best dishes on the menu."
"Opened in December 2015, Frankie Primo's is another milepost in Chippewa's evolution from one-dimensional strip of thumping dance clubs to multifaceted fine dining and entertainment destination. After 16 years as owner of '''Soho Burger Bar''' just down the block, Jay Manno jumped at the chance to open a second Chippewa Street eatery that would serve up some of the Italian food he grew up with — simple yet creatively conceived and well-executed specialties from his ancestral homelands of Sicily and Campania — in the former home of '''City Tavern''', whose old-school interior, with its exposed brick, warm-toned woodwork, and original tin ceiling, was a perfect match for the ""Little Italy-type restaurant"" he envisioned. Even the ""+39"" suffix in the restaurant's name is a subtle nod to his roots, being Italy's telephone calling code. The backbone of Frankie Primo's is a deceptively straightforward-seeming yet wide-ranging range of pizzas (fired in a brick oven; not too greasy, with a thin, crispy crust), pasta dishes (including the Roman specialty ''cacio di pepe'', the only place in Buffalo where you can find it), panini sandwiches (served on fresh, crusty ciabatta bread baked in-house), and main-course salads (the ''cavolo toscano'' is especially interesting; a heaping mound of kale topped with currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino romano cheese, and lemon vinaigrette), which come in ample portions and at prices that aren't half bad for what you get. About a dozen specialty cocktails are served up at the homey bar — classics like Negronis and Manhattans, plus more newfangled creations that still betray a strong classicist influence — and if you prefer your drinks at the table with dinner, the wine selection is encyclopedic."
"Kaydara Noodle Bar opened in August 2012 in the historic Sidway Building with a promise of ""a food experience unlike anything Buffalo has seen before"". True to their word, Kaydara's ambitious Asian-fusion cuisine delights lovers of Vietnamese, Lao, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine. The focus here is on noodle bowls — Kaydara's ''pho'' and beef udon bowl are particular favorites — which are complemented on the menu by fried rice dishes, salads and appetizers, and heartier entrees such as spicy black bean pork ribs and beef tenderloin. Vegetarians and vegans will also be pleased with the options offered at Kaydara."
"Located inside the '''Buffalo & Erie County Naval Park''' at Canalside, Liberty Hound is a celebration of seafood from across the U.S. and the world, in a wonderful lakeside setting convenient to all downtown and waterfront attractions. Traditional offerings such as Maine lobster rolls and crab boil share space on the menu with exotic and innovative offerings, such as steamed littleneck clams with chorizo garlic butter and a Vietnamese-style ''banh mi'' sandwich stuffed with crispy fried calamari, that can be found nowhere else in Buffalo. Best of all are the refreshing lake breezes and lovely views over the waterfront and downtown."
"Justin Anderson bills his new eatery as a ""kitchen and beer bar"" — and true to that designation (and mirroring the evolution of Chippewa Street as a whole), the former '''Noir''' nightclub has been revamped into a completely new establishment that offers something more than drinking and rowdy clubbing. The ""kitchen"" half of the equation serves up a classed-up take on pub grub — one major standout from among the list of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers (mostly of the deep-fried variety), personal pizzas, and main-course salads is the ""Ultimate Chicken Sandwich"", where flavorful, well-seasoned grilled chicken comes topped with avocado, goat cheese, tomato, fresh basil, bacon, alfalfa sprouts, potato chips, and pesto mayo for a dazzlingly complex yet ultimately harmonious blend of flavors. A few heartier entrees are on offer as well, including a beer-battered fish fry made with the '''Southern Tier Brewing Company''''s ""One Buffalo"" American blonde ale — a huge seller on Fridays. As for the latter half of the surname, it's a bit of a misnomer — sure, you've got a pretty good selection of craft beers on tap from local and regional brewers such as the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''', '''12 Gates''', and '''Resurgence''', but also cocktails made with about 50 types of bourbon, Scotch and rye. In every aspect of the experience, Local does justice to its name — from the local craft brews, to the Western New York-based suppliers the kitchen uses in many of its recipes ('''Camellia Meats''' provides the ham for the Cuban sandwich and the ham and mozzarella melt, for example, while the jalapeño mustard for the soft pretzel appetizer comes from '''Deb's Delights'''), to the huge ""Buffalove"" sign adorning the back wall, even to the interior: wooden beams from an old barn in Clarence were reused here as wall paneling and to build the bar, for a rustic look redolent of nothing so much as an Old West saloon."
"Those who have been paying attention may have noticed subtle changes afoot lately on the Chippewa strip — from a one-trick pony of thumping nightclubs to a much more multifaceted entertainment destination. The Lodge fits right in to that trend. Opened with great fanfare in December 2013, The Lodge is the brainchild of Adam March, a newcomer on the local restaurant scene who came to own the former location of '''Bayou''' nightclub by winning it from its former owner in a pickup basketball game. The Lodge is still part nightclub — it has a bar and party area on the upper floor that swings after dark, featuring a balcony with a sweeping panoramic view of Chippewa Street below — but its main raison d'être is an upscale restaurant, serving what head chef Fortune Macri describes as ""Bold New American"" cuisine, creative and upscale fare of diverse culinary influences. If it's a quieter experience you're after, head to '''The Observatory''', the Lodge's secluded second-floor patio with firepit and attached game room. Seafood reigns supreme on the menu, especially lobster, served milanese style and in a delightful take on mac & cheese; a selection of steaks and chops as well as more inexpensive pasta entrees are also to be had. The Lodge's appetizers are somewhat more adventurous, with Korean short ribs, chile rellenos, and moûles frites as popular options, as well as interesting sandwiches and burgers. The interior is intended to mimic the look of a mountain chalet or ski lodge, but architect Rohit Kapoor has brought a much less rustic and more modern touch to the design."
"Newly opened at the corner of Franklin and Mohawk Streets and already receiving rave reviews from hungry Buffalonians, Osteria 166 is a ""casual Italian eatery and pub"" that walks a fine line between the humble ""red-sauce Italian"" restaurants of Hertel Avenue and what's left of the Italian West Side, and the upscale establishments more typical of downtown. Entrees trend heavily toward the former, with classic favorites such as spaghetti and meatballs, shellfish fra diavolo, and an Italian sausage sandwich all making appearances on the menu. However, the appetizers are far more imaginative, with the creativity of the offerings in that category exemplified by grilled octopus, pork confit, and stuffed pepper risotto cakes. An impressive wine list caps off Osteria 166's menu in grand style."
"The fact that the Pan-American Grill was the first business to open when renovations to the Hotel Lafayette were completed in early 2012 is quite apropos: the restaurant's lush decor, featuring furnishings original to the Lafayette that date back to the first decade of the 20th Century, is a tribute to the Pan-American Exposition, which took place in 1901 and for which the Lafayette was constructed. The Pan-American Grill shares the same owner as the '''Pearl Street Grill & Brewery''' (see below), which means that aside from the fact that many of the delicious craft beers brewed and served at Pearl Street are also available here, the menu at the Pan-American Grill bears a great deal of similarity to the one at its sister restaurant. To call the cuisine here ""pub grub"" would be to do it an injustice, but nonetheless, the fairly elegant take on classic American cuisine served here splits the difference between upscale quality and prices that are far more reasonable than other Hotel Lafayette dining destinations such as '''Butterwood Sweet & Savory'''. A familiar yet creative range of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees are accompanied by an ample selection of flatbreads and a range of homemade pizzas available in ""Speak Softly"" (12"") and ""Big Stick"" (18"") sizes — another evocation of the Pan-American Exposition era. Simply put, the Pan-American Grill is one of the best options in downtown Buffalo for those in search of a decent sit-down meal that won't break the bank."
"One of the first fine dining establishments to challenge Chippewa Street's previously monolithic identity as a thumping clubber's paradise, Papaya opened its doors in 2005 on the ground floor of the '''Hampton Inn''' hotel. Serving daring Asian fusion cuisine with an accent on Thai and Vietnamese influences, as well as sushi, Papaya's menu is one of downtown's most innovative. Beer, wine, sake, and cocktails are served including excellent martinis."
"Located in a 1841 brick block in the middle of the former Canal District, which the menu describes as once having been ""the most evil square mile in America"", the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery does its best to evoke those bygone days with an upscale — and unmistakably Buffalo — take on traditional pub grub served in a setting that has been beautifully restored to mimic its 19th-century ambience. An interesting variety of burgers, sandwiches and wraps — including an astounding pulled pork sandwich served with North Carolina-style barbeque sauce, and of course, beef on weck — and hearty entrees are all served, but particularly recommendable are the variety of pizzas on offer at the Pearl Street Grill. Best of all, the restaurant also doubles as a brewery, with a variety of award-winning beers such as their signature brew, ""Trainwreck"", that are brewed on the premises, as well as a rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. The Pearl Street Grill is very busy on nights the Buffalo Sabres play at home, due to its proximity to the arena."
"After over a year of preparation, Bob and Dan Syracuse opened their long-awaited downtown Buffalo location of Pizza Plant in fall 2015, in the building at Canalside that's also home to '''Courtyard By Marriott''' hotel. Those who are familiar with the original location on Transit Road will be happy to know that the menu is exactly the same; for the uninitiated, the specialty of the house are '''pods''': like calzones but bigger, these football-shaped shells of pizza dough are as long as your forearm and contain your choice of pizza topping-style fillings (select from about two dozen specialty pods, or build your own). Equally worthwhile, though, are the selection of thin-crust and stuffed deep-dish pizzas, pasta dishes, and bread bowl salads (including, oddly enough, the best Greek salad in town), not to mention a craft beer selection that rivals anywhere else in Buffalo. Vegetarians, vegans, and the gluten-free crowd have a lot to choose from on Pizza Plant's menu, and craft beer tastings, live music, and other events are frequent."
"In what must be a contender for longest lag between initial announcement and opening day, Raclette's opened its doors on the 500 Block of Main Street in March 2016, after just a bit over four years of preparation. The fact that the delay was due to the need for a complete top-to-bottom reconstruction of its building — one that many claimed was too far gone to be saved — is testament to the dogged perseverance and dedication of owners Paul and Sandra Wilkens, equally to the preservation of downtown's period buildings as to the provision of a topnotch dining experience to their customers. The specialty to which Raclettes owes its name is a Swiss French dish that one might describe as a cousin to fondue — you place a large block of cheese on a flat grill to slowly melt, then scrape it off onto a platter that includes buckwheat crêpes, potatoes and/or gherkins, and your choice of charcuterie meats. It's a dish that's available nowhere else in Buffalo, and the friendly staff is happy to walk newbies through the process, but a quick meal this is not — Raclette's advises you to allow at least an hour and a half for the whole experience. If you're pressed for time or otherwise not interested, the balance of the menu is made up of serviceable bistro fare — an interesting selection of Belgian-style ''moûles frites'', main-course salads, and ''coq au vin'' and other classic Gallic fare are dished out at dinner, the lunch menu boasts a range of croques and baguette sandwiches, the French onion soup and vegetable bouillabaisse (the latter one of the few items on the menu suitable for vegans) are spectacular, and there's an extensive and reasonably priced selection of wines available by the bottle or by the glass. All this goodness is served up in one of two environments: an oddly laid out but warm and comfortable dining room, with exposed brick walls full of old-school charm and comfortable, slightly offbeat furniture for an effect described by one reviewer as ""like dining in a wealthy friend's cozy library"", or else outdoors on the breezy sidewalk patio facing Roosevelt Plaza. If there's a complaint to be made about Raclette's, it's that the portions are more European-sized than American-sized (let alone Buffalo-sized), but the reasonable price point goes a long way to compensate."
"Aside from being one of Buffalo's finest sushi restaurants, Seabar is one of the premier destinations in downtown Buffalo for cocktails and a wide selection of entrees, with Japanese cuisine accompanied on the menu by specialties such as short ribs, glazed duck breast, and linguine with clam sauce. Convenient to the Theater District and the Chippewa strip."
"Located at '''HarborCenter''' a stone's throw away from the '''KeyBank Center''', (716) is the perfect place to catch dinner before a Sabres game — and even if you don't have tickets, the experience at Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' is, in the words of one reviewer, ""probably better than actually going to the game"". That's because you can watch the Sabres (or pretty much any other team) in grand style on the 38-foot-high (11m high) big-screen TV situated front and center above the bar and visible from all over the restaurant, as well as some 70 more HD screens covering pretty much every interior surface right down to the mirrors in the restrooms. Fans of traditional sports-bar pub grub will be happy with the menu, but those looking for something a little more distinctive won't be disappointed either — the fare at (716) includes interesting twists such as beer-can chicken seasoned with a secret-recipe dry rub and served with jicama slaw, Buffalo mac & cheese and fresh hand-cut fries, as well as a charcuterie pizza topped with soppressata, prosciutto, spicy Calabrese salami, pepperoncini, peppadew peppers, and a blend of mozzarella, provolone, and ricotta cheeses. All the food is reliably good, but special praise is heaped on the ""Power Play Poutine"", smothered in locally-produced Yancey's Fancy cheese curds and a gravy that boasts a spicy kick (some speculate that they add Frank's hot sauce). At the extra-long bar, bright white and illuminated to imitate the ice of a hockey arena, you can enjoy a choice of three or four dozen beers available on tap and in bottles, including a great selection of local craft brews from places like the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. The weak link at (716) is the service, which is often dashed-off and indifferent, if still passable."
"""Let's enjoy city dining again"", implores Tappo's website, echoing the sentiment of a growing number of Western New Yorkers. Developer Rocco Termini and Buffalo restaurateur extraordinaire Mike Andrzejewski teamed up in 2013 to convert the former Horton Coffee building into this casual restaurant serving Italian fare that is familiar yet creative and well-prepared. Diners rave about delicious interpretations of classic favorites like lasagne, chicken cacciatore, and Italian wedding soup, as well as more imaginative options such as a basil prawn risotto and Tappo's lauded brasciole. The wine list features no fewer than 41 imported vintages, with a few domestic wines for good measure. Best of all, the value for what you get can't be beat — and neither can the view of the downtown skyline from the rooftop patio."
"With Toutant, owner James Roberts pays homage to his roots in Louisiana bayou country — he took the name of the trapping and fishing camp that has family operated there for many years and applied it to the Southern and Cajun food destination he opened in downtown Buffalo in 2015. Local old-timers may remember the building's previous tenant, the '''Golden Swan''', one of the diviest of the dive bars of old downtown Buffalo — but oh, how times have changed. Toutant has been utterly transformed into three floors of class, with a beautifully restored bar at street level and upper floors that boast great views over the skyline. The decor is understated and mindful of the building's historic character, with exposed brick predominating. But you're not here for the view or the decor, you're here to eat, and at Toutant the choice is from a menu that's underwhelming in size but superlative in quality. Start off with a slate of small plates (""sharing is caring"", the menu reminds you) that include delicious, flaky ""cast-iron cornbread"", fried pork cracklins that according to one reviewer ""taste like bacon-flavored chips"", and sausage and bacon smoked in-house, then graduate to main courses including excellent fried chicken — crunchy and not too greasy — or jambalaya whose spiciness you can adjust to your taste, like in an Asian restaurant. All the dishes at Toutant are made with locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible. Weak spots include the service, which tends to be fumbling, thoughtless, and glacially slow (this place is newly opened as of this writing, so take those criticisms with a grain of salt) and the noise level, which can be deafening when the place is crowded (''i.e.'' more often than not)."
"Opened in 1868 and named for a later owner, German immigrant Michael Ulrich, Ulrich's Tavern is Buffalo's oldest operating restaurant — despite the fact that it spent most of 2013 and 2014 intermittently closed due to the fiduciary woes of its former owners. Sadly, the German specialties that made up the heart and soul of its former iteration's menu are paid mere lip service, with maybe a half-dozen options, dubbed ""Ulrich's Favorites"", cordoned off to an isolated sector of the menu: you can get ''wienerschnitzel'', potato pancakes, ''rouladen'', and the ""Oktoberfest"", a platter of three German sausages and sides of sauerkraut and potato salad, but that's about it. The balance of the offerings consist of a slate of sandwiches, burgers and main-course salads that are upscale, but for the most part aren't anything you can't find elsewhere in the city. The sandwiches are big and hearty, though: local favorites like beef on weck and fried bologna with onions are present, the burger is a full half-pound of meat, and the shredded pork sandwich comes with pickles and is served on olive-pressed French bread. And while borscht is technically native to lands east of Germany, Ulrich's is one of the few restaurants in Buffalo where you can find it (and it's really good). As for drinks, Germanophiles who were disappointed with the food might like the beer and wine list better, with offerings from Germany and elsewhere."
"Appropriately named for the Roman god of wine, Bacchus has always been Chippewa Street's odd-man-out, offering a decidedly upscale and laid-back experience since long before the rest of Chippewa's thumping party bars began to follow suit. Located in the historic Calumet Building, Bacchus is owned and operated by Buffalo's premier restaurateur, Mark Goldman, which locals know makes for an experience of unrelentingly high quality where meticulous attention is paid to every detail. Impeccably prepared specialties of diverse influences — entrees such as panko crusted ahi tuna, steamed Prince Edward Island mussels, and duck confit share space on the menu — are complemented by an impressive wine list with a variety of glasses, half-bottles and full bottles available to suit all tastes. Now open for lunch."
"Proudly serving mouth-watering cuts of the finest aged USDA prime beef in an elegant setting, the Buffalo Chop House is the most exclusive restaurant in the city, with prices to match. What guests to the Chop House can expect, however, is luxury that is unmatched in the region, with a variety of steaks as well as pork, lamb and veal chops, chicken dishes, and mouth-watering seafood selections taking center stage on a menu that also features a huge selection of elegantly prepared salads and appetizers, the latter category predominated by seafood selections such as clams casino with apple-smoked bacon and tuna tartare with tomatillo and mango. In October 2014, owner Mark Croce also launched a ""5 for $55"" ''prix mixe'' menu inclusing an appetizer, main course with two sides, and dessert, the better for people to experience the Chop House ""without taking out a second mortgage"" (in his words). As for the interior ambience, it boastsh a '40s Rat Pack theme that was introduced as part of a recent $750,000 renovation, including a wood-panel inlay on the second-floor wall imported from Indonesia that features an image of Frank Sinatra. The Chop House also has Buffalo's finest banquet facility, the '''Franklin Room'''."
"In spring 2014, after a twelve-year stint on the corner of Franklin and Tupper, local restaurateur-turned-real estate magnate Mark Croce closed '''Laughlin's Beer & Barrel''', saying ""it was time for a change"". That change has come in the form of Buffalo Proper, a Roaring Twenties-themed cocktail bar and fine dining restaurant helmed by some of the heaviest hitters of the Western New York restaurant industry: executive chef Edward Forster, formerly of '''Mike A's at the Lafayette''', is joined by '''Vera Pizzeria''' founder John Karel and a pair of young upstarts he brought over from his most recent creation, Rochester's '''The Revelry''': Zack Mekida and Donny Clutterbuck. In a write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'', Buffalo Proper's food is described as ""honest American cuisine that honors the low country of the South"", but the maddeningly eclectic, immensely creative, and ridiculously upscale concoctions on the menu would be nearly unrecognizable to the average Southerner. For instance, they don't serve rabbit here: instead, it's ""tartine of rabbit en terrine"" with whole-grain mustard, arugula, pickled onions, and armagnac-apricot mostarda (whatever that is). Even that Southern favorite, slow-roasted pork, is crusted with candied malt, drizzled with an alegrette flavored with local craft beer, and accompanied by kohlrabi sauerkraut. A variety of steaks are offered, and if you're a fan of seafood, try the roast fluke with haricot, brown butter and toasted almonds, or the grilled wild sturgeon garnished with shallots and shaved apples. And yes, all this is as expensive as it sounds."
"Rated one of America's top ten steakhouses, E. B. Green's is located at the elegant Hyatt Regency Hotel & Suites, and is named after the man who was almost inarguably Buffalo's greatest architect, whose firm designed some of Buffalo's most architecturally significant buildings including the Hyatt itself. Skillful and attentive service, high-quality cuisine, and an upscale ambience combine to furnish patrons with a singularly elegant dining experience. Entrees include veal chops, seafood, duck, rack of lamb, and — of course — a dozen or more different cuts of steak. Sandwiches are available as well."
"At Marble + Rye, Mike Dimmer and Christian Willmott take the upscale touch they brought to Buffalo's food truck scene in 2013 with the '''Black Market Food Truck''' into the world of brick-and-mortar restaurants, with smashing success. Located across from the restored '''Genesee Gateway''' buildings in a part of downtown that's become known as an up-and-coming hotspot for fine dining, Marble + Rye's small but well-curated menu is divided up into a selection of small plates and a somewhat more modest slate of full-sized main courses, emphasizing in both cases fresh, seasonal ingredients that are locally sourced whenever possible. The large plates are more expensive but a good sight less creative — a half or whole chicken comes with various mildly interesting accoutrements such as pork-fat potato and oyster mushrooms, while the steak is a run-of-the-mill if well-executed 24-ounce seasoned T-bone — but it's with the small plates where Marble + Rye really fires on all cylinders (and don't worry, you won't leave hungry if you order one; portion sizes are much larger than what you'd expect in an upscale restaurant). On that half of the menu, you have pickled onion rings with green garlic aioli; a grilled octopus appetizer that's inconsistent in quality but out of this world when at its best, with charred scallion, jalapeños, and romesco sauce; and a choice of four phenomenal burgers served on homemade buns and cooked to order with a mix of sirloin, brisket, and chuck, perfect for those on a budget. These and other culinary delights are experienced in a dining room that's rustic and homey yet urbane — exposed brick and finished wood abound — and the bright lighting is a welcome change of pace for those who are tired of squinting to read the menu in fancy restaurants. The character continues at the trendy yet laid-back bar, where the selection is dominated by regional microbrews and a range of truly creative house-exclusive craft cocktails making heavy use of rye whiskey, that newly trendy spirit to which the restaurant owes half its name. Service is topnotch: attentive, knowledgeable, and not dashed-off. This place gets crowded, so reservations are recommended especially on Friday and Saturday nights."
"Building on his smashing success at '''Shango''' in University Heights, in September 2014 Jim Guarino launched downtown Buffalo's first seafood restaurant in forever in a 1940s-era building that once housed the '''Waldorf-Astoria Lunch Counter''' and was later a shoe store. Named for the Yoruba goddess of the sea, here a range of amazingly creative seafood concoctions are plated up with aplomb by a staff of servers that really knows their stuff. Oshun also has one of the most delicious raw bars you've ever seen, featuring between eight and ten changing varieties of shucked-to-order oysters from all over the world. The menu consists mostly of small plates — if you're dining with a group, they say it's best to order two to three selections per person and pass them around to share — and boasts standouts such as a creative take on calamari (coated with a pineapple tamarind glaze and topped with a grilled corn salsa), seared bay scallops over coconut rice topped with popcorn (it works, surprisingly), and delectable king crab, lobster, and fish dishes. For those who don't like seafood, grilled short ribs, Jamaican-style jerk chicken served with plantain fritters, and other land-based entrees call to mind the Cajun fare Guarino serves at '''Shango'''. At the bar is served an ample selection of wines, creative cocktails, and a slate of regional craft brews. Best of all at Oshun, though, is the decor: the extensive renovation not only preserved original Art Deco interior elements such as the frescoes on the wall, but enhanced them with modern touches for an upscale ambience that blends the Roaring Twenties with the 21st Century in luxurious style: an Atlantean decadence that seems a world away from Buffalo."
"One of Buffalo's finest French restaurants, Rue Franklin has served creative and upscale cuisine for over 20 years in a setting redolent of an intimate café in Paris. This lovely establishment also boasts a large and carefully selected range of fine wines. Rue Franklin is located in Buffalo's Theater District and is popular before and after shows, as well as for holidays, anniversaries and special occasions."
"Formerly Shanghai Red's, Templeton Landing is located at '''Erie Basin Marina''', a popular summertime hangout for boaters, walkers, joggers, and people-watchers. Boasting fine food and stunning views of Lake Erie from their patio that is open seasonally, Templeton Landing's entrees comprise hearty fare such as steaks, pork loin, burgers, and ribs, but the true pride of this place is their side dishes, which often share the spotlight with the main course rather than mere afterthoughts. Open all year, but summer is when you really want to come."
"The 31 Club began in the 1940s as Buffalo's premier supper club; though its original incarnation closed in 1983, it has now reopened in its original historic brick building on Johnson Park at the north end of downtown. The style and sophistication of the original 31 Club has returned, but with a contemporary twist. Freshly prepared Continental cuisine, such as Australian rack of lamb and filet mignon au poivre, is the rule at the 31 Club, as well as martinis and other specialty cocktails. Brunch and lunch are also served."
"Though the Buffalo waterfront is still primarily a warm-weather attraction, the slow growth lately in the trickle of wintertime visitors to places like the '''Erie Basin Marina''' was significant enough by 2015 for local restaurateur Molly Koessler — coming fresh off a successful makeover of her Black Rock restaurant, '''Acqua''' — to take a chance on a waterfront restaurant that would be open 12 months a year. Appropriately enough, it was on New Year's Eve that the ribbon was cut on William K's. Located next to '''The Hatch''' just past the entrance to the marina (there's always ample parking in the huge lot across Erie Street), William K's dining room is gifted with spectacular views over Lake Erie and across the mouth of the Buffalo River to the historic lighthouse — but unlike some other waterfront restaurants that are content to sell themselves based on scenery, this place follows through with food that's a cut above the competition in quality, elegance, and price. The menu here is smallish and could be described as an especially innovative take on the upscale steak-and-seafood template with the balance tipped decidedly in favor of the latter: the grilled Spanish octopus over chorizo and chickpea stew is a tantalizing combination of flavors and textures, and a changing selection of fresh seafood from the Gloucester Fish Market comprises the ""Boston's Finest"" seafood platter. Elsewhere on the menu, you've got a variety of steaks and chops, a roasted beet salad topped with burrata, masala milk powder, and locally sourced honey that's arguably the most popular item on the menu, and — for those with a smaller budget to work with — a selection of thin-crust brick-oven pizzas with some very interesting toppings (how about bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, fresh horseradish, and pecorino romano cheese?) Portions tend to be a bit on the small side for the money, but the service is unfailingly attentive and friendly, and there's an extensive wine list and some great craft cocktails at the bar."
"The newly renamed downtown outlet of '''Vasilis Express'''."
"Though it's the only game in town when it comes to downtown Buffalo grocery stores (for now — word is '''Tops''' has signed on as a tenant for a new high-rise planned for a site behind the '''Central Library'''), for years the Washington Market stocked an underwhelming selection of goods that could be charitably compared to an upscale convenience store. No more. A recent change in ownership has breathed new life into this stagnant downtown institution: drawing inspiration from the places new owner Michael Khoury used to frequent in his hometown of Brooklyn, like '''Foragers Market''', the Washington Market has teamed up with '''Buffalo Cheese Traders''', Niagara County's own '''Dispenza Meats''', and other Western New York producers to offer a much wider range of fine foods with an emphasis on locally-sourced items."
"A downtown tradition for over thirty years, the Downtown Country Market sees dozens of vendors converge on Buffalo's business district to the delight of office workers, local residents and visitors who come to purchase a wide range of farm-fresh produce, meats, baked goods, and flowers. The Downtown Country Market is a member of the Pride of New York Program, meaning that all goods sold there are produced in New York State."
"Named for and sponsored by '''Roswell Park Cancer Institute''', the Roswell Park Farmers' Market is held in '''Kaminski Park''', a lovely green oasis amid the gleaming new high-rises of the Medical Corridor. Each Wednesday afternoon in season you can pick up the usual assortment of locally-sourced fresh fruits and vegetables, baked goods, jams and jellies, and other specialty foods and gifts, including an especially good variety of cut flowers and ornamental plants."
"Mark Croce's nightlife destination just off Chippewa Street contains three different bars: '''[http://www.darcymcgeesonline.com D'Arcy McGee's Irish Pub]''' on the ground floor, '''[http://www.liftbuffalo.com LiFT Nightclub]''' on the second floor, and '''[http://www.buffaloskybar.com Skybar]''' on the top floor."

"Downtown Buffalo's largest hotel. Convenient to the KeyBank Center, Coca-Cola Field, and Canalside, with excellent waterfront views. Dry cleaning and laundry service, gift shop, pool, fitness club, business center, restaurant and bar (""Harbor Bistro"")."
"Located in the heart of the Medical Corridor and also convenient to Allentown. Business center, fitness center, valet parking, restaurant (""The Carlton Grill""). Connected to '''Roswell Park Cancer Institute''' and '''Buffalo General Hospital''' via covered walkways. Airport shuttle available."
"An all-suite property located in the Theater District and also near the Chippewa Street entertainment district. 24-hour business center with Internet and fax. Small fitness club. Guest laundry and dry cleaning service. Free buffet breakfast, and '''T.G.I. Friday's''' is located on site."
"This gleaming new property opened in October 2014 in the first fourteen floors of the thoroughly rehabilitated '''Tishman Building''' on the north side of Lafayette Square, and the rooms on the upper floors boast impressive views of the downtown skyline and Lake Erie from their huge windows. Guests can avail themselves of modern amenities such as a heated indoor pool, ample fitness center, 24-hour business center, complimentary wireless Internet and an onsite gift shop; 124 guest rooms all contain mini-fridges and microwaves, 39-inch LCD TVs, and MP3 alarm clocks. Kick back and relax in the large second-floor bar or by the fireplace in one of two conservatories, or have a bite to eat at the '''Garden Grille and Bar''' which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Valet parking is available at a rate of $18/day, or you can try your luck with on-street parking is available, though it's subject to metered rates and availability is quite scarce."
"An architectural masterpiece in the French Renaissance Revival style built in 1903 from a design by Louise Blanchard Bethune, America's first female architect of importance, the Hotel Lafayette re-opened in May 2012 after an extensive renovation that has brought it back to its former glory after years of neglect. The Hotel Lafayette is located on Lafayette Square in the heart of downtown and boasts shops, upscale apartments, and a 57-room luxury boutique hotel. Flat-panel TVs, banquet facilities, two restaurants (including the ""Pan-American Grill"") and two bars/lounges. Suites are available that contain full kitchens with refrigerator and stove. Complimentary breakfast."
"Convenient to the Theater District. One of Buffalo's finest business hotels. 3 bars and restaurants including Atrium Bar & Bistro, E. B. Green's Steakhouse, and Starbucks. Spa, fitness club, business center. Connected to Buffalo Convention Center."
"Opened in August 2015, this 205-room high-rise hotel is one of the showpieces of the new Buffalo, and its location can't be beat: the Marriott HarborCenter is located in the heart of the Canalside action, directly connected to the '''KeyBank Center''' and across the street from the historic rewatered Erie Canal terminus, with all of Buffalo's waterfront amenities an easy walk away. The luxurious guest rooms each feature a 55-inch flat screen LCD TV with premium cable and movies, a workstation that includes wireless Internet ($12/day) and multiple USB ports, a mini-fridge, coffee maker, iron and ironing board, and panoramic views over either Lake Erie or the downtown skyline. For shopping, dining, and nightlife, HarborCenter offers '''(716)''' sports bar, the fine dining restaurant '''Panorama on Seven''', a '''Tim Hortons''' coffee shop, and the snazzy '''Shops at HarborCenter''' — not to mention all the superlative offsite options that are only steps away — as well as a full fitness room, laundry, and dry-cleaning services. Parking is easily available in the HarborCenter ramp or the Marriott's private ramp, at $10 and $15 per day respectively."
"Opened in May 2014 in the former Donovan State Office Building (renamed '''One Canalside'''), the Courtyard by Marriott is one of several new hotels in the rapidly developing Canalside area. The sleek and stylish guest rooms are done in muted yet pleasant colors, and each contain a refrigerator, microwave, complimentary wired and wireless Internet, and a Smart TV with various apps. The Courtyard also boasts a business center, a fitness room, and an indoor saltwater pool and whirlpool spa. Dine at the onsite bistro or enjoy delivery service from local restaurants. Parking is available for a $12 daily fee."
"Brand-new hotel opened in 2009 to great fanfare. Complimentary breakfast every morning and nightly manager's reception featuring complimentary appetizers and cocktails. Pool, fitness club, business center."
"Located in the heart of the Chippewa strip and directly connected to many of the street's most popular bars and restaurants, including the '''Chocolate Bar''', '''Papaya''', and '''Salsarita's Fresh Cantina'''. Coin laundry ($1.50), gift shop, information desk, valet service, lounge, business center, fitness club, pool."
"The '''Webb Building''', also known as the '''Jewett M. Richmond Block''', was built in 1888 and is the finest example of Commercial Richardsonian Romanesque architecture remaining in Buffalo, but was vacant and falling apart in 2006, when local developer and preservationist Rocco Termini purchased the building and renovated it into a charming boutique hotel. Today, the Lofts on Pearl share with the adjacent '''Pearl Street Grill and Brewery''' not only an owner, but also an unequaled devotion to honoring Buffalo's history. This handsome property boasts 32 one- and two-bedroom suites with fireplaces, kitchens, full living rooms with sofa beds, and spacious closets, and can accommodate up to six guests each. Located in the heart of downtown in what has come to be called the ""Brewery District"", the Lofts on Pearl are convenient to shopping, dining, sports, and all other downtown and waterfront attractions."
"Buffalo's only hostel is a friendly, safe, and clean facility in the heart of the Theater District. The charming innkeeper and her hip staff run a first-rate facility — Hostelling International named it the third-best hostel in the United States in 2007, though Hostel Buffalo Niagara is no longer HI-affiliated — and are knowledgeable about local points of interest and worthwhile events and activities. Hostel Buffalo Niagara offers a choice of dormitory-style accommodations or private rooms, and boasts a full kitchen, game and media room, living room, and a small library. The walls of the guest rooms and common areas are decorated with works by local artists, many of which are donations from those who've exhibited at the adjacent '''BOX Gallery''' (see listing above). Hostel Buffalo Niagara is only steps away from '''Shea's Performing Arts Center''', the '''Alleyway Theatre''', and the '''Chippewa Street''' nightlife."
"Founded in 1855, Buffalo General is one of the oldest hospitals in the city. This 501-bed facility is especially well-known for its expertise in cardiovascular treatment, stroke care, and neurology, and is well-equipped to handle any medical emergency that might befall a visitor to downtown Buffalo."
"Built in 1855 to serve as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, the design of St. Joseph's Cathedral is based on that of Salisbury Cathedral in England, and its sanctuary boasts stained-glass windows that were donated by King Ludwig II of Bavaria."
"Located immediately behind City Hall, St. Anthony of Padua was built in 1891 in what until the 1950s was Buffalo's ""Little Italy"". Its school was the first one in the United States to be held in Italian. St. Anthony still holds one Mass per week in Italian, a nostalgic tradition that brings neighborhood old-timers back together again."
"St. Louis, the first Catholic church in Buffalo, was founded in 1829. At this early date in Buffalo's history, most of the city's Catholics were of French descent, and it was Louis Stephen LeCouteulx de Chaumont, a French nobleman from Rouen who had settled in Buffalo, who donated the land where the church stands today."
"Founded in 1851 by German-speaking Alsatians who split from St. Louis Church, St. Michael is significant as the first home of '''Canisius College''', a Jesuit school that is now Buffalo's largest private college."
"The seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral is the most architecturally distinguished church in Buffalo — built by Richard Upjohn in 1849 to replace an earlier structure built on the same site, the church has been named a National Historic Landmark, the U.S. government's highest level of recognition for a man-made structure, and it was the tallest building in Buffalo until 1912."
"The second-oldest Episcopal church in Buffalo, Trinity was founded in 1836. Its current building was erected in 1886 and is famous for its stained-glass windows, the work of prominent names like Louis Comfort Tiffany and John LaFarge — the latter of whom was responsible for ""The Sealing of the Twelve Tribes"", which was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle de Paris in 1889."
"Built in 1992, this meetinghouse serves the LDS Church's Buffalo Ward."
"This is the home of the Buffalo chapter of '''Soka Gakkai International''', a Buddhist sect that emphasizes pacifism, individual development and empowerment, and community activism. Group chanting and meditation sessions are offered, as well as other events and programs."
"Located in the foyer of the '''Glenn & Audrey Flickinger Performing Arts Center''' on the campus of one of Buffalo's foremost private prep schools, the focus here is on works in a wide range of media by local artists (especially current Nichols students and alumni, much of whose work is displayed at the adjacent '''SEEARTRUN Gallery''') or whose themes are relevant to Buffalo, Western New York, or the surrounding region. The Nichols School Gallery also hosts a range of travelling exhibits, workshops and visiting artist lectures."
"The Buffalo arts community first took notice of the once-forlorn empty lot behind '''St. Andrew's Episcopal Church''' in University Heights in 2013, when it was pressed into use as a staging area for the '''University Heights Art Crawl'''. Owned now by the University Heights Art Association — the community group that's behind that annual event as well as many of the outdoor murals you'll find on area buildings — the space has been transformed into a beautifully landscaped, intimately scaled outdoor garden centered on a stone-paved courtyard of ten platforms where sculptures and other works of three-dimensional art are displayed on a changing basis. St. Andrew's Sculpture Garden is open for temporary exhibitions as well as poetry readings, live music performances, and other events."
"The home of the University of Buffalo's permanent art collection, the Anderson Gallery was donated to UB in 2000 by David Anderson, the son of prominent New York City gallery owner Martha Jackson and a noted art collector in his own right; before that, Jackson had operated the gallery on his own since 1991. This state-of-the-art exhibition space contains selections from a collection of over 1,200 works of art in various media that represent a diversity of cultures and traditions, including many works by local artists. The UB Anderson Gallery also houses the complete archives of the Martha Jackson Gallery, covering the years 1952-1969, and of pop artist and UB alumnus Allen D'Arcangelo. An exciting selection of temporary and traveling exhibits are also displayed at the UB Anderson Gallery."
"Located just off Elmwood Avenue in Park Meadow, adjacent to Delaware Park, the newly renamed Buffalo History Museum has by far the most extensive collection of artifacts relevant to the history of Buffalo and Western New York from pre-Columbian times to the present day. Originally built for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, it is perhaps not surprising that the Exhibition is a particular focus of the exhibits at this wonderful museum. A Pierce-Arrow roadster built in Buffalo, the medal presented by George Washington to Chief Red Jacket, prototypes of the cardiac pacemaker invented by Clarence native Wilson Greatbatch, and artistic renderings of historical scenes and people flesh out the collection. Further historical records, manuscripts, photographs, and personal documents are housed at the Research Library. The Buffalo History Museum is also an invaluable resource for local residents interested in genealogy."
"Otherwise known simply as the ""Brain Museum"", the UB Medical School's Museum of Neuroanatomy is the only one in the United States dedicated exclusively to the human brain. Since 1994, this unique collection has comprised over 80 of these organs preserved in formaldehyde — both healthy specimens whose internal structures, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, are clearly displayed and labeled, as well as pathological specimens showing the effects of Alzheimer's disease, aneurysms, and other maladies on the anatomy of the brain. Exhibits are engagingly designed and accessible to everyone from the layman to the academic."
"With an area of 234 acres (93 ha), Delaware Park is the central node in Buffalo's park system, by far the largest park in Buffalo, and one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architecture anywhere. All the classic Olmsted features are present here: a large, grassy '''Meadow''' that is now the site of the Delaware Park Golf Course, thick stands of trees, and '''Hoyt Lake''', the 46-acre (18.5ha) pond in the southwest corner of the park that Olmsted originally named ""Gala Water"". An essay by Charles Beveridge on the Olmsted park system in Buffalo describes how well Delaware Park continues to fulfill its intended role as a place for Buffalonians to experience nature and greenery without leaving the city limits; Delaware Park, as per his essay, is ""the only public space designed by Olmsted in Buffalo that met his definition of the term 'park' — a setting of pastoral scenery extensive enough to provide complete escape from the artificiality and noise of the city."" Delaware Park is popular year-round, but is most often enjoyed during the warm months, when walking, bicycling, jogging, tennis, golf, and basketball are popular activities. Delaware Park is also the site of the '''Buffalo Zoo''', described in more detail below."
"Accredited by the '''Association of Zoos and Aquariums''', the Buffalo Zoo is the third-oldest zoo in the United States (founded in 1875 on the former site of the Deer Paddock at Delaware Park) and is second in popularity only to Niagara Falls among tourist attractions in the Niagara Frontier, welcoming 400,000 visitors each year. The 23-acre (9.5ha) Zoo boasts exciting thematic displays that play host to 1,200 different animals, such as elephants, bears, otters, sea lions, hyenas, and of course, bison. Some of the animals, such as a resident peacock, are allowed to roam freely on the walkways, allowing visitors to get closer to nature than they would in most zoos. In 2002, a new Master Plan was unveiled that will see the Zoo thoroughly modernized over the next 15 years. Under this framework, the Vanishing Animals, EcoStation, Otter Creek, Sea Lion Cove and South African Rainforest exhibits have already opened, with a new Children's Zoo and other exhibits slated for the near future."
"Inaugurated in 1974 as a gesture of friendship between Buffalo and its sister city of Kanazawa, Japan, Delaware Park's Japanese Garden is located on six acres (2.4ha) on Hoyt Lake, behind the '''Buffalo History Museum'''. This beautifully manicured oasis of greenery slopes gently down from Nottingham Terrace to the shore of the lake, also encompassing three small islands in the lake connected to the mainland by a lovely ornamental footbridge. Over the past years, the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy''' has been hard at work restoring and maintaining the more than 1,000 plantings of ornamental trees, shrubs and plants in the garden, including a large stand of Japanese cherry trees, and also have added or will soon add a stone garden and an authentic ''karesansui'' waterfall. Amid it all there are many benches and other sitting areas perfect for serene contemplation of one's peaceful natural surroundings."
"There are a number of installations of public art peppered around the grounds of Delaware Park. These include:"
"A bronze figure of a boy in American Indian garb crouching over next to his dog, bow and arrow in hand, ''The Indian Hunter'' is a replica of the statue of the same name that's on display in New York City's Central Park. According to the plaque on its pink granite pedestal, Buffalo's ''Indian Hunter'' was donated to the city in 1926 by Ella Spencer Darr in memory of her husband Marcus. The original sculpture is the work of artist John Quincy Adams Ward, and was cast in 1866."
"The first installation of public art to be placed in Delaware Park and one of the first in the entire city, this 4-foot (1.2m) bronze bust of the most prolific, prodigious and influential composer of the Classical era was sculpted by Olin H. Warner for the Buffalo ''Liedertafel'' — a fact that bears testament to the profound importance of the German-American community in Buffalo's history, who made up more than half of the city's population when the statue was dedicated in 1894. The statue's pink granite base contains a number of bronze plaques inscribed with biographical facts about Mozart's life, the titles of some of his important works, and honorifics. Today, Mozart serenely overlooks Hoyt Lake from a spot near the Buffalo History Museum."
"The most important work of the first half of Frank Lloyd Wright's career, and the first commission for that renowned architect outside of Chicago, the Darwin D. Martin Complex is one of the crown jewels of Buffalo's huge architectural cornucopia. The complex includes not only the Darwin D. Martin House itself — built in 1904-05 for the president of the '''Larkin Soap Company''' and Wright's longtime friend and benefactor — but also the '''George Barton House''', where Martin's daughter and son-in-law lived, the '''Gardener's Cottage''', and three buildings — a '''carriage house''', '''conservatory''' and '''pergola''' — which were demolished in 1962 and recently reconstructed according to Wright's original blueprints, the first Frank Lloyd Wright buildings ever to be rebuilt after demolition. Following over half a century of neglect, vandalism, and decay, the complex was purchased by the '''Martin House Restoration Corporation''' in 1994, with the extensive restoration process finally completed in 2010. For many local residents, the rebirth of the Darwin D. Martin House symbolizes the increased attention Buffalo's citizens are paying to their city's world-class architecture. A one-hour Basic Tour is offered, as well as a more extensive two-hour In-Depth Tour."
"Buffalo's Cherry Blossom Festival serves as both a tribute to the city's sister-city relationship with Kanazawa, Japan, as well as a fundraiser for the continuing upkeep of '''Delaware Park''''s '''Japanese Garden'''. This weeklong festival usually takes place about three weeks after its much more famous counterpart in Washington, D.C., with peak bloom in early to mid-May. In between admiring the lovely trees, you can also catch live music, take a boat ride on '''Mirror Lake''', and — especially — take a taste of Japanese culture with ''bunraku'' puppet theater performances and a traditional tea ceremony on the portico of the '''Buffalo History Museum'''. Expanding their scope far beyond the Japanese Garden, the Buffalo Cherry Blossom Festival's organizers also sponsor cherry tree plantings all over the city, and will even sell you one to plant in your own yard."
"The second-largest Italian-American heritage festival in the United States as well as one of the five largest street festivals of any description in the country, the Buffalo Italian Heritage Festival was held for ten years on Connecticut Street before it followed most of the city's Italian population, moving in 1988 from the Lower West Side to North Buffalo. Today, 600,000 visitors crowd the vicinity of Hertel and Delaware Avenues for four days each August to enjoy live music, carnival rides, and revelry of all kinds. The star of the show, of course, is the food, with offerings from such well-known Italian markets as '''Guercio & Sons''' and '''Mineo & Sapio Meats''' as well as demonstrations by chefs from Italian restaurants in the area such as '''Marotto's''' and '''Marco's Italian Deli'''."
"Located at the far northeast corner of the city, across Bailey Avenue from UB's South Campus, the Grover Cleveland Golf Course is one of Buffalo's most historic: as the home of the '''Country Club of Buffalo''' from 1900 until its move to the suburb of Williamsville in 1925, the course was the site of the first airplane flight in Western New York, which took off from here in 1910, and also played host to the 1912 '''U.S. Open'''. Now operated by Erie County, this 18-hole, par 69 course is one of the most challenging in Western New York. The Grover Cleveland Golf Course boasts a practice green, mens' and ladies' locker rooms, and a clubhouse and concession stand. During winter, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing is permitted from 7AM-dusk."
"You might be able to catch the occasional play such as ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" at this intimate black-box performance space on the third floor of the '''Pierce-Arrow Factory''', but the ALT Theatre is much more than a theater, let alone an off-Broadway playhouse. Describing itself as ""a hub for experimentation and innovation in the performing arts"", this is the place to catch avant-garde performances of new dramatic works as well as in diverse genres such as music, film, and dance. Though the occasional visiting performer passes through, the overwhelming focus of the ALT Theatre is on nurturing local talent — the shows put on here are truly one-of-a-kind."
"With a mission of enriching and enlightening audiences through the power of live theatre, the Kaleidoscope Thratre is an independent, award-winning production house dedicated to high-quality original material produced in-house, as well as occasional performances of classics such as ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' and ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change''. Kaleidoscope shows three plays per year, usually with a run of two weeks each, at the '''Lecture Hall Theatre''' in '''Medaille College''''s Main Building."
"The '''Manny Fried Playhouse''', named after a former Buffalo theatre actor, union organizer, and political radical and located in the former '''Pierce-Arrow Factory Complex''' in Park Meadow, is the new home of the Subversive Theatre Collective. This bold new troupe's mission is to present provocative works of drama that are ""dedicated to the needs, concerns, and aspirations of those who are oppressed, exploited, and disenfranchised by the existing social order"". The Subversive Theatre Collective has staged performances of works such as Maxine Klein's ''The Furies of Mother Jones'' and Bertolt Brecht's ''The Mother'', and has traditionally been an integral part of Buffalo's annual Infringement Festival."
"Owned by '''Dipson Theatres''', a local chain of movie houses, the Amherst Theatre is located at the University Plaza at the outer end of University Heights. It features three screens showing an interesting mix of indie and arthouse films, Hollywood blockbusters of the more high-concept variety, and the occasional foreign film."
"Almost inarguably the most distinctive movie theatre in the Buffalo area, the North Park was built in 1920 as an old-fashioned silent movie palace and still boasts an exquisite (and newly restored) Baroque interior with Art Deco flourishes. The single screen shows indie films almost exclusively. The North Park Theatre is also famous as the site of the world premiere of ""Buffalo '66"", the critically-acclaimed directorial debut of local native Vincent Gallo, which took place here in June 1998."
"16 screens showing standard big-name Hollywood fare."
"Situated at the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street and especially popular with students of nearby Buffalo State College, Voelker's may seem like it was plucked from another time. Behind a lively bar redolent of old-school Buffalo — the kind of place where you might see Pabst Blue Ribbon being drunk by rough-around-the-edges blue-collar types, rather than ironically by hipsters — are 36 bowling lanes, as well as three pool tables and a few dartboards. Open daily till 4AM, Voelker's is the place to go for late-night bowling in Buffalo."
"The oldest continually operating billiard hall in North America, Hippodrome Billiards opened in 1914 in the Theater District; through its early years of operation, some of history's great pool sharks, such as Minnesota Fats and Willie Mosconi, were regulars here. Sadly, Hippodrome is situated today in a nondescript suburban-style strip mall at the southwest corner of Delaware and Hertel Avenues. Despite the unfortunate location — and its spacious, bright and clean ambience that runs counter to the stereotype of pool halls — Hippodrome manages to conserve some of the old-school feel with chairs, cue racks, and several billiard tables retained from the original property. And, for those who'd rather skip the history lesson and just shoot a few games of pool, Hippodrome's rate of $4 per person per hour is hard to beat."
"After six years spent plying her wares as one half of the duo behind the Nyack, New York artisanal smithery '''Torch Song Metals''', Emily Sajban packed up and moved west, opening Bon Fire Craft in February 2016 at the recently vacated former home of '''Queen City Shaken & Stirred'''. Jewelry is the game here, and this is perhaps the only jewelry shop of its kind in Buffalo in that all stages of production take place in-house: these earrings, necklaces, birthstone pendants, rings, and other pieces are hand-forged, hand-cast, hand-carved, and gems and other inlays are hand-set by Sajban herself. There's definitely a house style here, but it's hard to put your finger on and may be impossible to describe in any succinct way — ""rustic"" might be the word that comes closest; popular artistic motifs include trees, leaves, and bears and other forest animals, as well as skulls and Indian-head nickels — and since every piece sold here either comes in a limited-edition run of no more than 50 pieces or else is custom-designed by Sajban to the specifications of a particular buyer, you can be assured that no matter what strikes your fancy on the shelves at Bon Fire Craft, you'll be the only one of your friends to have one! The selection is plentiful for men as well as women, and prices are easy on the pocketbook."
"Describing themselves as ""A Gem on Hertel"", Korona Jewelry has been a North Buffalo institution since 1900, making it the longest-running family-owned jeweler in Buffalo. Owner Joseph Korona, a consummate professional who is a graduate of the Gemological Institute of America, and his wife Noreen run the store in a way that combines the best of the old school — warm and friendly care given to each customer and old-fashioned pride taken in quality workmanship — with the latest in modern techniques and technology. Korona's stock in trade is new and vintage rings, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, watches, and other jewelry in gold and sterling silver, with a full range of diamonds and other precious stones. Bridal jewelry is a particular specialty, and staff is happy to work with customers to design custom pieces to their personal specifications. In addition, Korona Jewelry performs high-quality repairs, re-stringing and stone resetting, and replacement of watch batteries, accepts trade-ins, and buys gold."
"Modern Nostalgia is a cute women's clothing boutique owned by Nikki Polasik and Brianne Klejdys-Long, a pair of lifelong friends who are described on the store's website as ""Buffalo all-stars when it comes to style and fashion"". The ""style"" in question takes equal inspiration from elegant classic designs and exciting contemporary looks from up-and-coming designers — hence the name of the store — and makes the owners' infectious love of fashion all the more obvious. Customers adore ModNos — and forgive their somewhat high prices — because of their wide and changing selection of clothes (ranging from formalwear to more casual designs), lingerie, jewelry and accessories. The last two on that list are a particular specialty, with a massive range of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, handbags and clutches from collections by local and national designers, such as Pura Vida, Ornamental Things, and Made By Anatomy. As well, ModNos recently absorbed its erstwhile sister (brother?) shop, '''Blue Collar Buffalo''', and now stocks their line of rugged and masculine yet contemporary and stylish menswear under the same roof."
"The first thing a customer may think upon entering Peek-a-Boo Baby Boutique might be that for a storefront that looks so small from the outside and is so packed with merchandise, it has a remarkably airy, expansive feel, clean and cheerily decorated. Once that first impression is over, the customer may very well marvel at the large and adorable selection of previously-enjoyed items for children from newborns through toddlers — clothes, high chairs, bassinets, strollers, toys, and miscellaneous merchandise — all in impeccable condition. Most of the merchandise is consigned to the store by parents of growing children (call for details), but there are also some new items as well, much of which is the unique work of local designers. All items are 10% off after 5PM on Wednesday."
"P.S. Accessories boasts cute and fashion-forward clothes for all tastes, including plus sizes — but as the store's name implies, the star of the show here is the ample and ever-changing selection of jewelry, handbags, hairbands, leggings, belts, and other accessories, representing a style that encompasses diverse influences to suit all tastes, yet is distinctive and cohesive. The new items that constantly arrive at P.S. ensure that there's always a fresh slate of trendy items for shoppers to pore over. Best of all, the staff earns rave reviews for the friendly and helpful care they take of their guests, and the prices here can't be beat — the store's policy is never to charge more than $40 for any item!"
"Luxurious yet affordable menswear is the order of the day at Richel Formalwear. With a skillful and genuine approach to customer service honed over more than a quarter-century of experience, owner Carmelo Bandinelli attends to Buffalonians in search of elegant men's formal attire such as tuxedos, dress shirts, vests, three-piece suits, shoes, and accessories such as hats, ties, and cufflinks. The owner himself performs each custom fitting with a trained eye to perfection that's unmatched in the area, and also offers customized tailoring and alterations including jacket tapering. Richel Formalwear doesn't leave the opposite sex out in the cold, either: wedding dresses, bridesmaids' gowns, prom dresses, and other formal attire for ladies are available for sale or rent."
"Opened in 1998 on the West Side and moved to its current location four years later, Greg Link is the self-taught craftsman whose sculpture and handmade pottery can be found among the unique items for sale and on display in Cone Five Pottery's ample gallery space. The balance of the items here encompass works by over 50 artists from all over Buffalo and Western New York, in media as diverse as painting, jewelry, metal and wood art, photography, and blown glass, as well as occasional temporary exhibitions. In addition, open studio time for gallery members takes place at Cone Five every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday from noon till 9PM, and Donna Goeckel Martiny and Rachel Kofahl conduct pottery classes that range from basic skills like hand building, trimming and glazing to advanced techniques."
"After over half a century operating out of a breathtaking three-story French Second Empire-style mansion in Allentown, Dana Tillou moved his gallery to a smaller space on Hertel, and with that move came a change in focus: away from 19th- and early 20th-century American and British paintings and furniture to more contemporary pieces in line with the tastes of a new generation of art and design aficionados. If you've just come to ""browse"", though, never fear: a somewhat more selectively curated variety of works by artists from Buffalo and the surrounding region are still displayed at his gallery-cum-shop, with locally famous names like Martha Visser't Hooft, Carlo Nisita, and Evelyn Rumsey Cary represented. As well, Tillou has over 47 years of experience in professionally appraising art and antiques for insurance, estate, or personal purposes."
"A small storefront boutique gallery operated by the legendary Michael Morgulis out of a section of his Hertel Avenue shop, '''New Buffalo Graphics''' ''(q.v.)'', the Local Color Gallery's exhibit space features brightly colored, pop art-style prints with almost a comic-book look to them, where local themes predominate and Morgulis' background in graphic design is on full display. Works can be purchased in-store or online."
"Opened in 1988 as a small art gallery and frame store at the heart of the Hertel Avenue corridor, The Main Frame is a sister shop to the venerable Vern Stein Art & Frame in Williamsville, and serves also as the production facility for the custom-made frames sold at both stores. The Main Frame boasts a large selection of prints on display and for sale, with antique prints featuring local scenes and themes a particular specialty. The Main Frame's staff has over 30 years of combined experience in custom framing, and really does a marvelous job at it."
"A brand-new gallery opened in 2012 to great fanfare, Meridian West's owners, George Grace and Nancy Clarke Mariani, are both active members of the Buffalo Society of Artists and boast long and illustrious pedigrees in Buffalo's arts community (as a writer/artist and the chair of Lancaster High School's art department, respectively). Their work is on display and available for sale in Meridian West's airy, minimalist exhibit space, as are paintings, sculptures and mixed-media works by other local and regional artists such as Gary Wolfe, Ann Gunderman, and Rita Argen Auerbach. A small selection of gifts is available for those of a creative disposition. In addition, theatrical and musical performances, poetry readings, art and writing classes, and community events of all types are frequently held at Meridian West."
"The credo here is, ""We may not be big, but we're small"" — and so it is at State of the Art, where the staff consists of Mar Penner Griswold, a certified picture framer with over 40 years of experience in the field, and her ever-present feline companion, Lucy. Since 1982, State of the Art has been a Hertel Avenue mainstay, with the store's website vaunting a full range of services including framing, frame repair, photographic repair and restoration, matting, glass replacement, and — yes — cat advice. Customers rave about Griswold's helpful advice on style and color, patient and sincere service to her clients, and fair prices."
"The Antique Lamp Company is where, since 1997, longtime antique aficionado John Tobin has offered for sale a full selection of antique and vintage lamps and light fixtures in 19th- and early 20th-century styles such as Victorian, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Mission, and Art Moderne. Western New York's only full-time, professional lamp restorer, Tobin's work in repairing and polishing these pieces to restore their former brilliance truly betrays the boundless love he has for what he does. A wide variety of fine china, timepieces, jewelry and accessories, flowers and gifts round out the offerings at the Antique Lamp Company. The cherry on top is the decor, whose opulent elegance extends to the soft music and subtle fragrances that delight customers as they shop."
"Dealing in a wide selection of wholesale antique furniture, timepieces, china, sterling silver, light fixtures, and decorative accessories, Buffalo Antiques is a massive emporium that's been in business on Hertel for over fifteen years. In addition to the antique items, which represent Victorian and 19th-century European styles through the Mid-Century Modern period, a variety of new furniture is also sold here: Buffalo Antiques is a licensed dealer of the Maitland-Smith and LaBarge brands. As well, these fine folks are always on the lookout for quality items to purchase, from single items to partial and total estate sale liquidations. Buffalo Antiques offers free estate sale consultations and fair-market appraisals of antique items."
"This store's name is an unfortunate misnomer: though they will gladly purchase your unwanted jewelry, coin collections, ad nauseam, this is much more than just another sleazy old-gold dealer. The much more interesting half of the operation is built on owner John Marfoglia's nearly two decades of experience buying and selling at antique shows nationwide, which has put him in touch with some of the leading dealers and collectors in the United States. The fruits of those relationships are on full display in this Hertel Avenue showroom which was described by one satisfied customer as ""like the best parts of an estate sale were put together in a small shop"". Among the maddening diversity of antiques available here, specialties include weaponry including guns, knives and Japanese swords, ""modern vintage"" paintings, sculptures and other art, and Oriental rugs. Fans of the usual array of furniture, timepieces, light fixtures, jewelry and collectibles won't be disappointed either. JM Gold Buyers are also happy to provide you with a fair-market appraisal for your antiques (they even do online appraisals!) and manage your estate sales."
"If there were a competition for the store with the most accurate, short and to the point name in Buffalo, this place would win it hands down: simply stated, if you have a mancave and you need to outfit it, this is likely to be the first, last, and only stop you'll need to make. That's especially true if you're a beer fan, as the main focus of the inventory that owner Jonathan Gill has put together consists of antique collectibles from the golden age of Buffalo brewing: vintage neon signs, wall clocks, steins, ice chests, and bottle openers emblazoned with the old '''Iroquois''' and '''Simon Pure''' logos abound (if you're not familiar with or interested in those Buffalo brands of yore, never fear; they've got old-timey national-brand merchandise too). But that's only half the story: in partnership with the '''House of Jacob''' with whom they share the building, Man Cave Outfitters also offers a wide selection of restored vintage guitars and other musical instruments, and there's even a custom jeweler who practices his craft in a small nook in the back of the store. Prices are fair, and if you have a piece of antique ""breweriana"" of your own that you'd like to unload, Man Cave Outfitters can help with that too."
"Owner Frank Scheuttle has a long history in every aspect of the world of arts and antiques: well-versed in art history and theory thanks to his M.A. in American Folk Culture from the New York State Historical Association's Cooperstown Graduate Program, and tempered in the business side of the field with 40 years of experience as a collector, consultant, dealer, and museum curator. Silent Voices, his Hertel Avenue storefront and gallery space, contains a wide selection of artworks, quilts, crafts, and antiques on display and for sale that represent all facets of the Americana that is the object of his encyclopedic knowledge, boundless enthusiasm, and genuine love."
"Like '''Dana Tillou Fine Arts''' down the street, the WEBB Exchange is a place that's gone through a metamorphosis lately: it was in December 2015 that owners Matt and Kristeen Webb relaunched the art and antique shop they'd opened two decades earlier as '''Webb Trading Company''', with a newfound focus on high-end midcentury furniture, decorative baubles, and artworks sourced from the private warehouse in downtown Buffalo that serves as a clearinghouse for the pieces they acquire from estate sales and dealers around the country. And the ""high-end"" part cannot be overstated: among the designer furniture you'll find names like Saarinen, Eames, and Knoll, and they had an original Picasso painting for sale as of December 2015. If midcentury is not your style and you prefer the 18th- and 19th-century antiques of the old Webb Trading Company days, there's plenty of pieces like that to be found as well in the WEBB Exchange's 3,000 square feet (275m²) of floor space."
"The selection at this small used book shop directly across from the North Park Theater may not be the widest, but the Second Reader makes up for that with the quality of its merchandise and the friendliness and enthusiasm of its staff — not to mention the surprising and unusual finds that can often be encountered on the shelves there. The Second Reader's excellent prices are exemplified by the ""$1 Book Table"" which makes regular appearances in season on the sidewalk in front of the store. In addition to books, a range of prints, gifts and other ephemera are available here."
"Located at the corner of Hertel and Parker Avenues since 1988, the aptly named Hertel-Parker Liquor Store bucks the usual local trend of stores of this type: customers prefer the massive variety, range and quality of the liquors here to the more modest range of wines. Nonetheless, this independent business is renowned for the friendly and helpful staff that curates the selection. A sticking point among locals is that the owners seem to regard the opening hours as more of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule."
"Though she'd been thriving since 2011 at her original location in Lewiston, Savory Sips' move four years later to the more centrally located Hertel Avenue strip was a happy homecoming for owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter. Though casual passersby along the main drag might miss this place — it's tucked away behind '''Daisy's Doghouse''', with an entrance facing Norwalk Avenue — this charming European-style wine boutique is worth seeking out for the expansive selection of vintages on offer. Though the selection here spans every variety and geographic region imaginable, Savory Sips' is far from a kitchen-sink approach: all the wines Christie stocks on the shelves are individually selected, organic, small-batch vintages priced under $27 per bottle (more expensive wines, including some very hard-to-find selections, are available by special order on request). Matching the wide-ranging selection is Christie's encyclopedic knowledge of the products she stocks and of the wine industry in general, and she puts that knowledge to full use for her customers whether it be helping with a pairing or just talking shop with fellow wine lovers who stop in. The interior of the store is Christie's handiwork as well: with walls painted in rich, warm earth tones and a hand-built wine bar in the back, the space looks like Tuscany by way of Mexico. About the only weakness Savory Sips has is a disappointing selection of local wines, but do ask the owner about the group wine-tasting excursions to the Finger Lakes, the Niagara Peninsula, and other nearby winemaking regions that she offers through her side business, '''Village Wine Tours'''. Free public wine tastings are also held once a month; see the website for details."
"A local business that's already well-loved and well-established in the Elmwood Village, this second location of the venerable Village Beer Merchant opened in 2012. To put it succinctly, this place is heaven for Buffalo beer snobs. As is perhaps obvious, the specialty here is a slate of brews that gives the perennial favorite local beer store, '''Premier Gourmet''', a run for its money: a dizzying gamut of imports, local and regional microbrews, and seasonal selections curated by a knowledgeable and friendly staff eager to direct customers toward the beer that's right for them. However, Village Beer Merchant's Hertel location does Elmwood one better with a full tasting room where customers can sample from among the many brews in stock. Vilage Beer Merchant is also a destination for those in search of a wide variety of gourmet specialty foods, with a range of artisanal cheeses, fine olive oils, chocolates, teas, Boar's Head deli meats and other charcuterie, and other upscale edibles."
"Tasty Middle Eastern groceries of all types are the order of the day at Al Noor, with the crowded aisles of this little place fully stocked with everything from spices to Turkish coffee to canned vegetables to sheesha to a small selection of frozen foods. This stuff is the real deal, authentic and delicious — especially the halal meats that are the specialty here. Interestingly enough, British visitors will note that this is the only place in Buffalo that stocks '''Vimto''' soft drinks."
"Though owner Diane Serra's brief experiment in running Caramici's as a full-service bistro is over, this longtime Little Italy institution remains renowned for the delicious desserts crafted by owner Diane Serra, a native Bostonian with over 18 years of experience as a pastry chef. ""Caramici"" in Italian means ""dear friend"", and the owner is fond of saying that everyone who walks in the door is treated like one — and around here, that's more than just a cute joke. Walk through that door and you'll immediately get the feeling of being in one of the charming little pastry shops in Serra's old stomping grounds of Boston's North End, then head up to the counter and be bowled over by the sight of delicious gourmet cakes creatively and expertly custom-decorated for whatever occasion you can think of (wedding cakes are a specialty). If you've got something smaller in mind, though, Caramici's still has you covered with a full slate of Italian pastries and sweets such as cannoli, tiramisu, biscotti, and — for an authentic taste of Buffalo you'll find nowhere else — even pastry hearts."
"In the heart of Buffalo's Little Italy, appropriately enough, is found this delightful old-world food shop that seems to have been plucked from another time. Caruso's Italian Imports is a purveyor of delicious yet unpretentious imported foods which has earned more than its share of loyal customers over its 40 years of operation in North Buffalo. Found here is a myriad of delectable Italian specialties such as pasta, cheeses, olives and olive oils, fresh-baked breads, fine charcuterie such as prosciutto and mortadella, and fresh vegetables. The old-fashioned warmth and friendliness exuded by Caruso's employees is matched by the prices, which are among the lowest in town for specialty groceries of this type."
"Besides being a real ""live wire"", Earnest Thomas is a habitual truth-teller — stop in and you're as likely as not to be met with a greeting like, ""Hello, my name is Earnest, and I cannot tell a lie"". And that penchant for often blunt honesty extends to the name of the store: the seafood sold here truly lives up to the place's name, with only the freshest and highest-quality products delivered to Western New York courtesy of the connections he made during the 25 years he spent working as a seafood inspector for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation before returning in 2010 to open a seafood shop in his hometown of Eden, followed by this second location in North Buffalo six years later. If you're planning to pay a visit to Exclusively Alaskan Good, you might want to carve out a bigger block of time than normal — Thomas is a walking encyclopedia of edible marine life, and will regale you at interminable length with the minutiae of seemingly every piece of fish he sells, as well as tales of life on the high seas off the coast of Alaska, local political banter delivered with the opinionated tone you rarely find outside of small towns, and endless jokes as he packages your order. What's for sale? Salmon makes up a big part of it, all sourced from the wild and typically available fresh, smoked, canned, or ground into burger patties, as well as crabs, clams, scallops and other shellfish — or if you're not in the mood for seafood, check out what may be Buffalo's best selection of venison and game meats, with oddities such as elk steaks, caribou jerky, and alligator meat available for pretty good prices."
"Sandy Hofschneider spent many years working as a registered nurse in North Carolina; this brand-new Hertel Avenue storefront represents the second phase in her professional life, where her efforts at promoting the health and wellness of the community come through the sale of healthy extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars — and at great prices. Easily the most interesting products sold at the House of Olives are the flavored olive oils, where the imported extra-virgin oils that are also sold plain come infused with the delicious aromas of fresh basil, jalapeño, Meyer lemon, garlic mushroom, and more. Infused vinegars are also sold, with blackberry, raspberry, hickory, and chocolate among the available flavors. Best of all, customers are well attended to at the House of Olives, with the friendly owner always on hand to suggest pairings, share recipes, or — true to form — extol the myriad health benefits of extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars."
"The west end of the Hertel Avenue strip has a growing cluster of ethnic food shops that all stock basically the same selection of Middle Eastern packaged groceries, frozen foods, and other goods. Jerusalem Halal Market is no different in that regard, but what does set it apart from the competition is the pleasant shopping experience: the store is clean and brightly lit, the merchandise is well-organized, the aisles are easy to navigate, and customer service is friendly and attentive. As well, Jerusalem has an in-house butcher that sells fresh meat (100% halal, like everything else sold here) several days a week; if it's closed when you stop in, there's always an ample selection of frozen meats. Rounding out the inventory is a relatively modest selection of fresh produce as well as hookah pipes, headscarves, and other Islamic clothing."
"Since 1960, Johnny's Meats has offered for sale a full range of meats, cold cuts, and cheeses, many of which are produced locally. Johnny's homemade Italian sausage, crafted with a secret blend of herbs and cheeses, is a specialty, but it's also just the beginning of the story — this real, old-fashioned butcher shop sells it all. Beef, lamb, bacon, veal, locally produced Sahlen's hot dogs, seafood, pork, poultry, and delicious homemade meatballs all keep Johnny's loyal customers coming back for more. In another nod to Hertel Avenue's status as the epicenter of Buffalo's Italian community, a small line of pasta products is also available."
"Run by husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo, these founding tenants of the West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''' proved so immediately popular that, barely a year after opening, they'd outgrown their booth there and moved to Hertel Avenue, where they share the same (larger) space near the east end of the strip. The goods they sell are the same as always, though: Eric's stock in trade at the '''[http://www.pastapeddler.com Pasta Peddler]''' is gourmet goodies like imported olives and oils, balsamic vinegars in a variety of flavors, honey, and a selection of delicious artisanal fruit butters — and above all, as the name implies, a line of handmade gourmet pastas (including premade packaged ravioli to take home) and sauces. Linguine is a particular specialty; it comes plain as well as in a wide range of flavors such as spinach, jalapeño pepper, or tomato basil. As for Andrea's '''[http://www.blackbirdsweets.com Blackbird Sweets]''', a wide range of gourmet pastries are sold that deliver, in her own words, ""confection perfection and wow with every bite"". You can get cookies, muffins, pies, tarts, and lots of other home-baked delights at Blackbird, but the marquee product are cupcakes that come in a diverse selection of flavors — sugar cookie, salted caramel, and oatmeal chocolate chip are among the more interesting ones — crafted so artfully that one reviewer described being hesitant to bite into them. Consensus says that the cake has real heft to it and the frosting is not overpowering in its sweetness. And in the winter months, taking a cue from their former home at '''Horsefeathers''', the Amodeos team up to host the '''Winter Market on Hertel''', featuring local farmers and food artisans."
"The name of the game at Bella Mia is rekindling the memories of nostalgic customers with ""retro candies"" from their childhoods. For sale here are old-school favorites like Laffy Taffy, Lemonheads, Necco wafers, and Abba Zabba chocolate bars, Cadbury and Mars candy bars that are imported from Canada and especially popular with customers from north of the border, and delectable oversize lollipops of the kind that will remind customers of a certain age of summers at Crystal Beach. Other confections such as licorice, chocolate truffles, and bubble gum are available as well — and what would a candy store in Buffalo be without a huge selection of sponge candy (available in half-pound, one-pound, and two-pound boxes)? An ice cream counter, coffee and cappuccino, and vintage gifts such as Beatles posters and old-fashioned metal Elvis lunchboxes round out the inventory here. Customers rave especially about Tom, the friendly, down-to-earth owner who always makes sure every visitor to Bella Mia leaves happy."
"Hertel Avenue is the latest setting in the long, itinerant saga of Chow Chocolat: owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz got his start in 2007 in the downtown Theater District, then bounced over to Elmwood for a few years, then to the basement of the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the West Side, and finally, in January 2015, to a former law office in the heart of the North Buffalo action. Though the location may have changed, Chow Chocolat's stock in trade is the same as always: small-batch chocolates and caramels artisanally handcrafted using the finest ingredients: milk from grass-fed cows on local farms, locally-sourced, organic and GMO-free fruits, and more. These delectable goodies, along with delicious house-blend coffees and hot chocolates (try the salted caramel!), are sold to you by an owner who clearly takes pride in his works and in the relationships he's cultivated with his loyal customers that have followed him in his game of musical chairs around the city. Prices are a touch on the high side, but again, you get what you pay for."
"In November 2015, Phil Machemer finally took the brisk business he'd done for a few seasons selling records on Saturday mornings and afternoons out of a stand at '''The Peddler''' on Elmwood Avenue and parlayed it into a brick-and-mortar store on Hertel in the former site of '''Deja Lu''' — and, in so doing, became the most recent piece of a mini-explosion of new record shops in Buffalo that's most welcome in the years after the demise of the venerable '''Home of the Hits''' and '''New World Record'''. As has become the rule among these new shops, vinyl is the name of the game at Revolver Records. On the racks in this pleasantly airy, brightly-lit space is a gargantuan yet carefully-curated kaleidoscope of some of the most interesting, obscure, sought-after, and above all, ''best'' music on the planet — over 15,000 titles spanning all genres and time periods from the 1950s to the present; everything from popular favorites to hard-to-find imports to offerings from Buffalo's local music scene, all accurately graded. There's a limited selection of music on CD and other formats too. Whatever interests you, be assured that Phil's encyclopedic knowledge of music is at your service — and if you're still not sure, Revolver provides a listening station where customers can listen to any record for themselves before purchase; a service that's unique in Buffalo. Revolver will also buy any old vinyl you might want to unload — a specialty here is entire collections in a specific genre — and prices are fair whether you're buying or selling."
"Since 1925, Conley Interiors has been a trusted source for a diverse selection of high-end furnishings. Their 25,000 square feet (2,300m²) of showroom space extends across three floors and is chock full of stylish sofas, coffee tables, end tables, bedroom sets, chairs, lamps and light fixtures, mirrors, wall coverings, original works of art, and other decorative elements. Represented among its inventory are major brands such as Maitland-Smith, Somerset Bay, LaBarge, and Hickory Chair, as well as custom-made pieces from small workshops all over the world. Conley Interiors also proudly custom-designs interior spaces to their customers' specifications — in fact, it was named in 2002 by ''Architectural Digest'' magazine as one of Western New York's top interior-design firms. Conley's aesthetic is characterized not by a slavish devotion to one signature style or to the latest trends, but to a timeless ambience that harmonizes the best elements from a diversity of influences."
"According to his business' website, Michael Donnelly has, with his partner Tony Rogers, been ""creating beautiful environments for over 20 years"" through his eponymous interior design firm and retail furniture showroom at the heart of the Hertel strip. A wide range of high-quality contemporary furnishings, shelving units, lamps and light fixtures, carpeting, and upholstery produced by a host of renowned major brands are available for sale in their expansive retail space. The pieces offered here are arranged impeccably so as to draw customers in and let them really experience the designers' aesthetic. As well, Michael Donnelly Interiors offers a host of interior design services for single rooms or the entire house, including arrangement, re-accessorizing, consultation, real estate staging, and interior makeovers of all kinds; customers praise Donnelly and Rogers again and again for the attentive and personalized service they give to each of their clients, working with them every step of the way to attain results that are distinctive and of the highest quality. A selection of kitchenwares, greeting cards, and various stylish upscale gifts round out the offerings at Michael Donnelly Interiors."
"Modern & Ancient is a brand-new resale furniture shop located in a quiet setting a short walk off the beaten path of Hertel Avenue. The name of the business splits the difference between the store's two divergent focuses — also sold here are a variety of antiques of ancient vintage, with a special focus on pieces from Sub-Saharan Africa — but Modern & Ancient's bread and butter is a variety of mid-century furniture and home decor that represents the owner's 20-year collection of vintage items. Chairs, end tables, office furniture, accent pieces, and artworks are on offer, as well as large items such as sectional sofas that come in occasionally and are available at blockbuster bargains if you come at the right time. Modern & Ancient also deals in salvaged industrial furniture for aficionados of that aesthetic. Discounts are available for students as well as current and retired military."
"Opened in 2005, room is a luxury furniture boutique situated in an airy, architecturally interesting showroom at the heart of Hertel. Described by one reviewer as ""a fantasy world of what my living room could be like"", in a pleasant ambience of scented soy candles and elegant chandeliers are placed a bevy of classic modern furniture, dinnerware, rugs, textiles, and other decorative elements and accessories. The brands room carries are not only stylish and cutting-edge, but are often locally manufactured and are united by a commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly production. Also on the same site is '''babyroom''', an outlet for contemporary baby items such as cribs, bunks, strollers and other accessories that, in the words of its website, ""epitomize 'baby cool'"". These items are high-end and priced accordingly, so come prepared to splurge — if not, sales and promotions do occur on a regular basis. As well, room's staff gets points for being friendly and helpful without crossing the line into pushiness or annoying overhelpfulness."
"Two stores under one roof, these purveyors of furniture and home decor moved to the heart of the Hertel Avenue strip after a short stint in Allentown:"
"Custom lighting is the name of the game here — you may have seen Andrew Emerson's work illuminating downtown hotspots '''Toutant''' and the '''Big Ditch Brewery''' — and the house style is a smart and somewhat whimsical take on industrial chic. Chandeliers and desk lamps are crafted in deceptively simple designs using reclaimed metal tubing, with an end result that's almost worthy of hanging in an art gallery, yet you can also find new-material lamps and sconces done up in a delicious retro style."
"Sean Wrafter first came to the attention of Buffalonians in 2014, when he turned heads as the designer and builder of the beautiful wooden bar at the newly minted downtown fine dining destination, '''Toutant'''. Today, along with his wife Jackie, he's in business in the heart of the local design district offering to the buying public the same caliber of custom-built furniture: high-quality, one-of-a-kind, locally produced pieces designed by Wrafter himself and sold at surprisingly affordable prices. The Wrafterbuilt aesthetic is simple and elegant, inspired by but not enslaved to the sleek modernism of the middle of the last century, and in all cases upcycled from locally-sourced reclaimed wood and other materials, the better to preserve the old-school quality of workmanship while helping reduce the environmental strain caused by demand for new materials. The interior of Wrafter's shop strikes a balance between art-gallery minimalism and rustic hominess, with abundant polished wood (appropriately enough!), and smaller decorative baubles bring out a whimsical touch — check out Wrafterbuilt's line of custom-refurbished axes and hatchets!"
"Though it plays perpetual second banana to '''Terrapin Station''' two blocks further down the drag, Headin' to Hertel is still an excellent source for tie-dyes, ""hippie""-informed clothing, accessories, and jewelry, incense, and other such goods. However, what really distinguishes this place is the selection of glass art it offers — Headin' to Hertel lays a strong claim to being Buffalo's premier glass gallery. Custom orders for glassworks are filled by Jason and Aaron, a duo of glass artists whose works are available exclusively through Headin' to Hertel, and a bevy of other pipes and other works of glass art are available in-store. Glass-blowing lessons are even offered periodically. Customers praise Headin' to Hertel not only for the impeccable quality of the products sold there and their friendly and knowledgeable staff, but also for their commitment to the glass art community in Buffalo and the surrounding region — all of the items sold there are made in the USA, and the majority are produced locally."
"Since 1988, Buffalo's premier head shop has been encouraging locals of all stripes to (in the words of the radio spots that are all over the local airwaves) ""stop in and say hi"". A wide-ranging gamut of tobacco products, t-shirts and other clothing, tie-dyes, jewelry, incense and body oils, and new-age gifts such as crystals and tarot cards are available at Terrapin Station, all united by that distinctive aesthetic familiar to those who are still on that ""long strange trip"". Perhaps not surprisingly given the store's name, Terrapin Station is also Buffalo's foremost source for Grateful Dead-themed merchandise; concert tickets are also sold. Best of all, this eclectic selection is curated by a friendly, mellow staff that goes above and beyond to ensure that customers are well taken care of and have a pleasant shopping experience."
"As the name suggests, hair braiding and extensions are the main order of business at Germa's. However, a secondary attraction at this friendly brownstone storefront is a wide variety of African-themed clothing, jewelry, decorative items, gifts and knickknacks, as well as African movies on DVD. Bath and body products are a specialty here — including imported shea butter, body oils and incense — and likewise for authentic artisanal items such as masks, baskets, objets d'art, drums and musical instruments. Clothing for men, women and children in brightly-colored tribal prints is also on offer at Germa's. The hours of operation are particularly convenient as well — this place is open six days a week, and relatively late."
"Operated for over 25 years by owner Maria Pileri, Maria's Italian Gifts is a one-stop shop on Hertel that deals in high-quality goods imported from Italy, including fine Capodimonte-style porcelain, crystalware, objets d'art including carved decorative items in Argento 925 silver and imported wood, greeting cards, figurines and baubles, and other gifts. The specialty here, however, is ''bomboniere'' (wedding keepsakes) — visitors to Buffalo who are looking for the perfect wedding gift, invitations, or the like, or unique gifts for other occasions such as baptisms, bridal or baby showers, or anniversaries, can scarcely do better than Maria's."
"New Buffalo Graphics offers a range of items — t-shirts, prints, cards, mugs, and miscellaneous gifts — united by their local focus. If you want to commemorate your visit to Western New York with high-quality merchandise emblazoned with icons of buffaloes, photos of beloved Buffalo landmarks like the Peace Bridge and the gone-but-not-forgotten H-O Oats grain elevator, and catchy slogans all the locals can recite by heart (in fact, one of Buffalo's most enduring nicknames, the ""City of No Illusions"", originated as a slogan on a New Buffalo Graphics t-shirt), this is the place for you. All the designs are the work of the friendly owner of this longstanding Buffalo institution, Michael Morgulis, whose knowledge of the ins and outs of Buffalo is matched by the enthusiasm of his love for his hometown."
"Named by owner Lisa Samar after her beloved dog, pet supplies for the dog lover is the name of the game at the Hertel Avenue storefront previously home to '''Floral Explorations'''. Daisy's Doghouse is an independently-owned specialty boutique carries a full line of natural, holistic, and often locally-sourced products that are priced competitively with mass-market big-brand items: everything from leashes to shampoos to bowls to organic, filler-free dog foods and treats from brands such as '''Fromm''' and '''Wild Callings'''. All this is available to browse in a brightly-painted, well-lit retail floor that also serves as space for the puppy training classes the store puts on. You can even choose from a range of animal-themed greeting cards."
"Located in the historic Sample Shop building, the Elmwood Yarn Shop serves the needs of Buffalo's hand-knitting and sewing enthusiasts with a wide range of patterns, buttons, sewing kits, books, and other needs. True to its name, though, the pride of this friendly shop's inventory is a dizzying range of yarns, with hand-painted, tweed and novelty selections a specialty, and exotic fibers such as alpaca, camel, and angora available. The yarns here tend toward the high-end and are priced accordingly, though bargain hunters will be pleased with the selection in the sale bins. All this curated by a staff that earns rave reviews for the helpful and informative service they provide to, and the friendly rapport they have with, their loyal customers."
"Now in a new location near the west end of the Hertel strip, Kurtlyn Cunningham's ""metaphysical and eclectic shoppe"" is a source for an array of unusual goods that are otherwise impossible to find in the local area. A self-described ""eclectic witch"" interested in spirituality from a young age, Cunningham opened Love Light & Magick on New Year's Day 2015 and immediately made a splash, offering ritual items and supplies for a Buffalo pagan community that is larger than most locals realize. Practitioners of a diverse array of spiritual traditions, from Santería to Wicca to Voodoo to Buddhism to American Indian spirituality and everything in between, are served with a smile. The inventory comprises candles, offering bowls, essential oils, incense resins, tarot cards and boxes, crystal balls, runestones, and altar clothes, all united by a focus on positivity and searching for harmony with the earth — and goods are locally sourced whenever possible. More than that, though, Love Light & Magick is also a place to go for psychic readings, meditation classes, reiki sessions (on Friday and Saturday nights), seminars on spiritual topics, and even art shows. Staff is friendly and helpful, and unlike many small businesses in the local area, Love Light & Magick's long hours are convenient for those who work during the day."
"A testament to the high-quality goods available here is the fact that Shickluna Bikes & Darts has been in business since 1899 — opening only a year after Rick's Cycle Shop in Allentown, the second-oldest independent shop of this kind in the U.S. Some of the best bikes in existence today — especially Giant brand bikes, of which Shickluna is a licensed dealer — are displayed for sale in the ample showroom, with models available for everyone from families and everyday cyclists, to enthusiasts of mountain and off-road biking, to professional racers. All bikes are assembled onsite by a professional bike mechanic and come with a year of free adjustments and flat-tire repair. Shickluna also doubles as Buffalo's premier dart shop, with soft- and steel-tip darts and boards by such brands as Dart World and Harrows. Customer service at Shickluna can be indifferent, but the products sold here are of the highest quality and the prices can't be beat."
"The centuries-old tradition of Iroquois herbal medicine is the name of the game at this new Hertel Avenue shop owned by Mark Okwahotekakahrake Jamieson (""Eyes of the Wolf""), a full-blooded Mohawk who is learned in the old traditions and keen on passing them down to the next generation of Natives as well as Buffalonians in general. At Six Nations Herbal Remedies, there's seemingly a plant, root, flower, or tea for every malady — and if you can't find one for what ails you, just ask Mark and he'll put in an order. The store's decor is minimalist and all business, with monochrome walls lined with row after row of jarred herbs as well as jewelry, artwork, musical instruments, dreamcatchers, and other crafts handmade by local Amerindian artisans — all watched over by a large stuffed bear, the keeper of herbal medicine according to Iroquois tradition. Six Nations also plays host to educational workshops regarding Iroquois culture and spirituality, with an emphasis, naturally, on traditional medicine (and free tea usually available!)"
"The Virgil Avenue Tobacconist's slogan proudly declares it to be ""where the city smokes"", and if local renown is a measure of quality, that's hardly an exaggeration. This one-stop shop just off Hertel offers everything the Buffalo smoking enthusiast could conceivably desire: imported cigarettes, pipes and pipe tobacco, rolling papers, loose cigarette tobacco, and — the main draw — a dizzying range of premium cigars shipped directly from factory to store. Ashton, Hemmingway, Arturo Fuentes, and Cohiba are only a few of the many brands to be found in Virgil Avenue's massive walk-in humidor. Also part of the package is the Rocky Patel Lounge, a cigar lounge with a large-screen HDTV, beverages including a complimentary coffee bar, and club-style seating for up to 20 people."
"Opened in July 2016 on Kenmore Avenue just a door down from the corner of Delaware, this men's and women's urban clothing boutique is owned by Joshua Barnes, a hardworking, ambitious aspiring rapper with a passion for helping the local African-American community achieve prosperity through entrepreneurship. Aside from the streetwise fashions he stocks at Buffalo's Own — t-shirts, ladies' tops, the latest in Nike and other name-brand sneakers, jeans, skirts, handbags and other accessories — Barnes also plans to open an on-site recording studio for local hip-hop and R&B artists."
"If you've followed your GPS from Hertel onto Botsford Place, you might think you've taken a wrong turn — Flying Anvil Metalworks is located in an anonymous brick industrial building in West Hertel, surrounded by warehouses and big-rig parking lots. But appearances can be deceiving: inside, you'll find a bevy of unique, custom-made furniture, collectibles, architectural and interior elements, and ''objets d'art'' fashioned by owners Mollie Atkinson and Kenny Kash out of steel, copper, brass and aluminum. They'll work with you to fashion your own metal-art masterpiece whether it be functional or strictly decorative, or you can browse their ample selection of antique and collectible metal art made by others. Flying Anvil even does double duty as an exhibit space where local metal artists display their works."
"The much-ballyhooed Queen City Wine & Liquor may have only opened in August 2014, but it has already earned rave reviews for the great variety of wine and spirits that fill the shelves of its ample, warehouse-like interior — ranging from the basics to delightful oddballs like handmade, gluten-free craft vodka — at prices that are among the best in town. As well, the staff here keeps their ear to the ground and eagerly accepts suggestions from their growing customer base for new vintages and liquors to stock. Aside from that, you'll be struck by how unintimidating Queen City Wine & Liquor is: unlike some other liquor stores, this place is clean, airy and well-lit, and the staff is as friendly and helpful as can be."
"Scime's Sausage is an old-style meat market that's been sating hungry Buffalonians practically forever. Though a full range of meats is on offer at their butcher's counter, the specialty here is the homemade Italian sausage that owner Salvatore ""Sam"" Scime crafts daily from high-quality, specially-purchased pork shoulders, to which is added a blend of herbs, spices and flavorings including black pepper, fennel seed, fresh parsley and Romano cheese. As well, a range of Italian groceries is offered at Scime's that includes imported cheeses, olives, produce, pasta, and fresh, locally-baked Luigi's bread."
"Buffalo LUV relocated in 2015 from its original digs in Allentown to off-the-beaten-path West Hertel, but other than that the story remains the same. The marquee item here is glass pipes and other ""functional art glass"" blown before your eyes by master artisan Matthew Lazzaro, but that's really only the beginning of the story: there's glass sculptures, custom-made Christmas ornaments, and a variety of other glassware produced in-house by ""Lazz"" or elsewhere in the local area by other Buffalo-based artists, as well as antiques aplenty. These are some high-quality pieces crowding the shelves on the sales floor; the offerings trend heavily toward early- and mid-20th-century handpainted furniture and quirky decorative tchotchkes. A variety of locally-made artisan jewelry by '''WNY Body Expressions''' rounds out the multifaceted offerings."
"A family-owned and operated Delaware Avenue mainstay since 1951, Delaware Camera is the dream come true of photo buffs from beginners to experts: this full-service camera store boasts a complete range of supplies for film, slide, and digital photographers, sold by a caring and knowledgeable staff who treat customers like family. The state of technology being what it is, Delaware Camera's specialty is digital photography, with top-of-the-line cameras and camcorders representing many major brands (a notable exception is Canon), as well as lenses, UV filters, flash mechanisms, tripods, camera cases, memory cards, and more. For old-schoolers, Delaware Camera also stocks a full range of film, slides and photo paper, and contains an on-site photo lab for developing prints. As well, the seasoned staff of Delaware Camera are experts at restoring your old photos to their former glory, either as prints or digitally. A 10% discount on paper, film, and photo chemicals is offered to college students."
"At this new University Heights fashion boutique on Main Street next to '''Pamela Inc.''', the name of the game is elegant, high-fashion formalwear including dresses, gowns, accessories and jewelry. Couture Boutique doesn't just sell clothes, though — they also do alterations, with quick service to boot. Needless to say, this is a popular place around prom season."
"Greeks & Sneaks is not only a place for UB students to purchase or rent textbooks (at prices much more reasonable than the on-campus bookstore and sometimes even cheaper than Amazon), but it also doubles as a one-stop shop for all manner of college-themed clothing and gear. Dedicated UB football and basketball fans can find a full range of t-shirts, sweats, hoodies, and other items emblazoned with the Bulls logo. Greeks & Sneaks also offers fraternity and sorority swag, as well as silkscreen prints, embroidery, and a wide range of sneakers."
"O'Connell's is a family-owned and operated clothier whose ambience is redolent of an earlier time in retail, featuring merchandise crafted with pride and skill and sold to the public by helpful salespeople dedicated to building friendly and lasting personal relationships with their customers. High-end men's formalwear is a specialty at O'Connell's; the suits, sportcoats, dress shirts, shoes, slacks, ties and accessories offered here are of a style that is a unique combination of staid conservatism and quirky individuality (witness, for example, cufflinks shaped like race cars and champagne bottles). Free alterations are provided with purchase, and O'Connell's also offers a range of women's wear and items for young men. Prices tend toward the higher-end, but you get what you pay for."
"The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique may be small, but — as hinted at by the impeccable effort put into the fabulous window displays looking out onto Main Street — the selection here is vast, diverse, and constantly changing. The clothing at Pamela Inc. is characterized by fun, sassy fashions with bright colors and a chic urban style, but it's the selection of accessories that really distinguishes this place: handbags, belts, jewelry, scarves and sunglasses — and above all, what may be the city's best selection of women's hats — all take a prominent place among the merchandise at Pamela Inc. All major credit cards are accepted, as well as PayPal for online orders."
"Iron Crown may play perpetual second banana to its neighbor further up Main Street, Queen City Bookstore, but this smaller, more out-of-the-way comic store makes up for that with its reasonable prices, customer service that is arguably even more friendly and personable than Queen City's, and — above all — a full range of supplies for players of Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and other card games. Iron Crown also sells a variety of toys and collectibles."
"Calling themselves the ""King of Comics"", Queen City Bookstore is beyond a shadow of a doubt Buffalo's best-known and best-loved comic book store. Customers love the wide selection of comics available at Queen City, including traditional superhero titles, gritty graphic novels, quirky independent comics, kids' comics, and a dizzying array of back issues for completist collectors. This vast library, along with a diverse inventory of figurines, toys, collectibles, and comic collectors' supplies such as plastic sleeves and boards, is curated by a friendly staff headed by the legendary Emil Novak, who is well-known not only for providing knowledgeable, supremely helpful, and personal service to longtime regulars and newbies alike, but also for his involvement in local low-budget horror cinema and arranging comic conventions and other events around Buffalo. All titles are 20% off on Sundays and come with a free bag and board."
"In business since 1971, Talking Leaves Books is Buffalo's oldest independent bookstore. To quote from the store's website, the name Talking Leaves ""derives from a recurrent conceptualization of books by peoples who were unfamiliar with print; book pages were seen as 'leaves' that 'talked,' imparting wisdom and knowledge and spirit... an intriguing way of keeping track of the treasures of the people: their minds and their ways of being in, and understanding, the world."" True to that philosophy, offered here is a vast selection of the sort of books that expand people's consciousness, with an especial emphasis on unusual and oft-neglected topics. But what Buffalonians love most about Talking Leaves is the staff, who take sincere pleasure in customer service whether it be special-ordering books not currently in stock, making interesting recommendations, or attending to any problems customers may have. Talking Leaves is a true Buffalo gem."
"A Buffalo institution since 1927, the Parkside Candy Company is the oldest and one of the largest locally-owned manufacturers and purveyors of fine candies in the area, distributing its products nationwide (including sponge candy, the local specialty that serves as their signature product). Though Parkside Candy operates five retail stores all over Erie County, the original location in the former '''Henkel Building''' in University Heights is the one that's nearest and dearest to Buffalonians' hearts. Walking into Parkside Candy is like stepping into another time, with a full range of chocolate truffles and cordials, peppermint patties, fudge, old-fashioned lollipops, and specialty items such as chocolate-covered popcorn and pretzels merchandized amid an Art Deco interior with Adamesque flourishes (designed as a conscious imitation of French confectionery stores) and the classic black-and-white checked tile floor. Best of all, Parkside Candy's Main Street location doubles as an old-fashioned ice cream parlor and soda fountain perfect for warm summer days. Gift baskets are available, as well as online orders."
"Record Theatre is one of the only locally-owned record stores remaining in Buffalo today, which some might say is reason enough in itself to stop in. Record Theatre boasts nearly 20,000 square feet of new and previously-owned CDs, DVDs, and vinyl records, with a still-impressive selection especially in terms of hip-hop, R&B, and other urban music genres. Record Theatre will also purchase your used CDs or specially order from their distributors any title that is not in stock. 20% off all merchandise on Saturdays before noon."
"Don't be fooled by the name: Winspear Liquors is actually located at the corner of Lisbon Avenue, not Winspear! That aside, this new store opened in December 2012 and has quickly become the place to go in University Heights for a wide variety of wines and spirits, comprising local, national and international vintages including chilled and sparking varieties. Prices can be a bit high at Winspear Liquors, but the variety is surprising. New York Lottery, Mega Millions, and Powerball tickets are sold as well."
"Opened in May 2015, Mermaid & Weasel is a quirky boutique whose diverse gamut of merchandise revels in nerd culture: this is a place where you can pick up unique gifts from crocheted Cthulhus to Dr. Who-themed socks, as well as lots of locally-themed tchotchkes that are unmistakably Buffalo, yet wholly unlike anything you'd find at '''Spoiled Rotten''' or '''Everything Elmwood'''. ""Caturday"" sees 10% off everything in store whether feline-related or not, and special events of interest to gamers and science buffs are also frequently held. The owners are super friendly, too."
"Since 1946, Militello's has provided travel-happy Buffalonians with a wide variety of high-quality luggage and travel accessories, as well as attaché cases, wallets and key cases, and other fine leather goods sold with a heaping side order of old-fashioned friendly customer service. Buffalo's only dedicated luggage store, Militello's selection fits all budgets and encompasses wheeled suitcases, duffle bags, tote bags and garment covers from renowned brands such as Briggs & Kelly, Travelpro, Eagle Creek and Hartmann. Militello's is also proud to offer comprehensive, experienced repair service for all types of luggage and leatherware. Customer parking is available at the rear of the building."
"Music City is the place to go in University Heights to purchase or rent a wide variety of guitars, bass guitars, drum kits, brass band instruments, and other instruments, as well as amps, PA systems, effects pedals, and sheet music. The collection is curated by Vincent James Mastrantonio, a locally famous musician who heads up a staff that's famous for their friendly rapport with customers, their encyclopedic knowledge of Music City's products, and the great skill with which services such as tuning, repairs, pickup installations, and even private music lessons are performed. High-quality equipment from leading brands like Rickenbacker, Gretsch, Zildjian, and Marshall is not only sold at great prices, but also optimized for each customer by the same talented staff, with customized inspections and adjustments routinely performed before each sale to ensure that all instruments have the best sound possible. The renown in which Buffalo's community of musicians holds Music City is reflected in its recognition in ''Buffalo Spree'' magazine's annual ""Best of Western New York"" poll in both 2007 and 2008. Music City's staff is also happy to provide fair-market appraisals on a wide variety of instruments."
"It might be a bit misleading to describe New Age Creations as a ""head shop"", exactly — the ambience here is a good deal more ""mainstream"" than a place like '''Terrapin Station''', with an emphasis on quirky gifts rather than tobacco, glass pipes, and the like. Still, New Age Creations is a great place for modern-day flower children to find '60s-themed tchotchkes such as incense, lava lamps, and the like. A variety of tie-dyes and other apparel is also on offer."
"""All Roads Lead to Speaker Shop"", so the slogan goes; the handsome store on Main Street just past the University Plaza that is one of Western New York's foremost destinations for high-end home stereo and theater systems, digital audio systems, headphones, speakers, and all manner of audio, video and media equipment. Customers praise the knowledgeable and pressure-free (if not always friendly) service provided by Speaker Shop's non-commissioned sales staff, who are on hand to direct customers among their slate of state-of-the-art, audiophile-grade products to the choice that's right for them. All the finest brands are represented here. As well, Speaker Shop offers comprehensive custom installation and repair services. Prices tend to be high, but you definitely get what you pay for."
"Located for many years on Kenmore Avenue near the corner of Colvin, the Nickel City Shirt Company offers customized embroidered and screen-printed T-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts, as well as hats, mouse pads, and other goods emblazoned with the design of your choice. ""Quality Work at the Lowest Prices in Town"" is the vow of founder Keith Marzec, and that's no lie — this place is highly regarded among Buffalonians."
"Thankfully, though it moved in 2011 from its longtime location on the corner of Hertel and Saranac, nothing has changed about the homemade sweets and other baked goods with which Gino's Italian Bakery has enchanted Buffalonians for so long. A huge variety of authentic Italian pastries (try the ''pasticiotti'', a perennial favorite among Gino's customers), delectable Italian cookies such as ''cuccidiati'', ''giugiuleni'', and Italian wedding cakes, and pastry platters and full-sized cakes for special occasions are all available here. Fresh, tasty loaves of Italian and French bread baked in-house, as well as what may be the best authentic tomato pie in the city, round out the selections at Gino's. The authenticity of the Italian bakery experience is matched by the prices, which really can't be beat."
"Western New York's oldest and largest store specializing in children's furniture, White's Baby & Teen Furniture was founded in 1939. It's that longevity in business that has enabled the staff here to not only select a wide range of high-quality products for all budgets, but to answer pretty much any question a customer may have about their products, make recommendations, special-order items that may not be in stock, and generally provide service that is among the most exceptional around. White's vast expanse of showroom space spans three floors and is jam-packed with items that cover the whole gamut — baby furniture and cribs, car seats, strollers, playpens, children's beds, dressers and armoires, lamps, and the list goes on. This wide selection is versatile enough to accommodate those on a budget as well as shoppers in search of higher-end items, including quality pieces from such brands as Graco, Stanley, DaVinci, and NaturePedic. White's also carries a modest range of children's clothing and accessories (including satin Christening gowns), bedding, and gifts."
"What's available at Nick's is not the usual array of baseball bats and mitts, tennis rackets, and other such things. Though it dubs itself a ""sporting goods store"", this small, jam-packed North Buffalo storefront might be better described as a surprisingly comprehensive outdoor goods shop, with a full range of gear for hunters, fishermen (including live bait!), and sport shooters. That's all a prelude to the real raison d'être of Nick's, however, as Buffalo's premiere archery store. Not only does this place sell the best state-of-the-art archery gear, but customers can also come to Nick's for free adjustments to their bow, reasonably-priced repairs, and a comprehensive slate of archery lessons and New York State bowhunting education courses — a complete range of supplies and services for the Buffalo archer delivered by a staff that is friendly and knowledgeable. As well, Nick's provides free time on the indoor archery range located in their basement with the purchase of any bow."
"Opened in February 2015 as the first of a glut of new craft distilleries set to open in Buffalo in the ensuing months, Black Squirrel Distillery is the brainchild of Jason Schwinger, otherwise known as the founder of '''BFLO Harbor Kayak''' and part-owner of '''Silo City Rocks!''' on Ganson Street. Black Squirrel is one of a very few producers of rum in New York State, and the only one in the country that uses maple syrup as the main ingredient rather than cane sugar — a peculiarity that was borne of the requirement that New York-based craft distillers source 75% of their ingredients from within the state, though no sugarcane is grown that far north. The end result grafts a subtle yet distinctive maple finish onto the flavor of what is otherwise a rather traditional amber rum. All the rums produced by Black Squirrel are handcrafted in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; distilled in a traditional copper-columned pot still then aged in oak barrels, the old-fashioned way. In the same vein, Black Squirrel also produces an unaged, 90-proof distilled spirit they call ""mapleshine"" — essentially what backwoods distillers would call ""sugar shine"", except with maple syrup in place of sugar. The small retail shop/tasting room is set up in the style of a speakeasy, an homage to Schwinger's great-grandparents who ran one on this very corner during Prohibition."
"Since 1995, owner Wayne Riggs has operated this conveniently located Delaware Avenue liquor store that has scored points with Buffalonians for in terms of customer service — the staff at Great Arrow Wine and Liquor is not only warm and friendly, but supremely helpful and knowledgeable, able to answer any question their customers may have or suggest the perfect product for their needs. Manager Randy Kozlowski, in particular, is the man to see for anyone who has questions about food pairings. The selection here is a dizzying range of both domestic and imported wines, as well as an equally wide variety of vodka, rum, whiskey, gin, tequila, brandy, and cremes and liqueurs (the selection of the latter, in particular, is perhaps the best in Buffalo), at prices that are reasonable though not dirt-cheap. Wine tastings occur at Great Arrow every Friday, and Thursdays feature a ""create your own wine 6-pack"" option, where customers can make a selection of six of any of the wines in stock for a 15% discount."
"Carriage Trade Pastries is a charming little bakery founded in 1998 by Shandra and Andy Beutner and situated on Elmwood Avenue in the shadow of the old '''Pierce-Arrow factory'''. The staff here is not only uncommonly skilled in designing and baking some of the best cakes and pastries in Buffalo, but utterly friendly and accommodating to their customers' individual needs. In addition to supplying desserts to some of the finest restaurants in the Buffalo area, Carriage Trade's retail store is a great place to pick up delicious pastry items made from scratch, such as cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, muffins, sticky buns, scones, and more, all at prices that are surprisingly affordable given their quality. Pies, cakes and other specialty items are available too, but as this is a small operation that custom-designs all their cakes, these must be ordered at least a day in advance. A lunch counter is also present where a few light items such as soups, meatless chili, and quiche are on offer."
"This small, friendly neighborhood jewelry store has been on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street since 2003. Gatti Jewelers' selection of bracelets, necklaces, earrings, watches, and other pieces is curated by an owner whose knowledge of gold and silver jewelry is encyclopedic. As well, Gatti does an impressive side business dealing in used musical instruments as well as accessories such as amplifiers. Estate sales are also handled."
"Located on up-and-coming Main Street in the Vernon Triangle in a spacious, newly-remodeled storefront that was once home to the fabled '''Stuffed Mushroom''' restaurant, International Wine & Spirits stocks a selection of award-winning wines from the local region and around the world, as well as premium branded liquors such as whiskey, brandy, cognac, tequila and rum. Local connoisseurs love the quality of products available here for very reasonable prices — this place is well-known for taking full advantage of manufacturers' rebates from their distributors — but what's most notable about International Wine & Spirits is the breadth and diversity of their inventory. Service with a smile is the rule here, and International Wine & Spirits also hosts occasional wine tastings and other events."
"It's doubtful that a traveler would come to Buffalo specifically to avail themselves of the thing that is this company's primary raison d'être — tuning, rebuilding, and restoring pianos — but dedicated musicians might be interested in knowing that Illos also sells a wide variety of new and high-quality used pianos from such brands as Yamaha, Steinway, Firth & Hall, and Goulding, as well as harpsichords and player pianos, and can arrange to have them transported from their shop on Main Street in Central Park to anywhere in the United States. If not, Illos also sells a full line of beautiful, 36-inch hardwood piano benches in a variety of finishes, accessories such as piano covers and wheel and tripod casters, and — best of all — a ''huge'' selection of sheet music. Illos has been in business since 1961, and their reputation is such that they have sold or restored pianos for clients as prestigious as the Chautauqua Institution and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, as well as dozens and dozens of Western New York high schools and colleges."
"Bertha's, which according to its slogan is ""the diner that takes you back a few years"", is a '50s-style affair that's located right next door to the North Park Theater. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and till 8PM on Fridays, Bertha's serves standard diner fare at unbeatable prices. The lunch menu is dominated by standard fare — burgers (monikers of selections such as the ""James Dean"", the ""Davey Crockett"", and the ""Buddy Holly"" continue in the '50s theme), club sandwiches, and similar items, as well as salads, wraps, and simple entrees. Full breakfasts comprise delicious omelettes, egg sandwiches, buttermilk pancakes and ""Buffalo's best Belgian waffle"", and weekly specials are offered. Cash only."
"Bucking the trend on Hertel (and all over Buffalo) toward ever more creative and upscale dining, the menu at Block's — which opened its doors in October 2015 at the former home of '''Allegro''' in the old '''Sample Building''' — is a good sight more down-to-earth than its predecessor. The name of the game here is classic pub grub and good old-fashioned American comfort food, but please don't confuse the small size and simplicity of the menu with indifference to quality: this place does what it does with panache. At lunchtime, chef-owner Michael Rottger cooks up a mean reuben, crispy and piled high with corned beef and fixin's, as well as an out-of-this-world French onion soup and a slate of burgers that's the one section of the menu where creativity reigns supreme (the ever-changing Burger of the Day would do Bob Belcher proud), while the ""California chicken"" platter (grilled with avocado and tomato and smothered with melted provolone) is the most popular of the somewhat smaller range of full-size dinners served Thursday through Saturday. Service is unfailingly professional and attentive, and if it's a nice day why not enjoy your meal on Block's breezy sidewalk patio?"
"A newly remodeled dining area boasting several high-definition flat-screen TVs which are inevitably tuned to the big game (this place is understandably popular during Bills and Sabres seasons) is the setting where patrons of Bob & John's La Hacienda enjoy simple yet delicious items such as subs, wraps, burritos, a small selection of salads, pizza, and stromboli. A particular specialty at Bob & John's is the chicken wings, which come in a wide variety of delicious sauces including classic Buffalo, barbeque, Cajun, and Jamaican jerk (boneless ""wingdings"" are also available). A modest range of simple entrees, comprising mostly pasta dishes as well as a locally renowned fish fry that's available on Fridays, is also on offer; at lunchtime, a buffet is offered featuring pizza, soup and salad."
"At the former home of '''Sister's African Cuisine''', an interesting but ultimately failed experiment in acquainting Buffalonians with Liberian food has given way to one of the best breakfast joints on Hertel. The aptly named Café on the Avenue hops during the morning hours with a full menu of breakfast sandwiches and burritos (huge!), omelets, pancakes, French toast, and egg-and-breakfast meat platters, but the flagship item here is homemade donuts, prepared by what is proudly cited as ""the first Donut Robot in the Buffalo area"" and available in quite a few more varieties than you'll find at your average Tim Hortons or Dunkin' Donuts. At lunchtime, the slate of options transitions into classic American diner fare: no surprises on the menu, but everything's reliably good. Service can be hit-or-miss, but the price is right, plus the ambience is a solid improvement over the old days of Sister's: the reconfigured interior is spacious and airy, and the kitchen is open, with all the food prepared freshly before your eyes."
"Owned for over 30 years by the Mora family, Gramma Mora's has been a mainstay of Hertel Avenue since it moved here in 1996. Despite the legions of Buffalonians — including reviewers for ''Buffalo Spree'' and ''Artvoice'' — who sing the praises of this place's pleasantly mediocre Tex-Mex fare, it is undeniable that Gramma Mora's has been going steadily downhill for the past ten years or so. Still, the food is far from bad, and even by Buffalo standards, the portion sizes are very generous for the price."
"House of Hummus launched in the summer of 2016 in the former home of like-minded establishment '''Manakeesh & More''', and quickly took a place near the top of the echelon of the Middle Eastern restaurants and specialty grocers that have clustered around the west end of the Hertel strip. This family-owned eatery is headed by Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties, and the keys to House of Hummus' greatness are time-tested old-world cooking techniques and flavors that are intricate, well-balanced, and above all, authentic. The menu is not the most extensive in the world, but it covers all the bases: the twin centerpieces are the titular chickpea dip (large platters come topped with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and — optionally — shawarma meat) as well as what the owner describes as ""Western New York's fluffiest falafel"" (the fluffiness is due to the absence of pine nuts, and the indelible aroma of fresh parsley elevates it a cut above what you can get elsewhere in Buffalo). For main courses, chicken and beef shawarma is the most popular item on the menu, marinated overnight in a mix of red wine, vinegar, olive oil, and a secret blend of spices and topped in a delicious house-special sauce; gyro, shish kebabs, and a variety of salads are also on offer. As you might imagine, vegetarians and vegans will find an uncommonly ample range of choices, and if you're not in the mood for Middle Eastern food, they also make a mean Philly cheesesteak. Portions are generous, service is attentive and brimming with old-fashioned friendliness, and the restaurant itself is clean but small, with only a few tables in the dining room (thankfully, take-out and delivery are offered)."
"Joe's Deli is the brainchild of Joseph Lyons, and is located in the handsome brick storefront on the corner of Hertel and Colvin that was formerly home to '''Mastman's Kosher Deli''', a longstanding, iconic linchpin of the formerly burgeoning Jewish community in North Buffalo (the old Mastman's sign is still perched above the corner entrance). Though the business hasn't stayed completely true to its predecessor — this food isn't Kosher, and traditional Jewish sandwiches such as corned beef, pastrami, and Reuben are joined on the menu by a range of other sandwiches such as muffaletta, Cuban, and a concoction of grilled vegetables and herb cream cheese on a hoagie roll dubbed the Johnny Be Good — the emphasis on freshness and flavor at Joe's has inspired many locals to name it as the purveyor of the best deli sandwiches in Buffalo. Most interesting of all, however, are the wraps, whose variety is truly striking: a Thai chicken wrap, a Greek wrap consisting of feta cheese, olives, and fresh vegetables in Greek dressing, and a hummus wrap are among the offerings."
"A small family-run restaurant with a modest menu, La Kueva nonetheless made a big splash in May 2013 when it became the latest in a long list of multiethnic eateries to chip away at the official designation of Hertel Avenue as Buffalo ""Little Italy"". Owner Luis Martinez's desire was to bring the subtle, delightful flavors of Puerto Rican cuisine out of the barrio and into the larger Buffalo restaurant scene; in a recent write-up on buffalo.com, he remarked: ""My people... already know about [Puerto Rican] food. I want to attract the Italians, the white people of North Buffalo and introduce them"" to it. La Kueva is already receiving rave reviews from Buffalonians for its take on Hispano-Caribbean favorites like pollo guisado, pastelones, and various tropical drinks, but for less adventurous diners, a range of sandwiches is available as well."
"Lone Star Fajita Grill has been a North Buffalo institution for what seems like forever. Simple but excellent Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes at prices that can't be beat (nothing on the menu costs more than $3!) are served up at this sparsely decorated dive at the east end of the Hertel Avenue strip. Cash only."
"A simply magnificent place to eat. Buffalo's first Iraqi restaurant, Shish Kabab Express serves all the standards of Middle Eastern cuisine — shawarma, falafel, tabbouleh — as well as unusual specialties unique to the cuisine of Iraq, such as quzi and Iraqi-style kebabs. As well, Shish Kabab Express stands out among the crowd of similar places at the west end of Hertel by offering a small range of South Asian specialties such as beef and chicken tikka. The food here is fresh and authentic, with 100% halal meat, and all the bread served at Shish Kabab Express (including the samoon, a staple of Iraqi cuisine) is baked fresh on the premises. The kicker is the prices, which, according to one reviewer, are often ""cheaper than a fast-food combo meal""."
"Striking a blow for the continuing Italian-ness of Little Italy — which is being gradually eroded by the diversification of dining options on Hertel — is Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip. Belsito's website loudly trumpets their ""unique foods made from Italian cured meats and cheeses"", which is an accurate description of its modest-sized, decidedly ""lunchy"" menu. A range of appetizer salads and cheese-and-cold-cut plates are on offer, the latter of which are served with fresh homemade bread and side salads, but the bulk of the menu consists of a mouth-watering selection of sandwiches and panini featuring various combinations of imported Italian charcuterie and cheeses of impeccable quality. Call the menu a one-trick pony if you want, but Belsito sticks to what it does well and earns raves from local foodies as a result. To drink is a dazzling selection of imported Italian wines, reputedly the best in the city, but the equally expansive beer list includes only a few imports — it's given over mostly to craft beers from regional microbrewers such as '''Southern Tier''', '''Ellicottville''', the '''Brooklyn Brewery''', and Buffalo's own '''Flying Bison''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. Best of all, Belsito is far less crowded than it ought to be, which makes for excellent service and ample opportunities to chat up the friendly, ever-present owners."
"Situated at the heart of the Hertel strip at the former location of '''La Dolce Vita''', CRāVing is a brand-new restaurant operated by Jennifer and Adam Goetz. Fans of the Goetz's former restaurant, Allentown's sadly missed '''Sample''', will feel right at home here, with a creative menu whose accent, appropriately enough for ""Little Italy"", is on fresh and creative interpretations of Italian cuisine, including delicious homemade pizza. That's not to say that Italian food is CRāVing's sole focus by any means — selections here are as diverse as the German-inspired entrée of pork belly with mustard caviar and rye spätzle, and appetizers such as lobster poutine (!) and buttermilk-fried chicken with grits and sautéed collard greens. Lunch is a more easygoing affair, with a huge sandwich board hanging proudly on the wall."
"Given that Jewel of India is run by the same people who own '''India Gate''' on Elmwood Avenue and '''Taste of India''' in Amherst, patrons of this brand-new addition to the Hertel Avenue strip can expect the same healthy, high-quality fare here as at those other fine establishments. Jewel of India boasts an extensive menu featuring beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and vegetarian entrees; diners enjoy their meal in a lovely, spacious, and impeccably decorated dining room. Lunch and dinner buffets are also available."
"Of Buffalo's many, many Greek diners and family restaurants, Kostas has one of the most interesting and extensive menus. Since 1977, Kostas Family Restaurant has been serving familiar standbys such as souvlaki, gyro, and Greek salad, as well as harder-to-find Greek specialties such as ''tirokafteri'' and ''taramosalata''. Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and other such fare is also on offer, as is a modest selection of wines."
"""Tavola"" in Italian means ""table"", and as the owners of La Tavola Trattoria like to say, ""there's always something good on the table"". The storefront at 1458 Hertel didn't miss a beat after the closure of longtime neighborhood fixture the '''North End Trattoria''' in late 2012, with its new owners setting up shop here not long afterward. La Tavola differentiates itself from the myriad other Italian restaurants on Hertel with a Creole-fusion style that owners Victor Cali and Pat Gentile refer to as ""New Orleans Italian"", with entrées such as shrimp, sausage and chicken in Cajun cream sauce over homemade pasta combining several meats and diverse flavors for a result that's often bolder and spicier than traditional Italian fare. The pride of La Tavola, their expensive 100% wood-fired pizza oven, turns out not only delicious homemade pizzas (which tend more toward the traditional Italian side of the spectrum, perhaps more so than any other place in Buffalo) but also other specialties such as stuffed peppers. Sandwiches and burgers are also available in an ambience that is airy, modern, and impeccably decorated."
"Lloyd's rise to the top of the Buffalo food truck heap was so meteoric that it was perhaps inevitable that they'd follow it up with a brick-and-mortar restaurant: in the five years before this über-popular Hertel Avenue spot's 2015 opening, Lloyd went from launching a struggling operation serving a citizenry who barely knew what food trucks were and where their legal status was uncertain, to a local culinary institution in a town where '''Mighty Taco''' long ruled the roost when it came to Mexican food. The ""high-end food and service at street-level prices"" credo under which Lloyd's trucks operate applies equally to the Taco Factory: the menu combines a curated selection of the most popular options from the truck (now if you want your fix of Tricked Out Nachos or the ""Dirty South"" dessert burrito, you know exactly where to find it on any given day) with some interesting new creations (the ""El Hombre"" quesadilla is probably the most popular of these, with chorizo lending a smoky aroma to a cheese-based filling that also includes potato, onion, and avocado crema, while the ""Mexicali Spring Rolls"" sees Lloyd dabbling in Asian fusion, stuffed with a cheese and mushroom mixture spiced up ever-so-slightly with charred poblano pepper with two different sauces for dipping). No matter what you order, you can be sure that it's done up right: everything is made with free-range, antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and locally grown produce and served on house-made corn tortillas made through the traditional ''nixtamalization'' process, the only restaurant between Chicago and New York City that does this. There's also a full cocktail bar with the best selection of mezcal in town, plus a wealth of specialty cocktails that are a bit pricey but worth it. It bears emphasizing that this is one of the most popular new restaurants in Buffalo — waits of over two hours for tables are not uncommon at peak days and times, and reservations aren't accepted, so maybe save Lloyd for when you're hungry outside of normal lunch or dinner hours."
"Bucking the trend toward the upscale that Hertel's dining scene (and that of Buffalo as a whole) has seen lately, this new spot in the former '''Empire Grill''' is unpretentious and unabashedly party-oriented — with loud, thumping Top 40 music on the stereo, a huge oval bar ringed with big-screen TVs, and a menu consisting of largely of familiar pub grub with some local twists. At Mac's, you can indulge in some pretty well-executed burgers and hot sandwiches, chicken wings that tend to be a bit spicier than normal, and a range of ""Trash Plates"" — their Buffalo-ified version of Rochester-style garbage plates, with '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters taking the place of '''Zweigle's''' white hots, and '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard taking the place of the regular yellow stuff. If you're a bit hungrier, there's also a small selection of full-size mains that bring out a more refined touch: various steaks and chops including a chicken-fried Delmonico, fish and chicken dishes, and a Thai noodle bowl with your choice of meat. Mac's is a pretty huge place — with two floors of seating, you can take your pick of a view of Hertel Avenue out the picture windows at street level, a bird's-eye perspective of the revelry below on the upper balcony, and a pleasant second-floor patio that rivals the '''Pearl Street Brewery''''s in size and provides a welcome respite from the thundering din inside — and the impeccable service is more befitting a luxurious black-tie restaurant."
"Opened in April 2012 with a name that echoes the slogan of FC Barcelona, Més Que is the first establishment of its kind in Buffalo: a sports bar and restaurant dedicated entirely to soccer. The owners of Més Que, whose other businesses around town include the longstanding West Side fine dining destination '''Left Bank''', have been fans of Buffalo's NPSL club since its foundation, and the state of affairs at this official soccer bar of FC Buffalo is lively and crowded — never more than during one of the soccer matches shown frequently on the flat-screen TVs behind the bar. You'll swear you were in Europe. The menu is small in size but outstanding in quality, with elegant pizzas, panini, pasta dishes, cheese and charcuterie plates, and heartier entrees that represent the cuisine of the Mediterranean, and Spain in particular. Even more impressive are the offerings at the bar, with a wine list of impressive size and a beer selection that draws heavily on imports and local and regional microbrews."
"In 2014, when Frank and Sara Testa were finally ready to strike out on their own after years spent working their way up the rungs of the Buffalo restaurant scene, they happened upon the Hertel Avenue storefront most recently occupied by the short-lived '''Canvas @ 1206''', and the Public House of Buffalo was born (just in time for the Italian Festival that year!) They really did a spectacular job remodeling the place, installing a bar whose top is made from wood salvaged from wharf piers that were excavated during the construction of '''Canalside''' and hanging works by local artists on the wall for a finished product that's cozy yet airy, classy yet unmistakably pub-like. What's served at the Public House of Buffalo is, first and foremost, a huge selection of beer, available on draft as well as in cans and bottles — microbrews dominate some 80 entries on the beer list, including locally-produced craft beers from '''Flying Bison''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. If you're overwhelmed by all the choices, never fear: the bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable about their stock, and will be more than happy to point you in the right direction. As for the food, they describe it as ""elevated pub fare"" — classic bar food kicked up a notch with creative gourmet twists. For example, chicken fingers come milanese style and are served with a side of pesto aioli — and what would a Western New York bar be without chicken wings, tossed in barbeque or classic Buffalo sauce as well as options like Sriracha sesame sauce or '''Chiavetta's''' marinade. Owner Frank's roots as a Chautauqua County farm boy come out in his emphasis on locally-sourced farm-to-table produce, so if you're in the mood for a salad, expect to see seasonal ingredients and enjoy farm-fresh flavors."
"The owners of Romeo and Juliet's are a family of first-generation immigrants who have many years of experience working in genuine Italian bakeries and kitchens, and with this charming restaurant that's been open on Hertel since 1998, they've recreated that experience to the delight of Buffalonians who flock here to enjoy light Italian fare such as pizza, panini and simple entrees, and a range of fresh, flavorful appetizers. The menu is filled out with such delightful selections as a wide and interesting gamut of salads and bruschettas and a small range of pasta dishes; the panini are especially good, a slate of delectable and creative options whose names, appropriately enough, are tributes to some of the great painters of Europe (check out the Picasso, described on the menu as ""an artwork of prosciutto crudo, soppressata, capicolla, salami and mozzarella""). Also, don't forget to visit the bakery, where cannoli, gelato, tiramisu, and other marvelously prepared Italian pastries and desserts are sold."
"The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' was reborn in July 2015 under new ownership — namely Kevin Brinkworth, also known as one of the duo behind Elmwood Avenue's ever-popular '''Blue Monk''' — and there are more than a few cues taken from the Blue Monk experience at this brand-new North Buffalo destination. For instance, the popular duck fries appetizer — hand-cut French fries cooked in duck fat — was imported lock, stock and barrel from Elmwood, and the several dozen local and regional craft beers available on tap and in bottles mines much the same territory as well. However, by and large the focus on the menu here is not the Belgian and Northern French gastropub fare that's Blue Monk's stock in trade, but rather an eclectic selection of homemade, gourmet sausages. Featured sausage selections at The Sterling change periodically, but typically include such offbeat, exotic ""rare game"" blends as wild boar with cranberry and red wine, smoked bison with Burgundy and thyme, and duck with foie gras and Sauterne wine. Elsewhere on the small but impressive menu is a slate of combo platters of locally-produced, somewhat less hoity-toity (but still delicious) '''Wardynski's''' sausages with various toppings and sides, a selection of mac & cheese mains with a variety of toppings, and familiar yet well-executed pub grub such as wings, sandwiches, and burgers, the latter of which are especially accoladed. Perhaps most impressive of all, though, are the renovations that have been done here: far from the dank dive it used to be, The Sterling of today boasts a fully redone interior decorated with a copious collection of antique ""breweriana"" and mementos from the Brinkworth family's nearly century-long tenure in the local restaurant industry — check out the 1901 Ludwig & Company piano that was originally commissioned for the Pan-American Exhibition, and the circa-1890 back bar that the owner purchased from the hosts of the A&E television series ''American Pickers''."
"At the center of the action on Hertel Avenue, Ristorante Lombardo calls their food ""the best Italian in Buffalo"", a claim that is hard to refute given the extensive menu of elegant and authentic Italian dishes served to patrons in a setting that is among the most exquisite and upscale on Hertel. Ristorante Lombardo boasts a full bar and patio and an expansive wine list."
"The Globe Market is a delightful combination café and specialty food shop that is committed to offering a wide range of fresh, locally sourced products. An eclectic variety of gourmet salads, soups and sandwiches are made from scratch daily. Personalized gift baskets are also sold at the Globe Market."
"What was once a dream in the mind of Buffalo locavore Patricia DiFrancesco Banning has now come to fruition: the North Buffalo Farmers' Market kicked off in 2014 with an impressive range of organic fruits and vegetables, breads and baked goods, artisanal pasta, coffee, organic honey, fresh-squeezed juices and delicious smoothies, and even bath and body products — all grown or manufactured locally. This is a true community partnership, with the Hertel-North Buffalo Business Association lending its support and a myriad of local businesses, including North Buffalo's own '''House of Olives''' and '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', turning out weekly to sell their wares. Best of all, you don't have to get up early on a weekend morning to attend — the market runs on Thursday evenings, perfect for folks looking for a healthy and affordable alternative to another restaurant dinner."
"You can take Eric and Andrea Amodeo out of '''Horsefeathers Market''', but apparently you can't take Horsefeathers out of the Amodeos: just a few months after moving to their new joint location on Hertel, the owners of '''The Pasta Peddler''' and '''Blackbird Sweets''' sought to replicate a wintertime institution at their old home on Connecticut Street by welcoming to their ample retail space a small but diverse range of Western New York farmers and artisans, anchored by the Pasta Peddler and Blackbird Sweets themselves, which stay open for business during market times. At the Winter Market on Hertel, you can get everything from locally-raised meat, dairy, eggs and greenhouse produce to jams and jellies, baked goods, bath products, and even gourmet dog treats and hand-crocheted plush toys and accessories — at a time of year when most farmers' markets close up shop. Caffeinated pick-me-ups are also available courtesy of '''Public Coffee'''."
"Hearty, unpretentious Italian meals at a reasonable price are the stock in trade of Frank's Sunny Italy. Though the menu is not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination, familiar Italian standbys such as veal parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, and pizza keep Buffalonians coming back for more. Portions are notoriously massive at this family-style Italian eatery."
"The Kitchen Table moved in July 2014 to a larger location in West Hertel, but otherwise it's the same deal as before: they still serve up classic, unpretentious, all-American comfort food in a downhome atmosphere described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as ""a mix between a greasy spoon and a country kitchen"". Burgers (served with heaping sides of fresh-cut fries that customers rave about), club sandwiches, fish fry, and multitudinous flavors of Turkey Hill ice cream can be had, but the Kitchen Table's true claim to fame is their hearty, homestyle breakfasts, which are served all day. The staff here really goes out of their way to please, and they treat customers like family."
"Linda's is where the West Side meets North Buffalo both literally and figuratively: this humble little storefront in West Hertel does double duty as a place to get not only a variety of healthy and delicious upscale smoothies and protein shakes, but also some of the tastiest and cheapest homestyle Puerto Rican food in town. Let's talk about the latter first: the menu includes not only all the usual suspects like ''bistec encebollado'', ''pernil'' (the specialty of the house), and ''tostones'' (fried crispy and with a flavor that boasts a delightful hint of garlic), but also several harder-to-find specialties you can't get anywhere else in Buffalo, like octopus salad and ''piononos'' (breaded and fried sweet plantains stuffed with a ground beef-and-potato mixture). As for the smoothies, they're carefully constructed concoctions where a large variety of fruits, berries, herbs, and other ingredients carefully chosen for their health properties are mixed, blended, and infused together to delicious results. Best of all, the folks at Linda's are dedicated to the community they call home: when they're not serving their delicious food to diners at the restaurant (for, it should be noted, great prices), they're just as likely to be catering a community event or giving it away for free at a local homeless shelter or food bank."
"This humble establishment operated by Sophia and Sam Ananiadas serves some of the best (and biggest) breakfasts in Buffalo — so good, in fact, that they caught the attention of celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who dedicated a segment of his Food Network series ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" to the place. In addition to the usual lineup of pancakes, omelettes, French toast and the like, the Mediterranean flair of Sophia's cuisine is on full display in the giambotta, their signature breakfast platter of eggs, home fries, homemade Italian sausage, peppers, onions, and garlic. For lunch, an array of burgers, club sandwiches, and salads are on offer, as well as what may be the best souvlaki in Buffalo. Best of all, customers rave about the genuine warmth and friendliness of Sophia's staff that keeps them coming back."
"Though it's located in one of the sterile, monotonous plazas that line Delaware Avenue north of Park Meadow, the Taj Grill lauds itself as ""the finest Indian restaurant in Buffalo"". Though that claim is certainly up for debate — opinions seem to be divided evenly between this place and the Elmwood Village's '''India Gate''' — customers unanimously praise Taj Grill's extensive menu, which boasts a huge selection of all the traditional curries known by lovers of Indian cuisine available with chicken, beef, lamb, seafood, and even tofu and goat, as well as myriad options for vegetarians. The food here caters more to the Indian palette than the Americanized version of the cuisine available elsewhere in the region, to the delight of traditionalists. Best of all is the service, which is unfailingly friendly and upbeat."
"Tokyo II is Buffalo's newest hibachi steakhouse and Japanese restaurant. Steak, seafood, rice, and other entrees are prepared for diners before their eyes on the hibachi in an entertaining spectacle. In addition, a wide range of sushi and sashimi is available, as is other Japanese fare, a small selection of Thai entrees, domestic and imported beers including Kirin, Asahi, and Sapporo, wine, and sake."
"A popular dive where the latest indie tunes can be heard on the soundsystem and people-watchers can enjoy a clientele that trends heavily toward bohemian urbanites and other alternative types (not to mention students of UB's nearby South Campus), Amy's Place is among the hippest eateries on Main Street. By day they serve a range of Lebanese and other Mediterranean fare of respectable quality, including abundant options for vegetarians and vegans. However, Amy's Place is perhaps best known for their substantial, delicious and reasonably priced breakfasts. Cash only."
"This humble take-out (with a few tables for indoor seating) offers what is by far and away, without a doubt, the best Jamaican food in Buffalo. The jerk chicken, rotis, curry goat, and oxtail are all simply fantastic, and are universally served with a side of fried plantains and rice and beans. Wash your food down with a bottle of strong ginger beer. Reggae, calypso, and soca records are also for sale at the counter."
"Amherst's '''Palace of Dosas''' may have flown under the radar of the local restaurant scene, but even so, lots of local aficionados of South Indian cuisine were disappointed when it closed in 2013. They can rest easy: its owner Nick Emmanuel, a Sri Lanka native now in the midst of his third decade in the local restaurant industry, has reemerged at the '''University Plaza''' with the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor. Said menu is comprised of 100% vegetarian fare — one of the few places in the Niagara Frontier that can make that claim — prepared fresh everyday from all-natural ingredients. The place's namesake, and the star of the show, is the ''dosa'': Dosa Place serves about two dozen different variations of this light, airy lentil-based crêpe, either plain with butter or stuffed with various fillings such as onions, potatoes, ''paneer'' cheese, or vegetables, as well as a mix of spices. ''Utthappam'' also make an appearance, the dosa's thicker, doughier cousin that's been described as an ""Indian pizza"", with onions and other ingredients baked right into the crust. Rounding out the menu are a range of spicy vegetable curries, ''naan'' and ''chapati'' breads, and (as appetizers) battered vegetables, ''pakora'', ''iddly'' (fluffy rice- and lentil-based buns with various toppings and spices), and ''vadai'' (savory doughnut-shaped lentil fritters). Best of all, prices are a good sight lower than they were at Palace of Dosas, which themselves weren't too bad."
"In July 2015, when passersby on Main Street started to notice chicken and duck carcasses hung up in the front window where '''Slice of Italy''' used to be, it became clear that a new type of business had arrived in University Heights. Former UB student Eddie Liang opened Eddie's Chophouse in his old stomping grounds near the South Campus because he felt the time was ripe for Buffalonians to sample a new permutation of Chinese food, and what better spot for the big launch than in the thick of the vibrant Asian and Asian-American community gathered around the university? Eddie's is the first restaurant in Buffalo to serve ''siu mei'', or Chinese barbecue — a Cantonese culinary tradition where meat is coated in a seasoning sauce and then slowly rotisseried, bone-in, in a Chinese smoker — and your choices here are pork, duck, chicken, or spare ribs, served either over steamed white rice or as a soup with your choice of macaroni or rice or egg noodles. (If you opt for soup, further ingredients become available: steamed wontons, fish balls, and beef tripe.) A limited range of other selections are also offered, along with a wide selection of hot and cold teas to drink as well as iced mint lemonade, which might be the most popular item Eddie's serves. The pint-sized menu and spartan (if pleasant) interior are made up for by quality and value — the meat served here is fresh and bursting with flavor and comes in huge portions that make the low prices charged that much more spectacular. Eddie's also offers delivery at no charge for orders of $20 or more."
"Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant may not have had its Grand Opening until February 2013, but it's already earning rave reviews among locals. Located just off Main Street in the former '''Fast Frank's''', Kalypso serves up a range of Caribbean specialties that is surprisingly ample given the relative humbleness of its appearance from the outside. Among the usual suspects — jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail — can be found several delectably prepared selections available nowhere else in Buffalo, such as brown stew chicken, Jamaican pepper steak, and escoveitch fish. A small selection of vegetarian options is also offered."
"The Lake Effect Diner is a '50s-style affair located in one of the last remaining ""diner cars"" in America, carefully restored under the direction of local restaurateur Tucker Curtin. With oldies on the jukebox and waitresses dressed in '50s-style pink skirts, the Lake Effect Diner is as authentic as it gets. Decent diner fare — burgers, club sandwiches, french fries, milkshakes and malts — is available here for reasonable prices. The Lake Effect Diner has been featured on Guy Fieri's Food Network television series, ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives""."
"Located in the University Plaza, Venus is a friendly restaurant serving simple Greek and Lebanese foods. By comparison with '''Amy's Place''', University Heights' better-known, longer-standing Mediterranean restaurant, at Venus most of the bohemian ambience is sacrificed, but is made up for with food that, on the whole, is a good deal tastier than the sometimes lackluster fare served at Amy's. Shawarma, falafel, shish kabab and kofta, and gyros are available as either platters or wraps, and delectable Greek salads and fatoush are available for those in search of greener options (tabouli is on the menu as well, but never seems to be available). Though a good deal of the business done here is take-out or delivery, those enjoying their food at one of Venus' handful of tables are treated to a neverending stream of delightfully cheesy Lebanese music videos on the satellite television — a part of the Venus experience that's as integral as the food itself, in this author's opinion."
"Owned since 1981 by the Leung family, and before that for some time in a previous incarnation on Elmwood Avenue, May Jen is the oldest continually operating Chinese restaurant in Buffalo. Though extensive, the menu is not what you would call groundbreaking — the entree of prawns with glazed walnuts, a dish unique to May Jen, is the only eye-catcher in a sea of kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, General Tso chicken, and other standards. But the ambience is serene and pleasant, prices are reasonable, and the quality of the food is high enough for ''Artvoice'' readers to have voted May Jen the Best Chinese Restaurant in several annual ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' polls. Beer and wine are served."
"Make no mistake about Ming Café — from the exterior it may look like just another unassuming hole-in-the-wall in University Heights, but what is served here is high-quality, gourmet Chinese food that is priced accordingly. Ming Café's menu is dominated by interpretations of classic Chinese standards — Szechuan chicken, kung pao shrimp, moo shu pork — that are fresh, flavorful, and prepared to order with an uncommonly refined elegance. The hot and sour soup is particularly good. But it's in the ""signature dishes"" section of the menu where Ming Café's true culinary stars come out to shine — a diverse array of delectable upscale options that can be best described as ""Asian-influenced"" rather than a strict interpretation of Chinese cuisine. The icing on the cake is the huge selection of authentic imported Chinese teas, as well as a variety of coffee. Cash only."
"Opened in fall 2015, the satellite location of Satomi Smith's somewhat eponymous Elmwood Avenue noodle shop is actually a solid improvement on the original, with a considerably expanded selection of noodle bowls and small plates on the menu (they make up for this by not including any sushi or sashimi, as at Elmwood), and a youthful, funky vibe that's much more suited to its college-student clientele than the trendy but staid original location. At Sato 2.0, the three flagship ramen selections of the original restaurant are joined by Buffalo Chicken Ramen (the titular meat with corn, scallions, carrots, and black garlic oil in chicken broth), as well as Kimchi Ramen in a mixed pork and chicken broth. ''Donburi'' bowls and Japanese curry are also offered, but the pièce de résistance on the small plates section of the menu is the huge appetizer of Okonomiyaki Fries — sort of a Japanese take on poutine, smothered in mayo and ''okonomiyaki'' sauce and topped with dried bonito flakes, ''nori'' seaweed, green onions, and pickled ginger. There's a short drink list that prominently features local and regional craft brews as well as a variety of different sake selections, and for dessert there's green tea or ginger ice cream courtesy of Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''."
"Though bouillabaisse, crawfish, po' boys and bananas Foster feature prominently on the menu, it would be a disservice to pigeonhole the lovely bistro run by owner and head chef Jim Guarino as simply a ""Creole"" or ""Southern"" restaurant. Instead, the cuisine offered at Shango is as diverse as it is high-quality. Additionally, the wine list is one of Buffalo's most extensive and has been honored with an award by ''Wine Spectator'' magazine; a carefully selected variety of import beers and microbrews is also available at Shango."
"The Steer is best known for its sometimes rowdy bar frequented by students from the nearby South Campus of the University of Buffalo, but let's not forget that it is also a restaurant that serves pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and — as the name suggests — mouth-watering steaks and chops. The Montana Room, located on the second floor of this unmissable Main Street landmark, is a banquet room equipped for up to 60 guests."
"Those who are expecting Indian cuisine will be disappointed — there's nothing exotic about the menu at Curry's. Rather, the sandwiches, entree salads, meat and pasta dishes served up here match the workmanlike reliability evoked by the humble exterior of this Kenmore Avenue restaurant. What ''is'' special about the heaping portions of classic American comfort food offered up at Curry's is the friendliness with which it's served — this is a real ""where everybody knows your name"" type of place — and its surprising quality, if not creativity. Beer-battered fish fry, a well-known Buffalo specialty, is served with aplomb on Friday nights."
"Opened in 2013, the second location of Yummy Thai has a menu that's identical to the original restaurant in North Tonawanda, but at a much more convenient and centralized location. Here you'll find the usual lineup of Westernized Thai dishes that Stateside fans of the genre are familiar with — ''pad thai''; red, green and ''penang'' curries; ''pad kee mow'' and ''tom yum'' soup for those who like it spicy (unlike many Thai places, Yummy Thai doesn't blandify the food for the American palate; when they say ""spicy"", they mean it!); chicken and beef satay as appetizers. Portions are ample, but the quality of the food is as middle-of-the-road as the selection. If you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat, though, you're not completely out of luck at Yummy Thai, especially if you peruse the house-special stir fry mains. These aren't the most authentic things in the world, but they make up for it with creativity: the ""Peanut King"" features mushroom, bell peppers, baby corn, broccoli, and napa cabbage in a light peanut sauce, and in the ""Healthy Garlic"" the same vegetables are combined with fresh garlic and served in Yummy Thai's special garlic sauce; these along with most entrees are served with your choice of meat, seafood, or tofu for vegetarians. If you're in town on a busy Friday or Saturday night and don't feel like arriving at a restaurant for dinner only to wait an eternity for a table, the perennially uncrowded Yummy Thai may be the place for you, but don't expect that to necessarily translate into fast or attentive service, which is a weak spot here."
"The scion of a family that traces its roots back to Vallelunga, Sicily, John Sinatra opened his eponymous restaurant in 1981, serving family recipes handed down from generation to generation. Originally named '''Sinatra's Trilogy''' in honor of John's three sons who helped him run the business, the name was shortened to ""Sinatra's"" when the middle son, Michael, took ownership after his father's retirement. Though Sinatra's has remained true to its original dedication to delicious Sicilian and Southern Italian food, over the years it has become more known as an upscale destination serving an increasingly refined interpretation of that cuisine. A wide range of pasta dishes are on offer, made with fine ingredients imported from Italy; the pasta con sardi is an interesting choice in this regard, topped with fresh sardines, tomatoes, raisins, fennel and pine nuts. A range of seafood dishes is also available at Sinatra's, as well as chicken and veal served in milanese, marsala, piccata, parmigiana or diavolo style. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the wine list: a gargantuan slate of offerings that features whites, reds and reserve selections from Italy, France and the United States. Buffalonians absolutely rave about this place."
"Opened in July 2014 on the site of the former '''Juicery''', the Delaware Park branch location of '''Ashker's Juice Bar''' (operated in conjunction with Dan McCormick of '''Santora's Pizza''' and the ubiquitous Mark Goldman) has proven to be an instant hit with joggers and bicyclists on '''Meadow Drive''' as well as golfers at the '''Delaware Park Golf Course'''. The Elmwood Village flagship location's menu of juices and smoothies are expanded on with a selection of gourmet sandwiches and salads whose names pay homage to the Buffalo oeuvre of Frederick Law Olmsted, the renowned landscape architect responsible for Delaware Park. For instance, ""The Bidwell"" sees ham, salami and cappicola piled onto a baguette and topped with provolone, roasted red peppers, cornichons, arugula, and homemade vinaigrette, and ""The Cazenovia"" is a classic Greek salad with red onions, tomatoes, feta, and Kalamata olives. As for the juices and smoothies, they're culled from the best and most popular of the offerings at the originbal Ashker's — yes, this includes the Zinger and the basil lemonade — and filtered water is offered free of charge to all. Best of all is the verdant ambience: there are few things in Buffalo more relaxing than sipping on a cold drink on these shady picnic benches, with the panoramic expanse of the Meadow in front of you."
"Vino's is a small restaurant, easily missable and in a fairly out-of-the-way location, with a limited menu and seemingly never open — and Buffalonians can't get enough. They crowd into the place whenever it's open, and many of them call it the best Italian restaurant in the city. Why? Simply put, what is served here is authentic homestyle Italian cuisine that is absolutely delicious and available for unbelievable prices. Entrees emphasize pasta dishes; particular favorites among Vino's regulars are the spaghetti with pesto sauce, lobster ravioli, and the spicy ""Charles diavolo"". Appetizers and desserts are equally lauded, and true to the restaurant's name, a small but delightful selection of wines and sangrias are also on the menu. But perhaps the thing about Vino's that is loved most warmly by locals are the owners, Kathleen and Tony, who truly go the extra mile to ensure that guests are welcomed and attended to with the sincerest regard."
"With Nye Park Tavern, owner Mark Hutchinson — otherwise famous for his somewhat eponymous Delaware Avenue fine dining destination, '''Hutch's''' — takes his signature upscale template and adapts it to pub grub, with a local twist of course. There are no real surprises on the menu, but you'll sure get one when your food comes out: the quality of the ingredients and presentation are head and shoulders above what you'll get at your average Buffalo gin mill (for instance, the ""steak in the grass"" sandwich is a full-size New York strip smothered in fresh-cut, unprocessed provolone), which goes a long way toward justifying the price point. The signature item at Nye Park Tavern, though, are the so-called ""West Side spare ribs"", a smoky concoction inspired by the ones served at the long-gone '''Arkansas Lounge''' off Grant Street. The interior's been spiffed up nicely, too, while retaining the cozy homeyness of '''Papa Jake's''', which preceded it in this location."
"""Fine Dining in the Old-School Tradition"" is Oliver's credo, and true to form, it is one of the most elegant restaurants in Buffalo, with prices to match. With myriad different permutations of Continental cuisine present on the menu, Oliver's is a foodie's dream come true, with veal milanese, strozzapreti, and foie gras torchon among the most popular delicacies on offer. The wine list is, to quote the restaurant's website, ""deeper than deep"". Oliver's also prides itself as one of Buffalo's best caterers."
"Located right across the street from the '''Buffalo Zoo''' and a couple doors down from '''Sweetness 7''', Fairy Cakes Cupcakery is a cute little café that features a fireside lounge and a cupcake bar and that differentiates itself from Buffalo's other cupcake outfits with flavors that are even more creative than its competition (their ""Pancakes and Bacon"" cupcake is topped with maple buttercream and real bacon, and their ""Original Buffalo Hot Wing Cake"" is a seductive marriage of rich chocolate and spicy cayenne pepper), a selection of ""adults only"" cupcakes whose recipes incorporate rum and other alcoholic ingredients, and, interestingly enough, a beverage selection which includes no fewer than 30 varieties of loose-leaf tea. A modest selection of other desserts are available. The consensus on Fairy Cakes is that the cupcakes are not quite as rich and flavorful as Firefly's are, but if nothing else, this place is worth a visit if only to experience the whimsical decor: an almost dollhouse-like setup in cheery pastel colors, you'd expect nothing less from a place named ""Fairy Cakes""!"
"From crêpes and pastries to bangers and mash: at the end of 2015, restaurateur and Buffalo booster extraordinaire Prish Moran shuttered the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''' and replaced it a few months later with what is easily Buffalo's most authentic British pub. The beauty of this place lies in its simplicity and lack of pretense: the menu is on the small side and doesn't try for anything hoity-toity, it's just good solid UK comfort food. P. Moran's serves two kinds of meat pies — chicken and Guinness beef — and while the pies themselves are not quite up to the rarefied standard set by '''Parker's''' in South Buffalo, the ambience here is far better than a prefab warehouse in an industrial neighborhood: the dimly-lit, wood-panelled interior is picture-perfect, and the cozy bar features a good selection of beer (sadly, local craft brews dominate over imported British ales, and there aren't any taps here: bottles only) as well as wine and cider. Elsewhere on the menu you'll find a hearty ploughman's platter big enough to serve at least two, a vegetarian quiche that's a holdover from the old Sweetness 7 menu, cheese and sausage plates, and — for dessert — a delicious, dense figgy pudding ''à la mode'' with caramel sauce. Prices at P. Moran's are quite inexpensive except when it comes to beer and wine, which is another story entirely."
"In the words of ''Buffalo Rising'', ""dinner with a side of nostalgia"" is the order of the day at the Parkside Meadow. Let's talk nostalgia first: this place opened in September 2015 on the site of the similarly named '''Park Meadow''' bar, but those who may be familiar with that longtime neighborhood stalwart can be reassured that they're in for a much more relaxed experience than the rowdy frat-boy hijinks they may remember. Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie had their work cut out for them when they bought the place — it had been vacant since 1991 and had seen better days — but not only did they painstakingly restore the building to its former glory, but they filled the interior with such a vast collection of old-Buffalo postcards, photographs, and artifacts that it may as well be considered a satellite location of the '''Buffalo History Museum'''. As for the food, head chef Stephen Dulanski, fresh off the success of his run at new downtown hotspot '''Toutant''', has created a menu that is informed but not confined by the classic Buffalo pub grub that defines those bygone days, yet has improved on that template with food impeccably crafted using high-quality ingredients. Sandwiches rule the roost at Parkside Meadow: the reuben features tender, rosy corned beef piled high on thick-sliced, griddled-to-perfection rye, with Russian dressing and sauerkraut that add balanced notes without overpowering the flavor of the meat; meanwhile, in the pulled pork sandwich the spicy and peppery barbecue sauce that the meat is cooked in is tempered with cool, crunchy coleslaw. There are some creative touches too: the shaved lamb sandwich comes on toasted sourdough with melted Havarti cheese and spearmint aioli, for example, and the roasted leek and shiitake farfalle with Madeira cream sauce shows that Parkside Meadow can do more than just sandwiches. Service is excellent even when they're busy (which is pretty much all the time), and the downhome neighborhood friendliness of the staff is yet another reminder of olden times."
"Launched for the 2016 season with funding from the Participatory Budgeting Buffalo program, the Main Amherst Fillmore Market sets up shop every Saturday morning and afternoon in the Vernon Triangle, in the parking lot next to '''International Wine & Spirits''', with a mandate of providing an outlet for fresh, healthy, locally-sourced foods in a part of town where the only food shops within walking distance are corner bodegas. In addition to farm fresh vegetables, at MAF you'll also find a small selection of baked goods and other prepared food items, as well as handcrafted jewelry and other baubles."
"Bar, gentlemen's club, cigar bar."
"A ""non-alcoholic bar"" serving soda, energy drinks, juice, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate as well as simple food from the grill. The $4 monthly membership fee entitles you to 25% off drinks."
"""Industrial chic"" is the name of the game at the former '''General Railway Signal Company''' factory, a Nationally Registered Historic Place that's been thoroughly renovated into a mix of offices, apartments and this little boutique hotel. The Foundry Suites has only ten rooms, but they're all beauties: one- or two-bedroom suites custom-decorated in Mid-Century Modern style by the staff of Buffalo's own '''Coo Coo U''', with full-kitchens, floor-to-ceiling windows (the best of which look on to a beautiful tree-lined courtyard with a fountain in the middle), flat-screen HDTVs, and what must be the most luxurious bedding and linens you can find in Buffalo. By day, the ""Foundry Lounge"" downstairs features coffee in a relaxing ambience; by night you can enjoy a rousing game of pool while bartenders whip you up an upscale mixed drink. The Foundry Suites also provides guests with free parking, free concierge service, free passes to '''LA Fitness''', and a 24-hour business center. Also, the location, while it may seem out-of-the-way at first glance, is quite convenient: the boutiques and restaurants of the Elmwood Village and Hertel Avenue, the greenery of Delaware Park, and the cultural attractions of the Museum District are all within easy striking distance."
"Continental breakfast, fax service. All rooms contain coffee maker; suites with kitchens and microwave available on request. Convenient to University at Buffalo South Campus and multiple public transit lines; shuttle to UB North Campus and airport available on request."
"Christopher Lavey, Johnny Mora, and their three dogs operate the Parkside House, one of Buffalo's most charming B&B's, in a restored Queen Anne-style house from the 1890s. Located on the curving, leafy streets of the historic neighborhood of Parkside, within walking distance of Delaware Park, the Buffalo Zoo, and Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural masterpiece, the Darwin D. Martin House, the three units of the Parkside House are large and airy, and boast comfortable yet contemporary furnishings, plasma televisions, and full private baths. Common areas include the dining room, where a sumptuous breakfast is served daily, and a front porch. Wireless Internet access is available throughout the property. Limited off-street parking."
"Opened in 1950 in the wake of World War II, the Buffalo VA Medical Center is affiliated with UB Medical School and provides medical, surgical, mental health, and long-term care services to veterans of the United States military under the aegis of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Buffalo's medical center is the VA system's main place of referral in Upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania for veterans in need of cardiac surgery, cardiology, and comprehensive cancer care."
"Offers dry cleaning services."
"Founded in 1910, Holy Spirit Catholic Church was for many years the site of a shrine to Saint Rita, a pilgrimage site for local faithful who came to venerate her as the ""patron saint of lost and impossible causes""."
"Founded in 1850 as a country church in what was then a rural area, St. Joseph University Parish actually predates by over half a century the UB South Campus, next to which it is located today. With an identity that fundamentally emphasizes the welcoming of visitors and new members to its flock, St. Joseph mirrors the constitution of the University Heights neighborhood as a whole, with a congregation that is surprisingly progressive and diverse given the traditional reputation of Buffalo's Catholic community."
"Serving the Catholics of North Buffalo from its location in the center of the Hertel Avenue strip (its slogan, the ""Heart of North Buffalo"", is an apt one), St. Margaret Church was named after the late sister of former Buffalo bishop Charles Colton, a personal friend of its founding priest, Rev. Thomas Timmons. It remains one of the most active Catholic congregations in the City of Buffalo."
"Parkside's Catholic congregation meets in a robust English Gothic-style church whose bell tower rises 88 feet (27m) above Amherst Street. Linked since 2010 with '''St. Rose of Lima Church''' a short distance to the north, the vitality of parish life at St. Mark is attested to by the activity among the congregation of such organizations as the Boy Scouts, the Legion of Mary, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Visitors are always welcome at this friendly faith community."
"The youngest Catholic congregation in North Buffalo, St. Rose of Lima was founded in 1926, with a school staffed for many years by the Sisters of Charity of Montréal — the famous Grey Nuns. Always an active force in the surrounding neighborhood that grew up alongside it, St. Rose of Lima remains a vibrant congregation that's engaged in the community."
"Headquartered in a lovely English Gothic edifice with exquisitely ornate art-glass windows, Central Park United Methodist Church is considered the cathedral church for Methodism in Buffalo. A diverse and welcoming congregation, Central Park Methodist Church truly lives out its mission of outreach to the community through its mentoring program for at-risk students at nearby '''Bennett High School''', its partnership with the '''Primera Iglesia Metodista Unida''' in service to the Spanish-speaking community of Buffalo's West Side, and its support for worthwhile organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, and Journey's End Refugee Services."
"Founded in 1888 on land donated by Elam Jewett, the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd is a longstanding cornerstone of the Parkside neighborhood. An architectural wonder, this stout Romanesque edifice was designed by the Syracuse-based architectural firm of Silsbee and Marling and boasts several lovely stained-glass windows designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Darwin D. Martin, whose Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house is located kitty-corner from here, was a parishioner in the early days. With the Reverend Catherine Dempesy-Sims at the helm, the Church of the Good Shepherd, like many of Buffalo's Protestant congregations, is a progressive, diverse and accepting faith community (describing itself as ""a place of welcome to all, no exceptions"") which is active in a wide range of charitable and neighborhood-improvement organizations and initiatives."
"North Park Lutheran Church has traditionally been a congregation whose outsize sense of community — both within the congregation and as a component of the larger community — belies its small size. A choice of traditional and contemporary worship services are held by this church whose zeal for sharing their faith and love for the community is really remarkable. Visitors are welcomed with open arms."
"Founded in 1912 as a mission of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church on the Near East Side, the congregation of Parkside Lutheran Church met for several years in the building later known as the '''Fairfield Branch Library''' before the construction of the stately Tudor Gothic stone church in Central Park in which it is currently situated. Today, Parkside's energetic young pastor, Nate Preisinger, leads a progressive and inclusive congregation that is as dedicated to reaching out to the larger community as it is to rolling out the welcome mat to regular parishioners and first-time visitors alike."
"St. Andrew's describes itself aptly as a ""spiritual oasis"", warmly opening its doors to visitors of all stripes. Founded in 1875 as an anomaly — an English-speaking Episcopalian congregation on the East Side, which in those days was largely German and Catholic — St. Andrew's has been a University Heights landmark (and, in fact, a Nationally Registered Historic Place) since the construction half a century later of the elegant Gothic Revival building it currently calls home. St. Andrew's pastor, Ellen Brauza, leads a faith community which is, in the words of the church itself, ""friendly, diverse and inspirational"". Two types of services are held each Sunday: a modern, simplified one bright and early, then traditional ""high church"" later in the morning."
"University Presbyterian Church was founded at an opportune time — almost simultaneous to the purchase of the old Erie County Alms House across the street by the University of Buffalo for use as their new campus. A longstanding neighborhood landmark, University Presbyterian is a gorgeous Colonial-style church building whose 70-foot (21m) bell tower stands sentinel over Main Street. Its identity bears many similarities to that of the college across the street, providing a caring, tolerant, diverse, and intellectually stimulating environment for worship, public service, and loving outreach to university students as well as other members of the community."
"The oldest extant building in North Buffalo — the '''Washington Russell House''' on Main Street in the Vernon Triangle — is now the meeting hall (don't say ""church""; which, according to the website, is a word reserved for the congregation itself) of The Church in Buffalo, a nondenominational, heterogeneous community of Bible-believing born-again Christians who hold one service each on Sundays in English and Mandarin Chinese. Visitors are welcome to those ""Lord's Day meetings"" as well as special weekly functions for young people (Saturdays) and UB students (Wednesdays)."
"Though multiethnic today, the Evangelical Christian Church of Buffalo was founded in 1990 by a motley group of newly landed refugees from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and other regions of the soon-to-be-former Soviet Union, led by pastor Leonid Ostrapovich. Today, Pentecostal services and Sunday school classes for children are held in English and Russian in the former '''Ahavas Achim Lubavitz Synagogue''' on Tacoma Avenue, the church's home since 2002. Visitors, Slavic and otherwise, are welcomed enthusiastically."
"The former Bethel Evangelical Lutheran Church — a handsome English Gothic church erected in 1928 — is now home to this similarly-named, nondenominational congregation headed up by William T. Clark, Jr., who, as Bishop, Apostle, and Senior Pastor, draws from his experience conducting missionary work in countries around the world to lead a diverse, friendly and welcoming congregation that's uncommonly engaged in the community."
"The former home of the '''Parkside Baptist Church''', a stout Romanesque edifice in handsome stone that dates to 1894, is now the home of the Gospel Temple Church of God in Christ. Led by Pastor Willie James Flurence, the Gospel Temple's services, which take place on Sundays at 11:05AM and 6:45PM as well as Friday nights at 7PM, are a mélange of traditional and contemporary styles of ministry and music. Special ministries for children and young adults also take place on a weekly basis."
"Kenmore Avenue in University Heights is where this small but tight-knit community of believers, led by Pastor William H. Smith, has been situated since its foundation in 1994. With services every Sunday at 10:30AM, small-group ministries catering to young people, men, and other specialized sectors of the church population, and extensive community outreach programs, the primary dedication of the North Buffalo Community Church is evangelism. Affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, the North Buffalo Community Church is a friendly congregation that, while primarily African-American in constitution, is multiethnic and welcomes all to its lively services."
"St. George Orthodox Church began its life in 1913 in Black Rock, serving a small enclave of immigrants from Romania, and found strength in 1963 through its merger with a Russian Orthodox congregation whose struggle with small size and declining membership mirrored its own. An affiliate of the Orthodox Church in America, St. George describes itself today as a ""pan-Orthodox"" church that is a syncretic combination of the traditional liturgies of many Eastern faiths. The Rev. Jason Vansuch leads services in their modern building in Park Meadow, immediately adjacent to Delaware Park, where worshipers of all stripes are enthusiastically welcomed."
"Describing its approach as ""a fresh take on traditional Jewish values"", Congregation Achei T'mimim was founded in 1911 as among the first of what would soon be many synagogues serving a thriving Jewish community in North Buffalo — in point of fact, it is the only remaining unaffiliated Orthodox shul in the entire city. Though it is Ashkenazi Orthodox in constitution, Achei T'mimim welcomes Jews of all stripes, regardless of ethnic or denominational differences, to their still-vibrant services which take place Fridays at sundown as well as Saturday mornings at 9:30AM."
"This Orthodox synagogue on Starin Avenue just south of Kenmore Avenue is operated by '''Chabad''', an Orthodox ministry connected with the University of Buffalo. Here two Shabbat services Aare held weekly: the small, intimate Saturday morning services (followed by a hearty lunch!) provide a quieter counterpoint to the busy, lively Friday evening ones. Midweek services are also held."
"Located in Central Park, At-Taqwa is a traditional Sunni mosque, including formal jum'a, with a multicultural congregation and services in English. The building was a private residence before being purchased in the 1970s by the '''Islamic Society of the Niagara Frontier''' and is now a mainstay of the local Muslim community. It's still easily mistakable for an ordinary house, however, and there's no real exterior signage."
"This river is a left branch of the river Neva.  Its length is 6,700 m, its width is up to 70m, and its depth is up to 3,5m. The Fontanka Embankment is lined with the former private residences of Russian nobility. - Until the mid-18th century, the Fontanka River was considered the southern boundary of St. Petersburg. Its banks were lined with the spacious messuages of Russian Imperial Family members and nobility, the most brilliant being the Summer Palace and Anichkov Palace. Here is also the Sheremetev Palace, Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace (Дворец Белосельских-Белозерских), Shuvalov Palace, and the Church of St. Panteleimon. The notable Neoclassical structures from the 18th century include the Catherine Institute (Екатерининский институт), the Anichkov Palace (Аничков дворец) and the Yusupov Palace (Юсуповский дворец). Some of the mansions contain museums. - The Fontanka is spanned by fifteen bridges, including the 18th-century Lomonosov Bridge and the extravagant Egyptian Bridge. The most famous of these, the Anichkov Bridge, carries the Nevsky Prospekt over the river."
"A small river which encircles the central district, effectively making it an island. 4,67km long. - The river flows from the Fontanka River near the Summer Garden past the Field of Mars, crosses Nevsky Avenue and the Kryukov Canal before entering the Neva River. Moika river initially not connected to the Fontanka and stemmed from the swamp on the site of modern Mikhailovsky Garden. When constructing the Summer Garden (Летний сад) in 1704 and later in 1711-1719 was dug Swan Canal (Лебяжья канавка) and sink, than connected to the Fontanka. In 1711 dug a canal from the Red Neva along river Moika to the western border of the Champ de Mars. - Among the magnificent 18th-century edifices lining the Moyka quay are '''Stroganov Palace''', '''Razumovsky Palace''', '''Yusupov Palace''', '''New Holland Arch''', '''Circular Market''', '''St. Michael's Castle''', and the last accommodation and '''museum of Alexander Pushkin'''. - Currently, there are fifteen bridges crossing the Moyka."
"Starts from the Moyka River near the Field of Mars. It flows into the Fontanka River. Its length is 5km, with a width of 32m and there are 21 bridges."
"This is the longest canal in Saint Petersburg, which in the 19th century served as the southern limit of the city. It is 8 km long and flows from the Neva River near Alexander Nevsky Lavra to the Yekaterinhofka not far from the sea port."
"This canal connecting the Fontanka and Admiralty Canal. There are 21 bridges. Sight: Vege House (Доходный дом Веге)"
"1.32km long. Here was a correctional institution, with the St. Nicholas prison church, 1840. - At Decembrists st. corner lived great Russian poet Alexander Blok. - Also on the embankment was Matisov Ordnance Ilina institution (Картографическое заведение Ильина), the first local private enterprise for mapping, founded in 1859. - Former stood seven bridges now stayed only five here."
"Sights: Federal State Admiralty Shipyards (ФГУП «Адмиралтейские Верфи»), formerly Soviet Shipyard No. 194. is one of the oldest and largest shipyards in Russia. - Former home of Y.Vive (дом Я.Вивье). - Bobrinsky Palace (Дворец Бобринских). - Here stood Church of Christ the Saviour, also known as the Savior on the Water (Часовня храма «Спас-на-водах»  until 1932."
"Connecting Bolshaya Neva with Moika River in the vicinity of Winter Palace. The canal was dug in 1718–1719. Its length is only 228m, which makes it one of the shortest canals in the city. The width is about 20m. The granite embankment was built in 1782–84, and railings designed by sculptor I.F.Dunker were added at the same time. The special picturesqueness to the canal is added by the arch connecting Old Hermitage and Hermitage Theater, built by architect Yury Felten next to the Hermitage Bridge. There are three bridges across Winter Canal."
"Connecting the river Neva and Moika between Summer Garden (Summer Garden Island) and the Field of Mars (1st Admiralty Island). - Its length is only 648m. There are two  bridges. - Here was the living house of Betskovo (дом Бецкого), now is Institute of Culture."
"The Hermitage is Saint Petersburg's prime attraction, a massive palace-museum showing the highlights of a collection of over 3 million pieces spanning the globe. Hosted in the Winter Palace, the former main residence of the Russian tsars, and several other historic buildings nearby, the Hermitage is one of the world's great museums, with an imposing setting displaying priceless works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Rubens, Velázquez, Michelangelo, van Dyck, Matisse and many more. It is possible, though not required, to get a tour guide. They can charge as much as $100 but they can tell you more about the building and the items and take you directly to the items you want to see. For many, finding their own way through the opulent interiors, huge and intricate enough to get some people lost, and exploring corners off the beaten path (and the complex is huge enough to have some) may be an attraction in itself. A popular story describes a foreign diplomat insisting to be guided, blindfolded, directly to the Rembrandts, so not to be distracted by the tremendous glittery. Sometimes the museum will limit the admission rate because of the numbers already in the museum. Large bags aren't allowed in the museum; there is a massive cloakroom downstairs for jackets and bags."
"One of the best works of Carlo Rossi. This structure was built in the years 1819-1829, and enclosed Palace Square. The building consists of two blocks, forming a 580-meter arc. There is a triumphal arch, dedicated to the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812, decorated with a sculptural composition in the form of a chariot drawn by six horses. In the chariot is the winged goddess of Fame, holding a standard in his left hand, and a laurel branch in the right. The composition is made by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky."
"Dedicated to the Russian victory over Napoleonic France in the Patriotic War of 1812. This work holds second place, in importance, on the biography of architect Auguste Montferrand, after the construction of St. Isaac's Cathedral. The Angel sculpture was executed by talented sculptor Boris Orlovsky. The Column was inaugurated in 1834. A distinctive feature of the Alexander Column is that it's a granite monolith height 25.6 meters, standing only by gravity. The total height of the monument is 47.5 meters, taller than similar monuments: the Vendome column in Paris (in honor of the victories of Napoleon), the ancient Trajan's column in Rome and Pompaeus Magnus's one in Alexandria. Alexander Column is the tallest solid granite monument in the world, and the third highest after the Grand Army Column in Boulogne-sur-Mer and Trafalgar column (Nelson's Column) in London."
"Not open to visitors, but worth seeing from the outside. One of the oldest buildings in St. Petersburg, it was laid down November 5, 1704 and was built as a shipyard for ships of war and as a fortress to protect the nascent city. The shape of the Admiralty spread-eagled like the letter ""U"" facing the Neva. The central building is cut by a large arch, crowned by a monumental tower and spire, which ends with the famous ship, one of the symbols of St. Petersburg. The side wings of the building, facing the Neva, are decorated with statues of dolphins flagpoles. In its present form, it was constructed in 1806-1823 by the architect Andreyanov Zakharov, who fit perfectly, in the restructuring, the spire tower by Ivan Korobov from the former Admiralty building. Around the building there is the little Alexander Garden. The Admiralty building is an important dominant center of St. Petersburg. It is included in ensembles of three central areas of the city: the Palace, Senate and St. Isaac's. The three city-""rays"" depart from the tower of the Admiralty: northern - Nevsky Prospekt, the central - Gorkhovaya Street, and south - Voznesensky Prospekt."
"It was built in 1818, in the style of transition from classical to modern, and is a major attraction in the city. This is the most significant creation of Auguste Montferrand. The plan is a huge square building with a four-columned portico crowned by a large dome and four small bell towers at the corners. Three sculptures, depicting each of the 12 apostles, stand on the pediment portico. The building is interesting in technical terms too - it was the first use of a metal dome unit, and also the first time electroplating was applied to sculptures. Some scientists believe that the dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral was the archetype of the dome of the White House in Washington, D.C. Currently, St. Isaac's Cathedral is a museum-monument, open to visitors daily, except Wednesdays (ticket office closes at 18:00). For an additional fee you can visit the colonnade of the central dome (ticket office closes at 17:00). Photos and videos are charged separately. The view from the colonnade (observation deck) is one of the best views of the city, for those who are willing to climb 400 steps."
"Statuesque symbol of the city, homage to Peter the Great, opened in 1782, the theme and title of one of the most important poems of the Russian language, written by Alexander Pushkin. Its pedestal is reputed to be the largest stone ever moved by human effort."
"Built in style of the Empire, by Carl Rossi & A.E. Shtaubert, in 1829-1834. From 1925 until 2006 here was the Russian State Historical Archive. Now headquarters of the Constitutional Court of Russia."
"Built for the Imperial Horse Guards fronting on Saint Isaac's Square, in 1804-07 to Quarenghi's austere Neoclassical design. The Horse Guards Boulevard takes its name from the building. - The Manege is a low, rectangular block with arched openings and lunettes. Look like a 'mimics a 5th-century BC Athenian temple with a portico of eight Doric columns bearing a pediment and bas reliefs'. The marble statues of the Dioscuri standing beside their horses were patterned by sculptor Paolo Triscornia after the Fontana dei Dioscuri in Rome. Until to the late 1970s, the Saint Petersburg Manege has housed the city's main exhibition hall."
"This is a five-star hotel opened in December 1912. It has 213 bedrooms, including 52 suites. Hotel Astoria, along with its neighboring sister hotel, Hotel Angleterre, is managed by The Rocco Forte Collection. The hotel underwent a complete refurbishment in 2002. - It was designed by Russo-Swedish architect Fyodor Lidval, who developed a style based on art nouveau and also influenced by neo-classicism, and was constructed by a German firm"
"A 97.3m wide bridge, that spans the Moika River and this is the widest bridge in Saint Petersburg."
"Also known as Marie Palace. Built in 1839—44, by architect Andrei Shtakenshneider. In the 18th century, the plot belonged to Zakhar Tchernyshov and contained his mansion. In 1825-39, the Tchernyshov mansion housed a military school. Emperor Nicholas I conceived as a present to his daughter Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia on the occasion of her marriage. - Although the reddish-brown facade is elaborately rusticated and features Corinthian columns arranged in a traditional Neoclassical mode, the whole design was inspired by the 17th-century French Baroque messuages. Other eclectic influences are apparent in the Renaissance details of exterior ornamentation and in the interior decoration, with each main room designed in a different historic style. Until 1917, housing the State Council of Imperial Russia, State Chancellory, and Soviet of Ministers. After the October Revolution, the palace housed various Soviet ministries and academies. Later served as a hospital. From 1945 became the residence of the Leningrad Soviet (Ленсовет), succeeded by the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly in 1994"
"One of the largest cathedrals in St. Petersburg. Impressive neoclassical exterior, richly decorated interior. The temple was built by Andrew Voronikhin in the years 1801-1811 and is the best of his creations. Paul I has set the task of the architect to build a cathedral, like the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This is what the prototype he owes his great colonnade facing the Nevsky As planned Voronikhin same Colonnade was to be on the other side, but it was never implemented. By fate just built in 1811, the cathedral became a monument of Russian victories over Napoleonic France in the Patriotic War of 1812. Includes the tomb of Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, hero of the war of 1812. And in 1837, statues of Kutuzov and Barclay de Tolly, by Boris Orlovsky, were installed on the square in front of the temple. It is also interesting to note that on the north side of the cathedral (leaving on Nevsky) there is a bronze copy of the ""Gate of Paradise"" by Lorenzo Ghiberti in the Florentine Baptistery. A copy was made by caster Basil Ekimov. In 1930 the cathedral was closed, and in 1932 a unique museum of the history of religion and atheism was set up here. Now the museum moved into the building on Post Office Street, and once again this is a cathedral church."
"On the south side of the Nevsky Prospekt. Its centerpiece is a famous monument to Catherine II, designed by the famous sculptor Michael Mikeshin. At the feet of the Empress shows nine sculptural portraits of nobles: generals Pyotr Rumyantsev, Grigory Potemkin, Alexander Suvorov, dignitaries Alexander Bezborodko, Ivan Betskoy, naval Basil Chichagov, Alexei Orlov and artists Gavriil Derzhavin and Yekaterina Dashkova. The monument is made of 600 blocks Serdobol granite, brought from the island of Valaam archipelago. The monument was dedicated in 1873. - Also here is the Alexandrinsky Theatre (Александринский театр) or Russian State Pushkin Academy Drama Theater (Российский государственный академический театр драмы им. А. С. Пушкина)"
"Founded in 1795. Built by architect Yegor Sokolov specifically to be the Imperial Public Library. The library was opened in 1814 and since 1810 received a specimen copy of all domestic publications. It did not close even during the Leningrad blockade. Currently, the library is one of the largest in the world, its pool of more than 33 million books and documents. It has the largest collection of books in Russian in the world. There are such masterpieces as Ostrom Gospel XI century (the oldest surviving book in Old English), fragments of the Codex Sinaiticus IV century (in ancient Greek), Petersburg Code XI century (in Hebrew). Other units at Krylov House, Information Center, Bookshop M-Sa 10.00-20.00 (20, Sadovaya Street) & at New Building (165/2, Moskovsky Prospekt, hours=Newspapers M-F 9.00-21.00, Sa-Su 11.00-19.00) & at The Building on the Fontanka Embankment (36, Fontanka Embankment; hours=Newspapers M-F 9.00-21.00, Computer Center M-F 13.00-21.00, Sa-Su 11.00-19.00 ) at Liteyny Prospect's ''Asian & African Collection'' (49, Liteyny Prospect, hours=M-F 12.00-20.00) at Plekhanov House (1/33, 4th Krasnoarmeyskaya Street, hours=M-F 09.00-17.00)"
"Now the palace is a branch of the Russian Museum. - The palace was built to Bartolomeo Rastrelli's designs for Baron Sergei Grigoriyevich Stroganov in 1753-1754. The interiors were remodeled by Andrei Voronikhin at the turn of the 19th century. - The main façade of the Stroganov palace faces Nevsky Prospect. Here, Rastrelli rejects the cour d'honneur in the French manner. By this time, Rastrelli has developed his own style based on exploring the impressive façade, which implies the presence of three risolites, the subordination to a single center, rejection of verticalization, and stretching the building horizontally. Rastrelli gives the building a single mass movement toward the center. He skillfully emphasizes this by subordinating the lateral risolites to the central, imposing group of columns of purely decorative, not architectonic, function, deliberately building up tension toward the center of the sculpted front. Rastrelli uses the giant order, the method of visual fusion of the second and third floor windows, typical for the Baroque, and the differentiated arrangement of columns closely adjacent to the wall in order to create a masterful effect and an impressive Baroque façade facing St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. The facade carries an entrance arch supported by two Corinthian columns. The arch is crowned with a pediment bearing the Stroganov coat of arms. The spaces under the windows on the facade feature a man's profile. There are two practically anecdotal versions regarding this man's identity. According to one version, the man is the first owner of the palace, Baron Stroganov, whom Rastrelli wanted to surprise. However, many historians claim that the famous architect in fact left his own profile on the palace walls."
"It is one of the oldest and largest Protestant churches in Russia. It was and still is called the German church as its members were mostly German-speaking."
"This is the oldest Catholic church in Russia, and the only church in Russia with the title of minor basilica. - On October 7, 1783, the church was completed. Because the Empress at the time was Catherine II of Russia (also known as Catherine the Great), the church was named after St. Catherine of Alexandria. Under the Soviets, the activities of the church were repressed. For 30 years, the building was used only as storage space for the nearby ""Museum of History of Religion and of Atheism"" located in former Our Lady of Kazan Church. Since 1980's the government used the building as offices and apartments. In 1992, city authorities decided to return the building to the Catholic Church. The restoration of the church was completed in 2008. - The building is in the shape of a Latin cross. The transept of the church is crowned by a large cupola. The temple is 44m in length, 25m in width, and 42m in height. The sanctuary has room for about 2,000 people. The main facade of the church has a monumental arched portal, which rests on self-supporting columns. Above the facade is a high parapet, with the figures of four evangelists and angels on top. Above the main entrance is an inscription from the Gospel of Matthew (in Latin): ""My house shall be called the house of prayer"" (Matthew 21:13) and the date the church was completed."
"Established in 1785. The Neoclassical headquarters of the Duma were erected on the main city avenue, Nevsky Prospekt, between 1784 and 1787. The famous Italianate tower was added in 1799–1804. In 1847–52, the edifice was rebuilt in the Neo-Renaissance style. Two more floors were added to the building in 1913–14. A spacious central hall of the City Duma was frequently let to host high-profile social events. Its distinctive tower, used for fire observation, can still be seen the whole length of Nevsky Prospekt after the crossing with Fontanka River."
"This is a vast department store. This Gostiny Dvor is not only the city's oldest shopping centre, but also one of the first shopping arcades in the world. Sprawling for over one kilometer and embracing the area of 53,000m2, the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building works commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional Neoclassical design submitted by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe (1729–1800). - The next century, Gostiny Dvor was continuously augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. By that time, the Gostiny Dvor had lost its popularity to the more fashionable Passage and New Passage, situated on the Nevsky Prospekt nearby. During the post-World War II reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being. This massive 18th-century structure got a face-lift recently and entered the 21st century as one of the most fashionable shopping centres in Eastern Europe. A nearby station of Saint Petersburg Metro takes its name from Gostiny Dvor."
"It is recognized as an historical landmark, and has official status as an object of Russian cultural heritage. - The building was designed by architect Pavel Suzor for the Russian branch of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The Saint Petersburg building code did not allow structures taller than the Winter Palace, residence of the emperor. The architect found an elegant solution to the limit of 23.5m : the six-storey Art Nouveau building is crowned with a glass tower, which in turn is topped by a glass globe sculpture created by the Estonian artist Amandus Adamson. This tower creates the impression of a substantial elevation, but is subtle enough not to overshadow either the Kazan Cathedral or the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. - In 1919, the building was given to the Petrograd State Publishing House. It became the city's largest book store, and was subsequently named ""The House of Books"" in 1938. The book store remained functioning during the Siege of Leningrad until November 1942. It reopened again in 1948. The building now is home of the familiar House of Books and Café Singer."
"This is an elite department store, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998. Parenthetically, the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre.The name came from a vast gallery between Nevsky Avenue and Italianskaya Street which provided the main passage through the mall. The gallery was covered over by an arching glass and steel roof, thus giving it a claim to being one of the world's first shopping malls. The three-storey building opened on May 9, 1848. It was one of the first structures in Russia to employ gas for lighting. Another innovation was an underground floor, where an electric station would be installed in 1900. Although the store specialized in jewellery, expensive clothes and other luxury goods, crowds of common people flocked to see the most fashionable shop of the Russian Empire. Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor,- the developer,- conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo. - To draw even more consumers to the store, the Soleille, one of the largest cinemas in the Russian capital, was opened in the complex in 1908. - In 1933, the municipal authorities declared the Passage a ""model department store"", the only one in Leningrad (former St Petersburg) and one of only three such stores in the Soviet Union. The renovated ""palace of Soviet trade"" (as the media touted it) opened in 1934 and offered about 30,000 types of goods, all manufactured in the USSR. The Children's World section became especially popular with the inhabitants of Leningrad. - Now privately owned by employees and shareholders."
"Built in 1902-1903 by the architect Gabriel Baranovsky in the style of early modern to colonial goods store Eliseev Brothers. Building facades are adorned with four statues of ""Industry"", ""Trade"", ""Art"" and ""Science"" by Estonian sculptor Amandus Adamson (who also worked on the sculptural decoration of Dom Knigi and Baron Stieglitz School). No less interesting design trade halls, located on the first floor. The second floor housed Comedy Theatre. - Passage established relations with new trade and business partners, such as Escada, and other international department stores. One of the first upscale food markets in Russia, with a wide variety of international produce, opened in the basement. New restaurant opened on the upper level with the panoramic view of the Nevsky Prospect."
"Formerly owned by Antonio de Vieira, takes its name from the nearby Anichkov Bridge across the Fontanka. Designed for the Empress Elizabeth of Russia in a dazzling Baroque style, the palace came to be known as the most imposing private residence of the Elizabethan era. Built in 1754. There was extensive renovations and the palace got the newly-fashionable Neoclassical style, which was effected in 1778 and 1779. Simultaneously a regular park was laid out by an English garden architect, William Hould. - After 1917, this was nationalized and designated the St. Petersburg City Museum. Since 1934, when it was converted into the Young Pioneer Palace, the palace has housed over hundred after-school clubs for more than 10,000 children. While a small '''museum''' inside is open to the public at selected times, the edifice is normally not accessible to tourists."
"Built in 1841-42 and reconstructed in 1906-08, combines a simple form with some spectacular decorations. As well as its four famous horse sculptures (1849–50). The structure is mentioned in the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and Dostoevsky. - The bridge was made of stone, and had three spans closed off with gently sloping arches. This simple, concise form corresponded well with the massive cast-iron fencing bordering Anichkov Bridge and mermaid cast-iron railings, originally designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for the Palace Bridge in Berlin. In 1906-08 the bridge had to be reconstructed and its arches reinforced. - '''The Horse Tamers''' rank among the city's most recognizable landmarks. The theme derives from the colossal Roman marbles, often identified with the Dioscuri, prominently sited on the Quirinal Hill, Rome."
"This is a Neo-Baroque palace. Built on Nevsky Prospekt in 1747 for Prince Mikhail Andreevitch Belosselsky. The original building far smaller than it is today, was designed in the French style with a large private garden and a launch onto the canal, stuccoed and painted in imitation of Parisian limestone. The present palace is said to look similar to the nearby Rastrelliesque Stroganov Palace which is further up the Nevsky Prospect, on the corner of Moika canal. After their major renovations in 1847-48, the palace — complete with piano nobile, concert hall, Van Loo paintings, and palace church — acquired a dazzling Rococo appearance. In 1883 Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich bought and gave the palace its present red exterior. -During the First World War, the palace was the base of the Anglo-Russian Hospital. In 1907 it was nationalised and went on to house a regional Soviet until 1991, when it was designated a municipal cultural centre. Now host chamber '''concerts''' for small audiences. It today also hosts a large '''wax work'''."
"Another central area of ​​the city, formed by the intersection of Nevsky and Ligovsky prospects. Here stand the Soviet-era '''Hero-City of Leningrad obelisk''' (Обелиск «Городу-герою Ленинграду»), which hosts the Veterans Parade on every Victory Day (9 May), when the square is decorated with banners."
"This is a station on the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line of Saint Petersburg Metro. It is one of the system's original stations. Made by architects Boris Zhuravlev, Ivan Fomin and VV Gankevich, built in 1955. It is a deep underground pylon station at 58m depth. The main surface vestibule is situated on Vosstaniya Square, which gives its name to the station. Another exit (opened in 1960) opens directly into the Moskovsky Rail Terminal. Ploshchad Vosstaniya is connected to the station Mayakovskaya of the Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya Line via a transfer corridor and a set of escalators."
"Erected in 1847-1851 under the project of architect Konstantin Ton, a ""twin"" of the Leningrad station built in Moscow. Also called Moscow station, with an easily recognizable Neo-Renaissance frontage is a terminal railway station. It is a terminus for the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway and other lines running from Central and South Russia, Siberia, Eastern Ukraine, and Crimea. - The oldest preserved station in the city. Although large ""Venetian"" windows, two floors of Corinthian columns and a two-storey clocktower at the centre explicitly reference Italian Renaissance architecture, the building incorporates other features from a variety of periods and countries. - Expanded in 1869-79 and 1912. Completely redeveloped in 1950-52 and 1967. A bronze bust of Peter the Great in the main vestibule was unveiled in 1993, replacing a bust of Lenin. The station is served by the Mayakovskaya and Vosstaniya Square stations of the Saint Petersburg Metro, with both stations linked to the station building by an underground corridor."
"A four star hotel in a historic building. Built in the years 1851 by the architect A.P. Gemilian, the four-storey ""Znamenskaya hotel"", was subsequently called the ""North"", ""Great Northern"", and after the revolution was ""October."" It was reconstructed several times. - The hotel consists of two buildings: “Oktiabrskiy” (Ligovskiy av., 10 - 373 rooms) and “Ligovskiy” (Ligovskiy av., 41/83 - 111 rooms). - There are no absolutely the same rooms in the hotel. All rooms are unique and differ from each other by nuances of layout and decoration."

"Date of theatre birth is 17th of September of 1929, in that day two united operetta companies – Theatres of Musical comedy from Kharkov and Leningrad presented on its stage one of the first Soviet operetta.- This building has been constructed in 1799–1801, by E.Sokolov. A prominent St. Petersburg merchant I. Lazarev, gave one of numerous houses for Theatre. In 1842–1896 an Italian architect L. Vendramini the house was rebuilt. - In 1896 Grand duke Nikolay Nikolaevich, grandson of Nikolay I, had bought the house and afterwards presented it to his favourite - well-known actress of Alexandrinsky Theatre M. Pototzkaya. In all probability in this period at will of Grand duke interiors of first floor were anew trimmed, and became splendid palace apartments. In 1910 year building was passed to treasury, and then was bought by private entrepreneur I. Piltzov, the inner apartments of the building were reconstructed for presenting theatre productions. - Interiors of theatre, cozy and elegant, bear marks of very different architecture styles, that is why they are eclectic in astonishing way. Well-known in whole city three-flights stairs, reception-rooms, lobbies with quaint patterns of modelling, dissemination of painting and bronze are evidence of refinement of rococo style. In decoration of lobby placed over entrance to the theatre could be seen influence of style of Italian Renaissance. One lobby was specially rebuilt as a grotto, which was stylish tendency in the beginning of 20th century. Walls of this hall were faced with raw masonry, in which cracks were hidden electric light bulbs; and in small ponds placed in the corners of grotto water flowed. Sometimes in theatre came people who were not interested in theatre at all, they were just curious – they wanted to see the luxurious stairs and to visit grotto. - In architecture of the hall – one of the most early and few in number Petersburg interiors of public purpose of the 1900's – it’s possible to see the influence of Russian late classicism, «streamlined neoclassicism». Hall differs from vivid theatre foyers by accented monumentality, plane angles of walls and discretion of architectural details; and elements of architecture borrowed from late classicism went well together with forms corresponding with engineer possibilities of that time. -"
"A traditional style Russian church built on the spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881. Built in 1883-1907, in style of Romantic Nationalism. Architecturally, the Cathedral harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism. It intentionally resembles the 17th-century Yaroslavl churches and the celebrated St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The '''interior''' is elaborately decorated with over 7000 m² of mosaics. The walls and ceilings inside the Church are completely covered in intricately detailed mosaics — the main pictures being biblical scenes or figures — but with very fine patterned borders setting off each picture. - Now is part of the State Historical Museum. It is a '''[http://eng.cathedral.ru/saviour Museum of Mosaics] {{dead link|May 2016}}'''"

"Each one of its façades is different. Surrounded by a moat with drawbridge, built by Paul I who feared for his life - in fact he was murdered here inside, in his bedroom. Nowadays a branch of the Russian Museum, its Portrait Gallery, is housed here."
"This is an architectural monument of the 1760s. There is the combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicizing monumentality. The palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome marbles. A rough-grained Finnish granite on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink Karelian marble of the pilasters and white Urals marble of capitals and festoons. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while Tallinn dolomite was employed for ornamental urns. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace. - The plan of the edifice is trapezoidal: each of its four facades, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. The palace court is dominated by a sturdy equestrian statue of Alexander III of Russia,- or Alexander Alexandrovich Romanov (10 Mar 1845–1 Nov 1894) who was Emperor of Russia, King of Poland and Grand Prince of Finland,- the most famous work of sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy; formerly it graced the obelisk's spot at Vosstanya Square, before the Moscow Railway Station. In 1843, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace. An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the eclectic tastes of its new owner. Only the main staircase and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor. - Former Lenin Museum, '''now''', the palace accommodates permanent exhibitions of the Russian State Museum, notably ""Foreign Artists in Russia (18th and 19th centuries)"" and the ""Peter Ludwig Museum at the Russian Museum"", featuring canvases by Andy Warhol and other Pop Art idols."

It was the third permanent bridge across the Neva, built between 1897 and 1903 by the French firm Société de Construction des Batignolles. It is 582m long and 23.6m wide. - The bridge takes its name from the Old Trinity Cathedral which used to stand at its northern end. In the 20th century it was known as Equality Bridge (мост Ра́венства, 1918-1934) and Kirovsky Bridge (Ки́ровский мост, 1934-1999)."
"There is the '''Smolny Convent''' and the '''Smolny Institute''', a yellow low building that was Russia's first educational establishment for women, created by decree under the personal patronage of Empress Catherine II, and continued to function until just before the 1917 revolution. A nice garden and iron-work grille around the institute date from the early 19th century. In 1917, the building was chosen by Vladimir Lenin as Bolshevik headquarters during the October Revolution. It was Lenin's residence for several months, until the national government was moved to the Moscow Kremlin. After 1991, the Smolny was used as the seat of the city mayor (governor after 1996) and city administration. Vladimir Putin worked there from 1991 to 1997."
"Smolny Cathedral of the Resurrection (Smolny Cathedral), what is a gorgeous blue and white main church, considered to be one of the architectural masterpieces of architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli. The Cathedral is the centerpiece of the convent, built by Rastrelli between 1748 and 1764. The projected bell-tower was to become the tallest building in St. Petersburg and, at the time, all of Russia. Elizabeth's death in 1762 prevented Rastrelli from completing this grand design. The new Empress strongly disapproved of the baroque style, and funding that had supported the construction of the convent rapidly ran out. Rastrelli was unable to build the huge bell-tower he had planned and unable to finish the interior of the cathedral. - In 1835 by Vasily Stasov with the addition of a neo-classical interior to suit the changed architectural tastes at the time. - The main altar was dedicated to the Resurrection and the two side altars were dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene and Righteous Elizabeth. Today, Smolny Cathedral is used primarily as a concert hall and the surrounding convent buildings house various offices and government institutions."
"Firstly commissioned by Prince Grigory Potemkin of Tauridia to his favourite architect, Ivan Starov. Empress Catherine the Great gave Potemkin the land and the title of Prince of Tauridia for his services in conquering ancient Tauridia (now the Crimean Peninsula). Catherine II later bought the Palace, to be used as her summer townhouse. Much later yet (1906), it was transformed into the seat of the first Russian parliament, the Imperial State Duma. Immediately after the February Revolution of 1917, Tauride Palace housed the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. The abortive Russian Constituent Assembly held its meetings there in 1918. Since the 1990s, Tauride Palace has been home to the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (IPA CIS). - Take a '''Parliament tour''' in Tauride Palace: During the tour, guests will make a walk in three state rooms and other spaces of the Tauride Palace, learn the history of its inhabitants, visit the magnificent Duma Hall - the place of the State Duma of the Russian Empire, to see an exhibition on the history of Russian parliamentarism. - Duration: 60min. - Only possible by prior arrangement with a passport. -"
"This was laid out in 1783-1789 on the estate of the Palace from which it took its name. The Tauride Garden was landscaped in English Romantic style, with landscape, ponds and canals designed to imitate nature. Trees and shrubs were brought in especially from England. In 1866 the Tauride Garden was opened to the public, and has remained a favorite spot with city dwellers for walks ever since."
"Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov (1730-1800) was one of Russia's most outstanding generals, a military strategist and army commander during the reign of Empress Catherine the Great and Emperor Paul I. The museum features military memorabilia from Suvorov's times: weapons, banners, uniforms, models and large graphic recreations of historic battlefields. Two large mosaics decorate its façade. Both are based on historical events; the left-hand one features ""Suvorov Crossing the Alps"" and the right-hand one illustrates ""Suvorov leaving home for the campaign of 1799""."
"Ordered to be built by empress Elizabeth. Construction lasted from 1743 to 1754; designed by architect Mikhail Zemtsov. After the death of Mikhail Zemtsov, Pietro Antonio Trezzini headed construction. Trezzini slightly changed the project, changing the style to Baroque. Façades and the interior were restored between 1946 and 1948. From 1832-1833, a fence, formed by the barrels of Turkish cannons taken from Turkish fortresses, was built around the cathedral, commemorating the victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829. Preserved on the barrels is the engraved coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire, and on some of the barrels can be seen the names given to the cannons."
"Located at the Eastern end of Nevskiy Prospekt, next to the River Neva; Peter I founded it in 1710, supposing that that was the site of the Neva Battle in 1240, where Prince Alexander Nevsky defeated the Swedes (however, the battle actually took place about 12 miles away from that site). The purpose of the foundation was to house the relics of St. Alexander Nevsky, patron of the newly-founded Russian capital; however, the massive silver sarcophagus of St. Alexander was relocated during Soviet times to the Hermitage, where it remains (without the relics) today. In 1797, the monastery was raised to the rank of lavra, making it only the third lavra in the Russian Church, along with Kiev Monastery of the Caves and the Trinity Monastery of Sergeyev Posad. - Here is also the site of the 'Tikhvin Cemetery' which houses the tombs of some very famous Russians: Mikhail Lomonosov, Alexander Suvorov, Nikolay Karamzin, Modest Mussorgsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Glinka, Natalia Goncharova and Alexander Borodin, along with others not so famous."
"Apartment building, a magnificent example of Russian Art Nouveau. At the entrance - sculpture sun god Ra, above the columns - bas Egyptian scenes, decorated archway into the yard."
"The museum is located in a former Handicraft Museum (1901-1903, architect PP Trifanov), what is part of the museum buildings Solyanka quarter. Museum dedicated to the events of the Leningrad blockade. This has a branch museum: 'the national museum Road of Life' in Kokkorevo village. The collection include: samples of weapons and household items, campaign posters, documents, maps, newspapers period battle, documentary evidence of the conditions of life in the besieged Leningrad, paintings and sculptures participants battle. - Guided tours: ☎ +7 812 279-3021"
"It was established in November 1930 as part of the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, but was not opened until six years later.- The museum is located in Avraam Melnikov's Neoclassical church from the 1820s and remains the largest museum dedicated to polar exploration in the world."
"Open 2 times per night to allow boats to pass."
"Allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying unhurried the neoclassical and baroque wonders of architecture, landscaping and gardening of the Imperial Capital, of rare beauty at any time of any season. Read or reread the works of the great Russian writers -  ""White Nights"" by Dostoevsky first, ""The Overcoat"" by Gogol in second, then Tolstoy, Chekhov, Brodsky, Pushkin, Mayakovsky, Nabokov and several others - they found so much inspiration in this pavement. In winter, use non-slip boots with thick socks to protect your ankles, and avoid the ice."
"The Mariinsky Theater (formerly the Kirov, which is the name the troupe still uses when touring abroad) is world-class for both opera and ballet. There are English supertitles for operas sung in Russian; operas in other languages have Russian supertitles. Performances are offered in two halls: the main theater, and the newly-built Mariinsky Concert Hall. Tickets can be purchased on the theater's website."
"The exterior is not as recognizable as the Mariinsky, but the interior is nearly as grand, and the theater hosts both Russian and foreign headliners in opera and ballet."
"An intimate theater (half-sized stage, and only about 150-200 audience seats) which puts on the major repertory operas at a lower price than the major theaters and has a fascinating foyer - one has to see it to believe it."
"While the hall itself is not lavish - quite sterile, really - a good option for seeing Russian and repertory operas cheaply, performed by faculty and students of the conservatory where Tchaikovsky (and many other famous figures from the Russian music world) studied."
"A world-class orchestra which records and tours abroad. The Small Hall (Maliy Saal) hosts excellent chamber music performances and recitals."
"The Small Hall (Maliy Saal) of the Philharmonic hosts excellent chamber music performances and recitals."
"Offers a variety of jazz performances several times per week."
"Pop and rock concerts in an auditorium close to the city center."
"Sometimes shows films in their original language."
"Canal boat tours in English, departing from near the Anichkov Bridge (Nevksy Prospekt and Fontanka) in season (May 2 - Sept 30)."
"Culture centre located in five-storey former bakery building with several exhibition spaces (combined surface around 0.5ha). Contemporary art exhibitions, concerts, events (flea markets). Parts of Etagi loft are two art galleries, four exhibitions spaces, a cafe (with great interior and outside terrace), a hostel and a bookshop."
"The Apraksin Market (Apraksin Dvor) is perfect for people watching, but keep your purse and camera close since it is a favorite of both shoppers and pickpockets. You can find almost anything here."
"A six-story building, built in 1902-1904 on the project of Paul Suzor to be the Russian headquarters of Singer sewing machines American company. Art Nouveau is not typical of the Nevsky Prospect, however it blended well into the face of St. Petersburg. It is believed that the company wanted to build a multi-story building, like its skyscraper in New York City. However, the height regulations prohibit building structures up more than 23.5 meters. The architect thus decided to build a graceful tower, crowned with a glass globe, which creates the illusion of elevation, while not overshadowing either the Kazan Cathedral or the Savior on Spilled Blood church. The sculptural decoration of the tower and the facade were created by Estonian sculptor Amandus Adamson, also worked on the design of the shop and school Eliseevsky Baron Stieglitz. Today it is the city's biggest and most important bookstore, a tourist attraction on its own right. A cafe operates on the second floor."
"&mdash; The city's oldest and largest shopping centre, dating to the mid-18th century. The name means ""Merchant Yard"", as its old role was to provide both shops and housing to merchants from far away. It sells almost everything from PlayStations to Saint Petersburg Vodka. On the north side is a decent store for second-hand photo equipment selling cameras and lenses (Nikon, Canon, Sigma etc.). The prices of goods are the highest in St.Petersburg. More see above at Saint Petersburg/Center#Along Nevsky Prospekt"
"Saint Petersburg's Champs-Élysées, lined with department stores and fancy shops. A recommended shop for souvenir hunters is Nevsky Gifts on the corner of the road entering Palace Square."
"The Harrods of Saint Petersburg, a smaller and very beautiful shopping center for the elite. More see above at Saint Petersburg/Center#Along Nevsky Prospekt"
"This market appears to have closed in Spring 2014, though there are still some souvenir stalls around the Church of the Spilt Blood"
"These fast-food restaurants serve blini (Russian crepes) with a variety of fillings - you choose your own at the counter. They also have a wide selection of teas. Some restaurants have wifi."
"Has 6 restaurants in the city, mainly in the centre. Decent food with very affordable prices, smoking and non-smoking sections. Staff in some restaurants may actually serve you in English."
"It a big chain of fast food restaurants that offers baked potatoes with your choice of topping but also has salads, soups and deserts."
"This blini chain began with street-corner kiosks throughout the city (many are quite easy to find), and they have expanded to include counter-service restaurants serving not only blini, but also kasha, salads, and other quick, inexpensive fare. Some central locations are Bolshaya Morskaya Ul. 11, and Nevsky Pr. 106. The restaurants have menus in English if you ask."
"This neighborhood blini shop makes blini as good as homemade (so says a native Russian blini-maker). Choose from a wide range of fillings and have your tasty blini made fresh; also has a decent selection of tea. Better lunch than any of the chains. No English; but you can just point at the fillings on the counter if you don't want to bother translating the menu with your guide book."
"Cafeteria-style Russian and Ukrainian food for a reasonable price with faux-rustic decor, not like a Soviet-era ''stolovaya''. Has more than blini: soups, salads, meat dishes, desserts, etc. Those who know the Mu-Mu chain in Moscow will recognize this, although on a smaller scale.  More units: - Цветочная улица д.16. Тел. 495-54-65 , .- -   Рижский проспект д.12.  Тел. 575-39-55"
"Good and cheap food in the very centre . Pay attention, there are two restaurants called St. Petersburg next to each other and the second one is more expensive."
"cafe-restaurant ambience during the day, turning into bar in the evening as well as music venue at night. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Good and moderately priced food served 24 hours a day. The menu comes in both English and Russian. Friendly and helpful English-speaking staff. Free Wi-Fi. Separated smoking/non-smoking sections."
"Several units. Ulitsa Efimova, 1/14 Zagorodnyy prospekt, 45 а"
"[http://en.pizzahut.spb.ru/restaurants Several units]."
"Very nice, cosy little tea and cake shop near Griboedova canal with a sweet faux-French atmosphere. You can also have tasty meals there."
"A great family-run place just a block away from the spectacular must-see Smolniy Monastery and Tavricheskiy garden. Fresh local and foreign beers, great cuisine (huge portions), English menus and English-speaking staff. Great for watching sport events too."
"This would be but an ordinary undistinguished Uzbek restaurant, were it not within one block of the Winter Palace. Given location, the place is spectacular in that it maintains decent service and very good food."
"Right on the water, this restaurant offers Italian food alongside a French/Asian fusion menu. Friendly people, delightful atmosphere, and a wonderful view, Acquarel is a wonderful and delicious dinner option or even a great place to relax and get a drink in their lounge chairs."
"In a city with plenty of Uzbek food, this may outshine the competition. Not for the service or the decor, but for the very long menu of top-notch Uzbek cooking."
"After the enormous success of opening bar ""Mishka"" last year, avant-garde musician/heartthrob Kirill Ivanov and budding chef-mogul Alexander Berkovksy have ventured into the restaurant, or more precisely ""cafe-club,"" business. ""Obschestvo Chistykh Tarelok"", or ""Clean Plates Society"" in English, is named after a children's fairy tale alleging that Lenin told children that those who finish all the food on their plate would become members of the Clean Plates Society. Quality burgers, cream soups and vegetarian dishes with worldwide influences. Almost everything is under RUB300. Recommended for hipster-watching in St. Petersburg."
"A very reasonably priced Japanese chain restaurant just across the street from the Chernyshevskaya metro station. The interior is very stylish, even if the fashion shows on the TVs are a bit much, and you can control your service with the aid of a call button. The food is good, but the sodas might be even better&mdash;free refills! It's also a very solid choice for a place to unwind late-night after a wild night."
"Excellent desserts (tiramisù is really great); good reviews for dinner. Wide selection of international fare: Thai, Italian, Russian, steaks. Rare place with 5 varieties of Caesar salad. Outdoor terrace is comfortable for a baby stroller, but closes before late Sept."
"Decent lower-end French cuisine. Nothing-special breakfasts: either omlet or croissant or porridge."
"Kafe Kat is a tucked into a rather unassuming location, just off Nevsky. This little restaurant serves what might be the best Georgian food in St. Petersburg. There is an English menu and the staff is friendly. RUB1500 for 2, 3 courses + beer"
"Georgian food. The dishes prepared in pots are excellent."
"Named after the Dostoevsky novel, and offering a wide variety of very tasty vegan, vegetarian, and seafood dishes at prices higher than what you'd expect. All served in a very cozy and attractive cellar stocked with books, expats, and intellectuals."
"American cuisine, steaks, good wine and pleasant atmosphere. A bit expensive (the best steak costs 850 rubles), but it is worth it."
"Artictic minimalism interior; creative fusion cuisine."
"Chinese in Saint Petersburg is often better than in most parts of Europe. This restaurant is cozy and overcrowded (show up early or late if you want to ensure that you get a table), and has an extraordinarily long and complex menu. If you have no native speaker with you, bring a food dictionary, or you will have no idea what you are ordering."
"Excellent Italian food in a white nearly-luxury setting. In peak hours, choose easier-to-cook dishes to minimize risk of mistake. Great gaspacho, ""quatro formagio"" pizza. Good for a late breakfast as well (although no breakfast-time menu: only omlets, RUB170). Heated outdoor terrace open until at least end of Sep. No wifi, for a reason: it's a place to eat."
"A chain of Italian restaurants; free wifi. Outdoor terrace is open heated until at least end of Sep; terrace perfect with toddler: spacious enough for baby strollers; has children-safe wide couches."
"Greek restaurant with a genuine Greek chef; popular with expats."
"Tourists-oriented and doesn't hide it, the place has a good selection of traditional Russian dishes. Buffet and restaurant share the same building and kitchen and have few common dishes, but are otherwise very distant from each other (at least in prices). Free wifi (ask waiter for instructions)."
"currently loosing its charm and excellent service. Still, quite charming good value for money, although drinks are quite expensive. Fireplace in winter and courtyard with umbrellas and flowers in summer. Most staff speak English, those who don't are still helpful at navigating the English menu. Lunch set menu from 1PM. Equally good for breakfast (from 9AM, Mon-Fri only) with omlets, pancakes, a weekly rotation of porridges and fritters. Free wifi (ask waiter for instructions); children's playroom; separate non/smokers; outdoor terrace open until at least 5ths of Oct (but no gas heaters). Same owners as a nearby Zoom Cafe."
"A very fun Russian restaurant, that would be worth visiting as a gallery of weird spy-kitsch, but the food is also decent. No wifi."
"Good-quality Caucasian cuisine in a vivid interior. Excellent ''shahlyki'' and ''manty''."
"Business lunch from 12:00-17:00 with 3 options. The RUB250 one includes salad, soup, main meal, garnish (a.k.a side dish), berry drink, and bread. The RUB200 option include no soup and the RUB150 includes no course/garnish. Menus have English translation and several staffs can speak English."
"Same owners as Tepló, but much more intimate;not a victim of top TripAdvisor positions."
"One of the city's more impressive interiors, modeled after the palaces of the Shirvan Shahs (imagine eating in Sheki's Khan-Saray). Opened in 2006, has received rave reviews from all quarters since,offering some of the best dishes you can taste in Saint Petersburg. A great place to try out Azeri cuisine with great meat dishes."
"About this price includes a full caviar spread and sushi bar in addition to the normal brunch fare (carving station, omelette station, salads, fruit, baked goods, desserts, the options are nearly endless). There is also bottomless champagne glasses (and the champagne is quite good) and a huge frozen ice sculpture that is tapped where you can refill your glass with iced vodka as many times as you'd like. The jazz is very good and the pace is relaxed and enjoyable. The only caveat: As with most Russian eateries, there is no non-smoking section, so if you are not a smoker, ask for table away from the majority or risk having to inhale cigarette smoke while you dine."
"Overdone and overpriced Russian-kitsch tourist trap for foreigners (Russians wouldn't be caught dead here). But if you're staying nearby, they'll treat you fine and you can eat some bear meat."
"A great, small, cozy, and very stylish brick-walled Russian restaurant, with excellent food, and good enough service. Live entertainment comes often, and is often surprisingly good&mdash;imagine sitting down and only then seeing a solo jazz guitarist sit down to play some beautiful music. It's been open for more than a decade, and there's a reason why it's a fixture of the local restaurant scene around Furshtatskaya."
"Offers magnificent view to Kazansky cathedral from terrace. Pastries are well worth the price."
"The only restaurant of Michelin starred chef alain Ducasse in Russia. Offers dishes prepared by local product with French know how as well as Alain Ducasse classics."
"Very home-atmosphere and friendly."
"A quiet cocktail bar."
"Dickens Pub offers good service, great food, and a wide range of English and other international beers, with over 15 on tap. There are also many superior whiskeys too! Dickens Pub is a good place to eat. Be prepared for a party - especially on Fridays & Saturdays!"
"Crowded bar with live jazz music."
"A comfortable, big bar with upscale drinks and cooking. The biggest draw is the cool clientele and live performances: blues, jazz, R&B. One tip though, if you open the door to a DJ blaring Russkaya popsa&mdash;leave because you won't be able to hear yourself think."
"Combination bar and laundromat. Have a beer while washing your clothes! Operated by a famous local designer that also operates the Produkty Fontanka 17 club."
"The Tower Pub is a great place to rest, have a quick drink or stay for the whole evening. The bartenders are really nice, do speak English and are in for a chat (on a quiet night). It's located in the basement of a large building but the atmosphere is really nice. No live music."
"A classy wine bar."
"Old-world luxury atmosphere. Smart casual attire."
"A suitably spaced out place for a club whose name can also be interpreted as ""the mushroom eater"" or a famous Russian's poet surname, the acts here are famously offbeat, especially on weekdays when you're as likely to find a poetry reading as live reggae or a DJ spinning psychedelic trance. This club is hidden in an underground bomb shelter with a new performance space/bar/restaurant atop the bunker's hill."
"Saint Petersburg's biggest club, with 3 floors. Mostly for people aged 16-30. Eurodisco music such as techno, trance and house."
"A popular DJ bar/cafe for local scenesters, as well as 20-something tourists and ex-pats, located on the most central intersection (Nevsky prospekt and Fontanka).  Due to strict dress code don't try to enter with a backpack and be ready to  hear that the party tonight is ""invitation only"". It means the security did not like your look. The place was opened by St. Petersburg avant-garde musician and heartthrob Kirill Ivanov and friends in the beginning of 2011, at the end of 2011 Mishka has already achieved the title of'' St. Petersburg's Best Bar'' according to TimeOut magazine. During daytime, Mishka more of a cafe (with free WiFi), where you can relax, read and/or chat and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and fresh salads. In fact, it's one of the few places that serves in line with the Western understanding of ""salad"" - a huge bowl of fresh greens with a choice of other fresh ingredients to add, rather than the traditional Russian understanding of salad which is usually a lot of mayonnaise with other ingredients and often without any greens at all. There are two spaces - the entrance space is the ""club"" side, generally the rowdier side and the place to get boozed up and drunkenly dance the night away, and the second space is more relaxed, more brightly lit, non-smoking, and a comfortable place to grab a bite to eat (even at 4am!) and sit and chat with your friends without shouting over the music from the entrance space.  At night there is usually a DJ playing (even on weeknights!) whatever hipsters are listening to these days (rather than typical Russian clubs that only play worn-out house and 90s pop) and the bar can get very crowded on weekend nights.  Try one of the dozens of specialty shots to get your night started in the right spirit... or to end your night, if you're on a bender."
"Cavernous live music hall with old brick walls and loft outdoor bar, separate room with wrap-around bar and small DJ stand, chill-out room with small concerts and a terrace bar for dancing under the White Nights skies. Pizza is sold in the back. Very diverse music program: from reggae to punk/metal, but mostly rock. Friendly atmosphere. The crowd is made up of students, musicians, artists and expats. The space also includes MOD Gallery with local art on display. Design of the club is worth checking out as well. Menus in English, English-speaking bartenders, inexpensive beer."
"Literally, 'Groceries'. Opened in the fall of 2011 by designer Lisa Izvozchikova, owner of Stirka bar. The space is modest in size, but being one of the rare cafe-bars in St. Petersburg located above basement-level, boasts views of the Fontanka and features local DJs as well as more ""amateur"" music lovers spinning their favorite tunes, sipping cocktails and occasionally dancing and even singing along if the mood strikes them. Produkty features a carefully thought-out range of alcohol - all the makings of any classic cocktail as well as a delicious and dry cider ""St. Anton"", grog, milkshakes with berries, a homemade hot ginger tea, as well as freshly squeezed orange juice. The food is mainly vegetarian, and the offerings include couscous and sandwiches. All the furniture was brought from Berlin: the leatherette-upholstered bar, massive leather armchairs, round bar stools from the 1970s, chairs taken from GDR kindergartens and schools, typewriters and a Wurlitzer jukebox that only accepts Deutschmark (don't worry! you can buy the necessary Deutschmark tokens at the bar). The classic hipster-reference to East Germany is not completely lost when it comes to describing the style and clientele of Produkty.."

"Built in 1912, Al Ahmadiya School was Dubai's first school and has now been nicely restored. It would be a stretch to call the exhibits of old reed pens and diplomas fascinating, but they've tried pretty hard, and if nothing else, the air-con and clean toilets may come in handy.

"Has Dubai's only Ikea, since it relocated from City Centre, and a huge Plug-Ins electronic store. Also an ACE Hardware and an amazing mall that has 550 shops."
"A large mall with 500+ stores, over 80 restaurants and cafés and plenty of entertainment and recreation sites inside it."
"Not a mall, but a '''historic market''' that has been a part of Dubai since the origin of Dubai itself. Located at the mouth of the creek, it dazzles people by selling gold in large quantities and with little visible security. A must visit for shoppers and sightseers. Most of the gold is 22ct quality and quite expensive - although even here the shopkeepers are prepared to bargain - and the craftsmanship can be remarkably detailed. The gold items are sold by weight with a ""making charge"" added on top to cover the workmanship. It pays therefore, to go shopping armed with the current gold price and a knowledge of the making charges in order to hone the bargaining process. Many outlets are part of chains that also have branches in malls, so are generally reliable."
"As above, not a mall, but a '''historic market''' that has been a part of Dubai since the origin of Dubai itself. Located at the mouth of the creek, it is not far from the Gold Souk, but has sadly declined a bit in recent years as supermarkets take over the spice trade. If you're actually shopping for spices, odds are you'll get better prices and quality with much less hassle at Carrefour. Both the Spice Souk and the Gold Souq are a rather hot and sweaty experience with limited air-conditioning, so wear appropriately cool, loose clothing if visiting in mid summer. Individual shops are air conditioned. Although regularly visited by tourists, none of the souks are considered a tourist area and as such modest dress should be worn to avoid causing offence or attracting unwanted attention."
"A wonderful noodle bar located at the InterContinental Dubai. Well priced, with excellent food."
"Serving an assortment of cuisines, the highlight of this beautiful restaurant is that it revolves, giving a nice tour of the city."
"Authentic Emirati cuisine, in the ambience of Dubai recreated from the 1960s."
"Japanese cuisine. Very high quality and very popular."
"Part of the Creek Golf Clubhouse. The waterfront restaurant right on Dubai Creek is very popular with residents."
"This is the Marriott's signature restaurant. Highly popular with Dubai residents."
"The essence interior of 400 club is a mix of Gothic and Baroque designs, famous for its vibrant lights and mix music of Arabic, RnB and house. It is always over-crowded during the weekends, especially local faithful crowds."
"Probably the most popular tea spots in town, especially Filli, who serves over 4,000 cups a day. Try the ''zaffrani chai '' (milk tea with saffron) or the ''doodh kadak'' (strong milk tea)."
"Small bar but wonderful views especially at sunset."
"Russia themed bar"
"Reception 24/7. Pool, football field, chill-out garden, A/C in the room, small bar fridge. It's located next to a mosque so morning prayers may wake you. Stadium metro station and bus stop just 100 m from hostel, Lulu Hyper Market shopping center and supermarket nearby. Free safety deposit boxes (hang on to your key as they have stiff $200 replacement fee). Clean rooms but unhelpful staff. You can walk there from Terminal 2. When you get out walk straight along 16th St to the end. It takes around 10 min. From terminal 1 or 3 you can take the metro to Union and transfer to Green Line (just take a train on the other side of the platform) to Stadium station (zone 1 fare, 2 AED). A taxi from terminal 1 or 3 costs around 40 AED. It is a branch of the UAE YHA, and only hostel in Dubai; thus booked up weeks ahead. WiFi cost extra 10 AED."
"Rooms from 158 AED."
"Rooms from 300 AED or US$80."
"Probably one of the cheapest place in town"
"free wifi, nice cafe"
"Another cheapy in the souk area"
"2 star place, a step up from the <200 dhs places"
"Rooms from US$152."
"Rooms start at 350 dhs, including breakfast."
"414 rooms and suites with views of the Persian Gulf. Host to Al Dawaar, Dubai's only revolving restaurant."
"498 rooms over 36 floors with views of the Dubai Creek and a 3800 sq m event centre. Attached to the Festival Centre shopping mall."
"Offers one, two and three-bedroom serviced suites with a choice between Creek and city views. Available for short or long stays."
"Waterfront location next to the Dubai Creek Golf and Yacht Club."
"Near Naif Square Bazaar."
"near Gold Souk, offers free internet stations and WiFi, which is very hard to find in Dubai."
"One of the last remaining pockets of Old Dubai, home to many reconstructed buildings in the traditional style. While information on the structures is slim here (see the museum in preference), the atmosphere is very evocative and there are plenty of delightful art galleries and cafes to explore."
"If you want to learn and understand the customs and traditions of UAE, this is the best place to go. The Centre hosts [http://www.cultures.ae/index.php/ouractivities/cultural-meals cultural meals] for between 70 and 95 AED, with discussion of UAE culture, customs and religion. They runs [http://www.cultures.ae/index.php/ouractivities/heritage-tours walking tours] through the Bastakiya district for 60 minutes (35 AED) and 90 minutes (55 AED), starting at either 9 or 10:30AM daily except Friday."
"A great place to hang out in the evening when the park is visited by people of different nationalities, all looking for calm place to enjoy the time. It has all the facilities of a modern park and is one of the best parks in Dubai."
"The only indoor dolphinarium in the Middle East offers live shows of dolphins and seals."
"A must-see for anyone interested in the social history of the Emirate (and indeed the country). Located in and under '''al-Fahidi fort'''. The fort itself has a few examples of the traditional reed houses and other artifacts, but isn't much to look at. The more interesting parts are the modern galleries beneath the fort, showcasing Dubai's history using the latest technology and culminating in a reconstructed souq from the pearling days, complete with authentic sights and sounds. It is quite fascinating to see the speed at which the transition from poor pearling village to modern metropolis occurred."
"Its large minaret is the imposing feature of this large mosque. It is popular for being quite close to a Hindu temple and one can see followers of both Islam and Hinduism gathering at the same place for prayers."
"Home to the open museums of the Heritage and Diving Villages, and the houses of the late Sheikhs Saeed Al-Maktoum and Juma Al-Maktoum."
"A very colourful and attractive tiled mosque; quite a contrast to the other much more plainly decorated mosques. Can be viewed from a carparking area off the north (Creek) side of the street."
"a historic building home to royal family members built in 1916 and now converted into a museum. It provides good glimpse to old infrastructure of Dubai."
"Another very historic building built in 1894 now converted into a museum and contains artefacts and images of the old town of Dubai. It was the residence of the Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, the former ruler of Dubai."
"Also known as the Textile Souk. A few of the shopkeepers can be quite forceful in trying to get you in to their shop."
"A 4-floor shopping mall housing more than 300 stores. It is one of the oldest, and still one of the largest, malls in Dubai, but has become less popular."
"A mall specializing in computers, laptops, computer parts and computer add-ons like monitors, VoIP phones, hard drives, etc. Prices aren't particularly low, even after haggling, and choices are limited (for example very few shops sell AMD hardware). There used to be an internet cafe here and it may return in 2014. Other malls in this area are also good for computers and computer equipment."
"A 3 story shopping mall housing more than 150 stores. One of the oldest malls."
"Includes Marks & Spencer, Goodies. Focus is almost entirely on luxury brands, jewellery and expensive boutiques. Many upmarket restaurants and bars, many of which serve alcohol. A luxury spa is attached to the complex. The Egypt-themed architecture, which includes quite beautiful stained-glass pyramids, is worth seeing."
"Gharana an Indian Restaurant in Holiday Inn Dubai – Al Barsha hotel brings you flavors of various spices and herbs with live entertainment."
"Set in a lovely garden courtyard in a restored house. Great place to take a breather with a cold drink and write some postcards. The sandwiches-and-salads menu is aimed squarely at tourists, but if you are sick of kebabs, they will cater to your salmon-avocado wrap and mango smoothie cravings. The ""Basta Special"" drink of mint and lemon is also excellent."
"Very nice and warm welcome given by the waiters. Food as good too. Not so expensive when compared to the quality of food."
"A Pakistani restaurant that provides cheap Pakistani & Indian food. Good for anyone with a spicy tooth."
"A Pakistani restaurant serving the country's most popular biryani."
"Indian and Pakistani food."
"This is an open air Iranian restaurant where one can sit in traditional machans (large bed-like seating) and enjoy a fine Iranian meal. The speciality is the mixed grill which is served with live coal. After the meal, you may smoke a traditional sheesha pipe. No alcohol served."
"Excellent Lebanese cuisine and ambience. In the cooler months the outdoor verandah is a pleasure. No alcohol served."
"Japanese cuisine, very popular with the Japanese expat community."
"Indian cuisine. Run by Asha Bosle. Good food but a little expensive"
"Fine dining restaurant, specialising in steak. A suitable venue for romantic dinners and family gatherings."
"With leisure amenities and friendly bar and nightclub, this restaurant bar is a comfortable and modest place during vacations. Loud night clubs music is played up until 3 am. Food is good with specialization in Indian food."
"It is a bar is a clean, quiet and bright venue with large variates of snacks options. Every wall is mounted with screen playing number of sports games. The interiors looks good with polished timber tables and benches all around and wall cladding."
"Excellent DJ, Live music and indian food. It is a Bollywood-themed glamorous bar and nightlife with elegant to casual laid backs and pleasant musical twists, mostly Indian music."
"Dance floor with excellent DJ. It is an expansive rooftop venue painted in pink surrounded with fake grass. An outdoor seating place with good food."

"Has Russian, Irish and Thai themed restaurants. Rooms from AED $180."
"A resort style hotel with extensive conference facilities."
"Attached to Wafi Mall. Egyptian themed."
"This huge sail-shaped hotel completed in 1999 is a symbol of Dubai and its ascent in the world. The self-proclaimed seven star hotel was the first icon of Dubai and still stands out on the skyline from its location on an artificial island 280&nbsp;m from the beach. Entry to the hotel is restricted to hotel guests and those with a restaurant reservation. A smart casual dress code applies but is not strictly enforced. Make restaurant reservations in advance."
"At 828m and 160 floors this is the world's tallest structure by a long shot, over 300m taller than the previous contender in Taipei. The observation deck at the 124th floor is the second highest in the world after the Shanghai World Financial centre. Dominating the Dubai skyline, the tower houses a hotel and a Las Vegas-inspired fountain system. The visitors' entrance is at the lower ground floor of '''Dubai Mall'''. Although the tour is called '''At the Top''', it isn't! While the observation deck is the highest open deck in the world, at 452m it's just over halfway up the tower itself. Console yourself with the knowledge that most of the rest of the tower consists of service areas and the view below looks suitably ant-like."
"At 270m (900 ft) in length and sporting a jet that shoots water up to 150m (500 ft), it is the world's largest dancing fountain and one with a very enticing display - a definite must-see. It's most easily accessed via the Dubai Mall. There are private entranceways from the Burj Khalifa if you're staying there."
"The Dubai Marina is to be the popular nightlife area of Dubai in the future. This multi-billion development is designed for tourists and water sport. The bars and cafés along the marina are popular gathering points for families and younger people. Most restaurants offer shisha and oriental food but food chains are fast entering too. The ""Marina Walk"" along the yachts is especially popular on Fridays and Saturdays. Yacht agencies offer services to explore the coastal region and Palm Islands."
"An outdoor zoo near the beach. Because of the extreme temperatures during summer, there are plans to bring the zoo indoors. It is not worth visiting, because of the small number and variety of animals. Housing conditions are appalling; animals are in cages too small for them to take more than a few steps, and are frustrated and bored."
"Dubai is known for its great beaches and this one is the best. It's the most popular and busiest beach of the country. Expect to see swimmers in bikinis and ladies in abaya cloaks; this beach truly encapsulates the Westernisation of Dubai culture."
"The largest mosque in the city, and a wonderful example of Islamic architecture. It was built in the medieval Fatimid tradition with the interior decorated with elaborate Arabic calligraphy. It is one of few mosques in the city open for visits by non-Muslims; the [http://www.cultures.ae/ Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding] conducts special tours for non-Muslims to help promote understanding of Islam. Guided tours are available on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday beginning at 10:00, followed by a question-and-answer session. The mosque is an especially great place to visit in the evening when it's dramatically illuminated by floodlights."
"A restored traditional Emirati-style two story building used as a summer residence by Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, one of the founders of UAE, and father of the present ruler of Dubai."
"The Palm islands are the best symbols of the boom and bust construction cycles in Dubai. The ""oldest"" Palm called Palm Jumeirah is completed and is host to the gigantic Atlantis Hotel on its top. Several marinas, hotels and condo are along the palm leaves. The development of the other two Palms will depend on the financial situation of the construction business but someday Dubai will have the three largest artificial islands in the world on its coastline."
"A beautiful planned park and one of the oldest parks in Dubai. It is a favourite for sports enthusiasts, and many visitors enjoy playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Children love playing games in the video arcade, or riding the ferris wheel and bumper cars. The park even has a maze to wander through. Barbeques and picnic areas are available for those who want to make a day of it. It has lakes where you can take a boat ride and a hill that offers panoramic views of this beautiful lush green park and the gigantic Dubai skyline."
"The best and most popular park of town, it gives a different glimpse of the desert and hot Dubai."
"Atlantis-themed but Arabian-styled resort on the artificial island of The Palm. Has a huge water park with plenty of thrilling water slides, housed inside a large shopping area with plenty of places to eat and drink."
"Dubai has a snow skiing centre in the Mall of the Emirates, offering both skiing and snowboarding. The slope is quite large for an indoor area. All equipment is available for hire. Although it is -4°C inside, you do not need to bring a jacket because they supply pretty much everything except gloves and a hat (which you can buy right there). A 2 hour pass costs AED180 plus AED20 for a locker."
"The perfect place for the entire family to spend a day as well as being a great way to beat the heat and enjoy the day away from the bustle of the city. Located close to the hotels and resorts of Jumeriah Beach, the park has water rides, slides, and a lagoon that is hidden away. You'll enjoy waterfalls, out of the way swimming holes, and a tidal pool."
"The largest mall in the world, it opened in November 2008. It has over 1,200 shops of brand names from all over the world. It contains an indoor ice rink and indoor aquarium. It is right next door to the Burj Khalifah, and the visitors' entrance to the Burj Khalifa is located at the lower ground floor of the Mall. It houses the Dubai Aquarium (which you can dive tours in) and 1,200 shops for everything. The food court on the lower floor is spectacular in its variety. It's a good place to watch the water games of the Dubai fountain, which plays at night. It is breathtaking, so take time and pick your points of interest."
"Part of the Emirates Tower Hotel complex. The shops here match the hotel, very high class, plus a Starbucks. Lipton café has free Wi-Fi. Restaurants and bars all serve alcohol. Quite a popular nightlife spot, with bars and nightclubs and it is considered the most expensive mall in Dubai."
"It was largest shopping mall outside of North America until the Dubai Mall opened in 2008. Over 200 shops, cinemas, plus the Ski Centre. Has many international high street chains as well as luxury brand stores, including Harvey Nichols. Many restaurants and cafés, though cafés tend to be much more crowded than at other malls. It's attached to a Kempinski hotel, which has restaurants licensed to serve alcohol that are accessible from the mall. Very large Carrefour hypermarket attached, next to the Kempinski Hotel. Arabian/Middle Eastern souvenir shops upstairs. It's known for Ski Dubai and it other spectacular attractions. There are all High Street shops around and is very popular with families."
"Mercato (Italian for ''market'') is the only Renaissance-themed shopping mall in the Middle East. It captures Italian, French and Spanish flavors and artistic characteristics, playing host to regular fairs and festivals from each country. Mercato provides a unique shopping experience, the best in international entertainment and popular brand names like Virgin Megastore, Top Shop, Mango and Hugo Boss; Mercato is simply ''The Good Life.'' It houses a big Spinneys Supermarket, a 7 screen Grand Cinema, a Starbucks, and mouth watering restaurants such as Bella Donna who have a balcony overlooking the sea that cannot be missed."
"Includes 75 shops, numerous bars, restaurants and cafés, a nightclub, theatre. More expensive and targeted directly at tourists than other, general malls where residents go. Most bars and restaurants are licensed for alcohol. Nice to wander through as it has been designed to resemble a ""traditional"" souq, but with the modern comforts of air conditioning. Lots of souvenir-type shops."
"With a bright, open and spacious atmosphere, it is a place to shop, relax and casually dine at a wide selection of eateries like Sumo Sushi, Cafe Ceramique, La Cafette by Carpe Diem and Simply Healthy. It also houses an extensive range of ladies' beauty outlets like the Nail Station, Paris Gallery, Kaya Skin Care Clinic, Wax Lounge and SOS Salon."
"a small community much resembling a town, its streets are rowed by textile shops notably opposite the Satwa Mosque ending to the opposite of Satwa clinic. Most of the people flock to Satwa for their textiles, you might sometimes catch offers and discounts but if you don't do so try bargaining the price, this is what most locals do, even if you're a tourist convince the salesman to give you a discount, bargain till you get the lowest price available. Not only is Satwa a hub for textile shops; some tailoring shops on the corners are also found if you want a dress made as soon as possible after purchasing the raw materials. Raw silk might also be available in some shops. Because of the row of textile shops, it might be Dubai's version of Little India and Little Manila as many Indians reside in this district as well as Filipinos."

"A multifaceted public art project helmed by architect David Lagé, the idea behind Artfarms is to use unique, eye-catching installations created by members of the local art community to help establish a sense of place in the midst of some of Buffalo's most blighted environments, as well as to foster cultural awareness among the residents of marginal neighborhoods. Though Artfarms' temporary works might pop up pretty much anywhere on the East Side, their two main installations can be found at the '''Michigan Riley Farm''' in Cold Spring and the '''Wilson Street Urban Farm''' in Broadway-Fillmore (see the ""Buy"" section for more on those). Respectively, these are the site of '''''Tree''''', a functional sculpture by Michael Beitz that consists of a picnic table designed in a curvilinear, branching form suggestive of a tree, and '''''Fall and Rise''''', a delicate-looking, roughly dome-shaped sculpture of curving metal rods and wire mesh that serves as a hothouse for the farm's more delicate plants, with the walls also used as lattices for climbing vines."
"Artspace Buffalo is a homegrown artists' colony comprised of sixty loft apartments-cum-art studios that are home to some of the foremost emerging names in the Buffalo art community, as well as an expansive gallery space that displays works by Artspace residents and other artists from Buffalo and around the region. With a full schedule of exhibitions all year long, you never know quite what's going to be on at the Artspace Buffalo Gallery: works displayed there span a wide variety of media, from traditional formats like painting, sculpture and photography to offbeat exhibitions of collage and jewel art. There are even musical performances from time to time."
"Located on the top floor of '''The Guild @ 980''' — the headquarters of and sometime retail store belonging to the local purveyor of upcycles building materials, '''ReUse Action''' — is an art gallery with a purview unique to the Buffalo area, and while the temorary exhibitions they put on are not what you would call ""frequent"", if you happen to be in town for one, you're in for a real treat. At the Gallery @ the Guild, the focus is on so-called ""restoration art"": found objects from some of the same soon-to-be-demolished buildings where the warehouse store downstairs sources its merchandise are repurposed and reimagined in magnificent ways, displaying the timeworn beauty of the old craftsmanship."
"By most people's definition, what's housed in this repurposed Civil War-era convent on a residential street in the Fruit Belt is not an art gallery. Rather, Locust Street Art is best-known for offering free, professionally-taught art and photography lessons for children and adults; it's been doing so since 1959, when local art teacher Molly Bethel began giving informal painting lessons to neighborhood children in her living room. Locust Street Art has fostered the formative talents of many successful artists over the years, and has been recognized as a winner of the New York Governor's Award in 1985, as well as by the Harvard Graduate School of Education for excellence as an educational resource for economically disadvantaged communities. The best way to see the fruits of this effort are during the art shows and fundraisers Locust Street Art holds on an occasional basis, featuring the work of current students as well as other area artists."
"The massive old factory building in Fillmore-Leroy that was once '''Trico Plant #2''', built in 1915 by the pioneering windshield wiper manufacturer and later used by Ford Motors to build airplanes during World War II, was reborn in 1991 as the Tri-Main Center. Intended as a mixed-use facility for offices and light industrial concerns, the building instead became an epicenter for the nascent East Side arts community, with studios, galleries, and cultural institutions snapping up a disproportionate share of the space. The prominent presence of the arts here is celebrated with '''Trimania''', a huge biannual festival featuring live music, performances and art shows on all five floors of the building, as well as '''Fourth Fridays''', a smaller monthly open house where studios and galleries display artists' works. The Tri-Main Center contains:"
"With about two dozen artists-in-residence working in a diversity of different media and representative of a broad cross-section of the local arts community, the Buffalo Arts Studio provides artists from Buffalo and beyond a venue to exhibit their works — either as part of the permanent collection or through the temporary exhibitions they hold frequently — as well as affordable studio space in one of the area's premier up-and-coming arts facilities. As well, the Buffalo Arts Studio's mission to advance awareness and enjoyment of art among the community at large manifests itself in the form of art classes, mural paintings and other public art projects offered to local citizens."
"Moved to the Tri-Main Center in 2014 from its former home in Allentown, Mundo Images is run by Ann Peterson, a professional photographer, language instructor, and world traveler whose mission is to enrich the world through photography, educate young people, and raise awareness of environmental issues. In addition to the small gallery where works by Ann as well as other artists are displayed, Mundo Images also produces, and sells at local stores, greeting cards printed locally on chlorine-free FSC Certified paper, which promotes environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of forests."
"Located in Olmsted's '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the Buffalo Museum of Science is located in a lovely building built in 1929 by the prominent Buffalo architectural firm of Esenwein & Johnson. The emphasis of the Buffalo Museum of Science is on natural and physical sciences; items from its 700,000+ piece collection of specimens and artifacts, encompassing almost every conceivable aspect of the anthropology, botany, entomology, mycology, paleontology and zoology of Western New York and elsewhere, are on display in the Museum's galleries. The Buffalo Museum of Science also boasts interactive science studios and a National Geographic 3D Cinema, and operates the '''Tifft Nature Preserve''', 264 acres (105ha) of reclaimed industrial land in South Buffalo."
"Operated by James Sandoro, a former curator of exhibits at the '''Buffalo History Museum''' and a lifelong collector of historic artifacts, the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum draws 10,000 visitors per year to their museum complex in a historic neighborhood just east of downtown, despite minimal advertising. As one might expect, the exhibits at the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum run heavily towards antique cars and automotive memorabilia, especially Pierce-Arrows, the luxury sedans produced in Buffalo in the early 20th century to which the museum owes its name. The museum's ''pièce de résistance'' debuted in June 2014: Buffalo's seventh and newest Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building, a filling station constructed according to an original 1927 blueprint which Wright intended for the corner of Michigan Avenue and Cherry Street a short distance north of here."
"The Buffalo Fire Historical Society Museum is located in Lovejoy, a blue-collar neighborhood that is home to many Buffalo firefighters. This modest-sized building houses an amazingly extensive collection of antique fire trucks, apparatus and other artifacts, as well as historic photographs and exhibits related to the history of the Buffalo Fire Department. The museum's mission also encompasses educating the public about fire safety and prevention, as well as firefighting as a career."
"The Colored Musicians' Club is a designated Buffalo Landmark, and easily the most storied jazz club in the city — founded in 1918 as the social club of the all-black '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''', it almost immediately became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of Buffalo-area ragtime and jazz bands as well as the world-famous elite performers of the genre. The club continues to function as a venue for live jazz, but it also contains a museum with a range of artifacts and exhibits that detail the history of the club and of jazz music in Buffalo."
"With a history linked closely to the railroad industry that was so prominent in Buffalo at the turn of the century, the neighborhood of Lovejoy is nicknamed ""Iron Island"" because it is surrounded by railroad tracks on all four sides. The Iron Island Museum was opened in 2000 by the '''Iron Island Preservation Society''' and is dedicated to retelling the history of Lovejoy with a particular emphasis on the railroads that have shaped its identity. Formerly a funeral home, the Iron Island Museum's reputation for ghost sightings has attracted the attention of paranormal researchers from around the region and further afield, as well as the television shows ""Ghost Lab"" and ""Ghost Hunters"". Accordingly, overnight ghost hunts, conducted periodically by reservation, are a popular offering of the Iron Island Museum."
"The Nash House Museum is located just east of downtown: one block from Michigan Avenue, the birthplace of Buffalo's African-American community in the mid-19th Century. This Nationally Registered Historic Place was once the home of Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until his retirement in 1953 — was a personal friend of such nationally-known luminaries of black history as Booker T. Washington and Adam Clayton Powell, and was instrumental in the founding of the local chapter of the NAACP and in advocacy on behalf of Buffalo's African-American citizenry in the years before the Civil Rights Movement. Today, his house is open as a museum that contains engaging exhibits and archival records chronicling the history of Buffalo's African-American community. Also, the house itself is architecturally significant as a particularly good example of the wood-frame, partially prefabricated ""Buffalo doubles"" that were built here by the thousands around the turn of the century."
"The crown jewel of the East Side's parks is its representative in the roster of Buffalo's Olmsted network: the site of the '''Buffalo Museum of Science''', the '''Humboldt Basin''', a handsome rose garden, walking paths, playgrounds, picnic shelters, and pleasant greenery. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was the first of Buffalo's Olmsted parks to open to the public, in 1872: called ""The Parade"" at first, it was designed to host military drills and other large gatherings, with the brightly colored '''Parade House''' as its centerpiece and '''Humboldt Parkway''', the most magnificent of all the Olmsted parkways in Buffalo, linking it to the rest of the system. But the Parade was far from any military installations Buffalo had; to the consternation of Olmsted, the park instead became a gathering place for the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed his quiet pastoral vision for it with raucous oompah bands that played at the Parade House and neighborhood scamps damaging the grass with their roughhousing. To the rescue came Olmsted's two sons, the successors in his firm; their 1896 redesign curved Fillmore Avenue to discourage through traffic and added the Humboldt Basin, a lovely '''Lily Pond''', and formal gardens. The Olmsted brothers renamed the park Humboldt Park, a name that was changed yet again in 1977 to its current one. Sadly, like most of the other elements of Buffalo's park system, the integrity of the Olmsteds' original design of the park sustained considerable damage over the course of the 20th Century: the Parade House is long-gone, part of its west edge was sacrificed in 1929 for the science museum, and there's a basketball court where the Lily Pond used to be. But the greatest indignity happened in 1960, when Humboldt Parkway was torn asunder to make way for the '''Kensington Expressway''' ''(see infobox at right)''. The '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy''' is hard at work righting those wrongs: the Humboldt Basin has already been renovated and reopened, the restoration of the '''Shelter House''' is ongoing, and plans are afoot to recreate the Lily Pond."
"The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin is a five-acre (2 ha) water feature of several functions: in the summer it serves as a ""splash pad"" where neighborhood kids can cool off and frolic underneath fountains of cool water that jet upwards from sprinklers embedded in the ground, in the winter it's an outdoor ice rink, and in the spring and fall it's a pleasant, peaceful reflecting pool. The Humboldt Basin was reconstructed and reopened in 2013 by the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy'''; originally, it was part of the Olmsted brothers' 1896 redesign of what was then called Humboldt Park, an immense wading pool with a sand and clay bottom (later replaced with concrete) that had been dry and abandoned since the 1980s."
"Designed by sculptor John Wilson, the Martin Luther King Tribute Plaza was unveiled in October 1983, six years after the city made good on its longstanding promise to neighborhood residents to rename the erstwhile Humboldt Park in honor of the civil rights leader that's depicted in this eight-foot (2.5m) bronze bust portrait. The figure is sculpted in a somewhat idealized way; in the words of the artist, it was intended to ""sum up the larger-than-life ideas"" of Dr. King and capture his ""inner meaning"" rather than simply as a lifelike representation. Underneath the bust, on the side of the low stone wall that serves as its pedestal, is a bas-relief engraving of Dr. King at the podium at his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech."
"Hidden in plain sight on a quiet pedestrian walkway right next to the science museum is Martin Luther King, Jr. Park's rose garden: a small, cozy, tree-shaded oasis recently restored by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy where a variety of roses and other flowering plants bloom in season."
"Dyngus Day is a traditional Polish holiday that falls on the Monday after Easter; on this day, young boys are known to ""slap"" girls who catch their eye with pussywillows or squirt them with water guns in a courtship ritual called ''śmigus''. Today, Buffalo hosts the largest organized Dyngus Day celebration in the world — including Poland, where the festival has largely been forgotten. Since the mid-2000s, Buffalo's annual Dyngus Day celebration has once again been held in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore at the grand old '''New York Central Terminal''', a majestic old Art Deco train station that is yet another of Buffalo's architectural masterpieces that is undergoing extensive restoration. After the Dyngus Day Parade through the streets of Broadway-Fillmore opens the festivities, traditional Polish food and (even more popularly) drink are served in the old dining room, with polka bands attracting revelers to the dance floor. Celebrations are also held at '''St. Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr Church''' (the so-called ""Mother Church of Polonia""), the '''Adam Mickiewicz Library''', and the many Polish-owned bars and taverns that continue to soldier on in the old neighborhood."
"Presented in mid-April in odd-numbered years, Trimania is a raucous evening of ""art, music and mischief"" at the '''Tri-Main Center''' on Main Street. Not only do artists and other businesses open their studios and display their latest masterwork to the public, but all six floors of this old WWI-era factory building are transformed for an evening into a giant freeform performance space, where live bands, DJs, comedians, dancers, poets, and performance artists vie for your attention in a lively multimedia art party that doesn't wind down until well after midnight. Drinks flow freely, the hungry can choose from a multitude of food trucks and other vendors, and all proceeds go to benefit the '''Buffalo Arts Studio'''."
"Springing from a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the state of Texas on June 19, 1865, Juneteenth is celebrated in the black community of the U.S. today as a holiday that signifies African-American pride and cultural heritage. Today, each June 19th sees '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' host the nation's third-largest Juneteenth festival. Beginning with a parade that proceeds westward down Genesee Street from Moselle Street to the park, Buffalo's Juneteenth festival is a lively two-day celebration that includes demonstrations of traditional African and African-American art, music and dance, ethnic foods, crafts and wares, and activities for children."
"Held on the final two consecutive Sundays of June behind the '''Buffalo Museum of Science''' at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the Masten District Jazz Festival is as homegrown as it gets: in a downhome, grassroots ambience you'll catch locally-based performers and bands whose playing features the distinct flavor of Buffalo jazz music (including James ""Pappy"" Martin, who founded the festival in 1996 and whose Love Supreme Jazz Orchestra plays every year). As well, a sprinkling of nationally-famous jazz performers stop by occasionally, plus other types of music (for instance, on the bill of the 2014 festival was Alassane Sarr, an African dancer and fourth-generation ''griot'' originally from Senegal). There are eight performances in all: four on each festival day."
"The newest in a growing list of festivals celebrating Buffalo's long-neglected jazz history, the late-July Queen City Jazz Festival sees a slate of mainly local jazz artists take the stage for an evening at the historic '''Colored Musicians Club''' on Broadway. There are two stages — the main one indoors as well as a refreshing outdoor performance space — that host about fifteen acts combined, and the adjacent '''Colored Musicians Club Museum''' opens during the festival with reduced admission rates."
"Though the '''Pine Grill''' closed some thirty years ago, the memories of the halcyon days of that Jefferson Avenue nightspot — when jazz greats like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and Dizzy Gillespie played to packed houses — are sweet enough to have inspired the '''African-American Cultural Center''' to launch an annual jazz festival that bears its name. Much like the '''Masten District Jazz Festival''', concerts take place at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' on consecutive Sunday evenings: in this case, the first two in August, beginning at 4PM sharp. The first week features nationally-famous acts, while the second week is all about the local jazz scene that's still going strong in Buffalo — and best of all, performances often feature the same old Hammond B3 organ that was once the centerpiece of the Pine Grill. Also, unlike the Masten District festival, food vendors are on hand (though you're welcome to BYO as well)."
"''Dożynki'' is a traditional harvest festival of rural Poland that goes back centuries, and since 1980, it's been celebrated in Buffalo over three days in mid-August at '''Corpus Christi Church''' on Clark Street. Dożynki is has grown into one of the largest annual festivals in Polonia; appropriately enough for its harvest theme, Polish cuisine is the star of the show: chefs vie annually for the coveted prize of ""Buffalo's Best Pierogi"", and a special ""Polish pizza"" is trotted out just for the occasion. As well, there's live polka music, folk dancers, guided tours of the church, raffles, and the ever-popular crowning of ""Miss Dożynki"", as well as a special Harvest Mass that kicks off the final day of the festivities."
"Canisius College is home to seventeen athletic teams whose games are huge draws for Buffalonians. The ""Griffs"" play Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference basketball at the {{marker|type=do|name=Koessler Athletic Center|lat=42.920964|long=-78.857466}} on Main Street at East Delavan Avenue, while outdoor sports like soccer and lacrosse are held at the {{marker|type=do|name=Demske Athletic Complex|lat=42.921329|long=-78.855885}} a short distance away. Canisius' hockey team, a member of the Atlantic Hockey Conference, plays at the '''HarborCenter''' downtown. Tickets — which are affordably priced at $12 for hockey games, $10 for basketball, $7 for lacrosse, $5 for women's basketball, and free for all other sports — can be purchased at the ticket office at the Koessler Center on weekdays from 10AM-4PM."
"Founded in 2009, FC Buffalo is a member of the National Premier Soccer League. After spending the previous two years at '''Canisius College''''s '''Demske Athletic Complex''', as of the 2015 season the team has moved back to its original home at {{marker|type=do|name=All-High Stadium|lat=42.943069|long=-78.831007}} in Fillmore-Leroy. Nicknamed ""the Blitzers"" (in honor of the locally born CNN anchor and FC Buffalo fan, Wolf Blitzer), FC Buffalo's dedication to the well-being of the Buffalo community is exemplified in their motto, ""For Our City"". Tickets are reasonably priced."
"In winter months, the beautiful reflecting pool/splash pad at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' is frozen over and opened to the public for old-fashioned pond skating. The rink is open on a weather-dependent basis; for ice conditions, call ☎ +1 716 838-1249, ext. 17."
"The Paul Robeson Theatre is the oldest African-American theatre in Buffalo, founded in 1968 and located at the {{marker|type=do|name=African-American Cultural Center|lat=42.911904|long=-78.859778}}. The 130-seat theater is located inside the cultural center's headquarters on Masten Avenue in Buffalo's East Side, and features a handful of productions each year with an especial focus on the African-American experience. Among the famous personalities that have performed on the Paul Robeson Theatre's stage include Ossie Davis, Phylicia Rashad, and Woodie King, Jr."
"Aside from being Western New York's premiere Polish-American social club as well as home to both Buffalo's oldest Polish library and one of its largest '''Dyngus Day''' celebrations, the historic {{marker|type=do|name=Adam Mickiewicz Library and Dramatic Circle|lat=42.890083|long=-78.839391}} is also where this avant-garde black box theater has been operated since 2000 by local impresarios Dan Shanahan and Melissa Meola. Torn Space Theater's production team draws on multiple different artistic media and disciplines, such as music and visual art, to present lively, imaginative, and truly original dramatic works by auteurs from around the local region, as well as innovative reimaginations of well-known existing works like Eugene O'Neill's ''The Hairy Ape''. In addition to the performances at the Mickiewicz Library, Torn Space is unique among the Buffalo theatre community in producing site-specific works designed specifically to be performed in iconic Buffalo settings such as '''Canalside''' and '''Silo City'''. And, around Halloween, their annual '''Prom of the Dead''' art and music bash packs the house at the '''Dnipro Center''' on Genesee Street."
"Most of the time, ""CPG's"" is a cozy, sedate Main Street bar & grill situated about midway between '''Canisius College''' and University Heights, serving well-prepared comfort food and cocktails to the over-25 crowd. What it's best known for, though, are the sizzling blues shows that happen every Friday and Saturday night, where local combos like Dive House Union, the Jony James Band, and the Heavenly Chillbillies strut their stuff at the center of the Buffalo blues universe. Other genres like soul, funk, jazz and reggae crop up from time to time too, and if there's no band onstage when you visit you can still get your fix with the Internet jukebox and its encyclopedic selection of blues numbers."
"Located on Broadway just outside downtown, this former home of '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''' (and, before that, the '''Charlie Zifle Shoe Store''') has done double-duty as a renowned jazz club since not much later than the union chapter's foundation in 1918, made necessary when '''Local 43''' voted to bar local African-American musicians from membership. With jazz music all the rage among the black community at the time, the union's second-floor performance space became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of local ragtime and jazz bands after their workday was finished, or on Sundays, to see them rehearse in the practice space the union provided free to its members. Soon enough, it was a venue in its own right, playing host to world-famous luminaries like Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton, and more. The tradition continues today: the Colored Musicians' Club hosts big-band concerts on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons followed by a legendary open jam session in the evening. And if you're interested in the club's storied history, there's also an attached museum ''(q.v.)'' where you can learn all you've ever wanted to know about Buffalo's jazz scene of yesterday and today."
"The Foundry is a former industrial workshop in Masten Park that now serves as an incubator for a wide range of grassroots small businesses, as well as a venue for various community-centered events and happenings. One of those events is '''Roc da Mic''', a monthly showcase for Buffalo's underground hip-hop community. On the last Thursday of each month, local MCs, DJs, breakdancers, poets, and other artists converge to strut their stuff in a freeform open-mic extravaganza."
"Yes, ""CASH FOR GOLD"" is proclaimed loudly and proudly on the signs that adorn the front of this humble storefront, but Bailey Jewelry is more than just another sleazy old-gold broker. On the contrary, the selection of 10-karat, 14-karat and silver jewelry here is impressive indeed. As is the rule on the East Side, the merchandise here runs heavily toward urban and hip-hop styles: big, chunky hoop earrings, pendants, and diamond rings and watches abound on the shelves here. If you don't like what you see, Bailey Jewelry's owner will even custom-design a piece just for you. Prices are fair for what you get, but what you get is of surprisingly high quality, so come prepared to spend a little bit. If jewelry repair is what you're after, they do that too — again at fair prices."
"In business on Bailey Avenue since 2009, the main stock in trade at Beauty Plus is a range of wholesale beauty salon equipment and supplies, as well as a great selection of wigs, in many cases made of real human hair. However, there's a wide range of street-style jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing on the walls and shelves of this crowded shop at the heart of the Kensington-Bailey business district. Beauty Plus is also an authorized dealer of Dickies workwear."
"Carrie's High Fashions is a small place that's not particularly easy to find: look for the small ""Hats & Shoes"" sign in the window next to '''Jackson Hewitt Tax Service''', on the east side of Bailey Avenue. Hats and shoes are indeed the cornerstones of the merchandise at Carrie's, the selection of which comprises resale vintage items as well as vintage-inspired new pieces. There's elegant, high-fashion ladies' hats perfect for church on Sunday, and beautiful dresses in bold yet refined colors and styles."
"Since 2005, City Fashion's stylish, elegant ladieswear has been attracting folks from all over the city and beyond — folks come from as far as Toronto to browse the great selection of quality items on the racks. if you're planning a special occasion such as a graduation, prom or wedding, you're in luck. The service here is friendly and helpful, and they do tailoring and alterations as well."
"A huge store with a huge selection, Fashion City's inventory goes above and beyond the streetwise urban styles you see in other Bailey Avenue clothes shops: you'll find plenty of that, but also a healthy admixture of clothes in a more traditional, even preppy, aesthetic. The interior of the store is decorated in a brash and vibrant scheme, highlighted by a loud black-and-white checkered tile floor, and it's where you'll find a wide range of name-brand clothes for men and women on racks, shelves, even hanging from the rafters. You'll find sweats, hoodies, jeans, t-shirts, baseball caps, flannels, bubble jackets, shoes and boots (there's a huge wall given over to Timberlands), and much more. Fashion City is also an authorized dealer of Dickies work apparel."
"Ladies' fashions are the main attraction at this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip, and value for your money is what sets it apart from the competition. Koko's is a clothing store designed for the professional, no-nonsense urban lady on the go: eschewing the loud, brash, somewhat tacky streetwise styles you'll find elsewhere, the clothes here are sophisticated, understated, and upscale while retaining just the right degree of sass. And the prices can't be beat. At Koko's plus sizes abound, there's a great selection of shoes — and if you're a Buffalo Bills fan in town during football season, you're in luck, as this is when they clear out space on the slaes floor for a ''huge'' variety of Bills jerseys, hoodies, jackets, men's and women's shirts, and (for the most diehard fans) vintage-style Zubaz pants."
"Lucky's may not look like much from the outside, but there's a huge selection of different stuff inside that goes above and beyond ""The Latest Fashion and Beauty"" that the sign outside touts. The front of the store is given over to a decent selection of polo shirts, men's and women's T-shirts, jeans, and workwear, while in back you have bath products, body oils, wigs, hair extensions, and other such items. Finally, this jack-of-all-trades shop even sells, unlocks and repairs cell phones — a variety of brands and plans are offered. No matter what brings you here, though, you can be assured of friendly and helpful service. Lucky's also has a second location on Sycamore Street in Broadway-Fillmore that deals in cell phones only."
"""Don't be predictable"", exhorts the motto emblazoned on the front of this humble storefront, and true to its word, One of a Kind Fashions offers up an inventory that's different from your average Bailey Avenue urban clothing boutique: the selection here is decidedly upscale, without sacrificing any of the streetwise style of its neighbors. The retail space here is split into two levels: in front there is streetwear and accessories like watches, belts, jewelry, handbags and shoes whose aesthetic tends toward the loud and outlandish; walk up a few steps in back to find a range of more conservative dresses, skirts, and tops perfect for a night on the town. Furthering the balancing act between elegance and sass is the interior, brightly lit and decorated with stylish minimalism yet with delightfully gaudy accents here and there like mirrored walls."
"There's lots of urban clothes crammed into this ample, warmly decorated strip-mall boutique, particularly menswear: t-shirts, jeans, hoodies and more. Belts, shoes, boots and other accessories come in bold, bright colors and really make a statement. The folks at Swag also fix broken mobile phones, iPads and iPods."
"Established in 1929 by brothers Morris and Herman Cohen and still run by the same family, United Men's Fashions is by far the oldest operating business in the neighborhood. Over the years it's expanded its footprint into all three of the adjacent houses at the corner of Midway Avenue, cementing its place at the center of the Ken-Bailey retail universe. ""The clothes make the man"" is a maxim that's oft-repeated here, and United Men's Fashions lives those words out with their extensive selection of menswear: a high-quality array of suit jackets, dress shirts and pants, tuxedos and other formalwear, sweaters, hats, and men's accessories such as ties, cufflinks, lapel pins, and belts occupy the shelves here. Despite sporting a style that's sometimes flashy, with bright, offbeat colors to choose from, what's sold here is classy and sophisticated: these pieces would be much more at home in a high-end men's shop in New York or Los Angeles than on the East Side, as attested to by the thriving online mail-order business these folks do to homes all over the United States. Prices are not half bad, either, and the icing on the cake is superlatively friendly, attentive and helpful customer service of the kind that makes it easy to understand how the business has lasted this long."
"Since 1992, owner Kim Young has operated this urban fashion boutique, stocking street gear and accessories for both men and women at the heart of the Bailey strip. The styles you'll find at Young Fashions are pretty much in line with the standard set by its neighboring competitors, but the selection is decent, and they're also an authorized seller of Dickies brand workwear."
"If you've been to its big sister on Niagara Street, you'll know what to expect from the East Side satellite location of An Chau: crowded aisles stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Compared to its West Side counterpart, this place is smaller but also cleaner and less chaotic and claustrophobic, with shelves crowded with all manner of sauces, oils, pickles, snacks, and packaged groceries. The far-side aisles are lined with coolers and freezers that contain frozen meats and fresh exotic produce from tamarind to mung beans to Korean pears to white beech mushrooms, and there's a small counter in the back for fresh meat cut to order. One difference at the Bailey Avenue location is there's also a small range of Caribbean foodstuffs there, including johnnycake mix. If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, An Chau has you covered — and if you just got done tucking into a bowl of ''pho'' down the street at '''Pho 99''' and have the itch to try making some at home, they have frozen meatballs and even packaged instant soup mix. A word of warning, though: check the sell-by dates, as An Chau is known to occasionally keep expired or near-expired items on the shelves."
"Owned and operated by Paul Diamond since 1980, Bailey Furniture is one of the longest-standing businesses in the area. The name of the game here is used and antique furniture, along with some new furniture. There's a wide selection to browse through at this crowded little shop, especially of dining room furniture, which seems to be a particular specialty. As the inventory is sourced mostly from used goods people sell to the shop, quality (and value for your money) varies widely from item to item, and the shopping experience is akin to a giant estate sale. Still, like any estate sale, there are bargains to be had at Bailey Furniture for those who are willing to hunt for them. It might be worthwhile to call ahead if you're thinking of stopping in: the staff has a habit of adhering rather loosely to their posted opening hours."
"A 20-year veteran of the local music industry, Civic Davis has been selling the latest in R&B, hip-hop, reggae, gospel, jazz, and blues albums in this small shop since 1996. Browse through the selection of CDs and cassettes in the stylishly decorated sales floor overlooked by a huge fishbowl. DVDs of blockbuster Hollywood movies are available, as well as — interestingly — a range of spa and beauty care products."
"Located just off the Jefferson Avenue exit of the '''Kensington Expressway''' at the edge of the Fruit Belt, Big Basha Central has been ""your one-stop shop"" since 1995 for clothing and gear in a wide variety of urban styles: T-shirts, hoodies and jeans from brands like Rocawear, Black Label, and Coogi, designer sneakers and Timberland boots, jackets, and ladieswear too. There's also a bodega-cum-beauty supply shop, '''Big Basha Market''', across the street."
"Besides being a wholesale distributor of brand-name and designer leather coats, jackets, winter wear, caps, and t-shirts, Park Avenue Coat Company also has several retail locations, including one just outside downtown on the Near East Side. Here, in a no-frills warehouse environment, you can find some of the absolute cheapest outerwear in town: not only do you still pay wholesale prices for anything that's on the racks, but Park Avenue also sells ""slightly irregular"" merchandise direct from the manufacturers at an even steeper discount. If you want, say, a licensed Starter jacket of your favorite NFL, NBA, NHL, or NCAA sports team, but only have $15 to spend, this is the place for you. New merchandise arrives weekly, and prices tend to be especially good around February and March when they're clearing out their winter gear — but sadly, Park Avenue's massive retail floor is not very well staffed by salespeople, so you mostly have to fend for yourself to find what you're looking for."
"A lot bigger inside than what it looks like from the parking lot, this Korean-owned footwear destination at the '''Jefferson-Utica Plaza''' in Cold Spring carries a decent selection of shoes — they're a licensed dealer of Timberland boots as well as Converse products. Oddly enough, Sneakertown also carries a modest array of urban-styled jewelry."
"Contrary to popular misconception, the Buffalo Brewing Company is ''not'' Buffalo's first nanobrewery (that title technically goes to '''Community Beer Works'''), but their pint-sized facility on the edge of the Ellicott District is certainly more in line with what most folks think of when they hear that term — Buffalo Brewing has a production capacity of two barrels per day, a pittance next to what CBW churns out on the West Side. Owner John Domres is a consummate beer aficionado — he started homebrewing almost as soon as he could legally drink — and by the time he purchased this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue and set about renovating it for its new purpose, this part of town had already staked its claim as epicenter of Buffalo's spanking-new artisanal brewing and distilling industry, with about a half-dozen like-minded neighbors in the nearby Old First Ward and Larkinville. The core of Buffalo Brewing's repertoire consists of four permanent beers, all produced 100% by hand and named for years significant to Buffalo's history (easily their most popular offering is ""1842"", a toasty Vienna lager made with imported hops whose name commemorates the invention of the grain elevator by Buffalo milling magnate Joseph Dart), along with a slate of seasonal brews named similarly. The hours they keep are brief, but if you're in town on a Friday or Saturday, they'll fill your growler for the unbelievable price of $15."
"Located on 12 vacant lots in Cold Spring that were sold at a municipal foreclosure auction in 2011, Michigan Riley is a bit different than most area urban farms. Rather than being owned and operated by one person or family, this place is run cooperatively: individual participants sign up each year for one of two levels of membership, with ""farmers"" ($150/year) entitled to a share of both the produce from the farm itself and profits from sales in exchange for a commitment of four hours of farm work per week throughout the season, and ""gardeners"" ($25/year), who are not held to any hard-and-fast commitments but can take a proportional share of the produce based on how much work they put in. For short-term visitors and those who aren't interested in volunteering, the best way to get your hands on some of Buffalo's freshest locally-grown seasonal vegetables and herbs is at the seasonally-open farm stand on Riley Street — as well as a few blocks away at '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street, on the second Saturday of each month."
"Buffalo's culinary history is a cautionary tale, littered with stories of folks who've tried and failed to reinvent the chicken wing. Kobie Lewis is different. Since 2002, this consummate wing lover has been on a quest to craft the perfect iteration of Buffalo's signature foodstuff, and along the way he's learned the important lesson of working within the limitations of his source material rather than trying to force chicken wings to fill roles they weren't designed for. The result is what he calls ""specialty wings"", or ""swings"" for short — and Lewis has five '''National Wing Fest''' trophies to attest to his success. Every evening at this part-food shop, part-takeout restaurant, you can choose from over 18 original flavors, comprising the standard Buffalo sauce with varying levels of heat, barbecue wings from classic to hickory-smoked and honey BBQ, and oddballs like taco-seasoned and lemon-pepper wings. Swings sells their house-recipe wing sauce and barbecue sauce in bottles as well, in-store or via mail order."
"From his start in 1985 making custom promotional chocolate bars embossed with corporate logos (hence the name), ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson has guided Choco-Logo to its present-day status as perhaps the most highly-regarded chocolate manufacturer in Western New York (the accolades even extend to the pages of the ''New York Times'', who lauded them as the official chocolate provider for '''Bloomingdale's''' department stores). Located on Broadway just outside downtown and right next door to the historic '''Colored Musicians' Club''', Choco-Logo's small factory store has been open since 2005 to sate Buffalonians' sweet tooth with artisanal chocolates manufactured just a short walk away. Most of the time the selection here is fairly modest, comprising dark and milk chocolate truffles, chocolate-covered nuts, Choco-Logo's famous ""Nutcorn"" (caramel corn stuffed with roasted nuts and coated in chocolate), and a variety of sea-salted caramels that were sampled by President Obama during his visit to Buffalo in 2010. But the holidays is when you really want to come — his seasonal selections are where Johnson's creativity really comes out to shine, with unique truffle options such as Eggnog, Black & Tan, and Ice Wine. Small-group tours of the attached chocolate factory are also available on request."
"During winter, Newell Nussbaumer's upscale flea market — which spends the milder months at '''Parish Commons''' in the Elmwood Village — moves indoors to '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street. As always, the Peddler features a dizzying variety of antique knickknacks and upscale vintage clothes sold by a growing roster of vendors."
"Operated since 1995 by the '''Greater Refuge Temple of Christ''''s Reverend Gordon Sweat and his wife Larcenia, Alive Christian Bookstore carries copies of the Bible in a variety of different translations, as well as Bible study materials, Sunday School readers from the Union Gospel Press, and sundry other Christian literature. The purview of this place doesn't end with books, though; Alive is also a source for church supplies including robes, clergy shirts and other specialty clothing."
"The Bible Society of Western New York has been active since 1847, a nondenominational and nonsectarian ministry that distributes to the local citizenry free copies of the Good Book written in a language that is plainspoken and accessible to the masses. That mission continues on today, but they also run a ""Bible Book Store"" on Main Street in Fillmore-Leroy that stocks a huge selection of different Bibles representing every edition you can think of as well as 40 foreign languages. Youth ministry guides, Bible study materials, and a small selection of other Christian and secular literature are also to be had, and the Bible Society has also teamed up with their next-door neighbor, '''Bender's Christian Store''', to offer church supplies such as Communion wafers, offering envelopes, and hundreds of different Christian homeschooling goods too. The ambience here is strictly no-frills — the better to keep their charitable, not-for-profit ''raison d'être'' going — but the staff is knowledgeable with any questions you may have, and the prices are unbeatable."
"Headquartered appropriately enough in an old industrial building on the north edge of Cold Spring, Buffalo ReUse's game is ""upcycling"" authentic discarded architectural elements, plumbing fixtures, furniture, and other interior pieces from homes that are slated for demolition or undergoing renovation — thereby keeping trash out of landfills while reducing demand for new items and the raw materials necessary to produce them. At the weekend ""sidewalk sales"" they hold in front of the building's Dupont Street entrance, you can buy these one-of-a-kind items — stuff you won't find in a million years at '''Home Depot''' or '''Lowe's''' — at a small fraction of what you'd pay for comparable reproduction pieces. Even if you're not looking to redo your home, the folks at ReUse are full of ideas for repurposing these old antiques into furniture, picture frames, decorative items, and more."
"If you're a fan of modern R&B and hip-hop music or the sweet strains of classic soul and Motown, you'll want to make a stop at this institution that's been anchoring the north end of the Cold Spring business district since 1962. At Doris Records you'll get friendly service with no pretense or condescension, but to describe the place as ""old-school"" would be true in some ways and not in others. For instance, it's getting more and more rare to come across this type of small, friendly mom-and-pop record shop anymore — but the hipster-driven resurgence of vinyl LPs has yet to find its way here, with CDs and DVDs dominating the inventory and only a modest selection of record albums. You can also browse a modest variety of baseball caps, T-shirts, and other streetwear, as well as racks of urban-oriented lifestyle magazines such as ''XXL''."
"The original Bikeshop has been at the service of East Aurora bicycle enthusiasts since 2006, and it's only fitting that the shop's first introduction to the rapidly growing community of urban cyclists in Buffalo has come via a storefront in '''The Hub''', the complex of bicycle culture-themed shops and loft apartments opened in 2014 in the old '''Sibley & Holmwood Candy Company''', of which Bikeshop is one of the original tenants. At Bikeshop Buffalo you can expect the same expert service and friendly mom-and-pop atmosphere as at the original, but here the product lines trend sharply toward high-performance road bikes for urban use, to the almost complete exclusion of off-road and mountain bikes. Bianchi, Redline, and Scott are some of the popular brands carried here, and available exclusively at the Buffalo location is the '''Retül''' line of professional performance-enhancing bike fittings. Also on offer are a full range of parts and accessories, helmets, jerseys, shoes, and even bike-mountable GPS units. Prices are high, but so is the quality of what this place carries, so if you're a serious cyclist Bikeshop Buffalo merits a look."
"This brightly-decorated storefront in Delavan-Bailey is a destination for those in search of urban-oriented sportswear, outerwear, jeans and sneakers from popular brands like Nike, Timberland, and New Era. Gear Up is a crowded and not particularly well-organized place, but there are some nice finds if you're willing to hunt them down a little bit. That's especially true of the sneaker selection: if you're looking for something that really stands out, with bright colors and unusual designs, stop by. New arrivals come in every week, and Gear Up also boasts a modest range of ladies' fashions, handbags and other accessories."
"Owned since 2006 by James Barclay and situated on Genesee Street an easy walk from '''Schiller Park''', Get Your'z is a source for trendy, statement-making designer ladies' apparel (and some menswear too). Dresses, blouses, stylish jeans, leggings and hosiery come in bold colors and daring styles, and sales and promotions happen frequently. Interestingly, Get Your'z also stocks a range of car accessories."
"Owner Lakeisha Williams proudly sells her line of new and secondhand women's ""Fashions on a Budget"" in this sparsely decorated storefront in the heart of the Delavan-Bailey business district. If your tastes tend toward the Afrocentric, KeeKee's is the place for you, with lots of colorful wooden jewelry and flowing dresses in tribal-style prints, but aside from that the styles here tend to be a bit more understated than what you'll find on a your typical East Side urban fashion boutique. But there are some really upscale finds here among the dresses, blouses, shawls, shoes, handbags, and other accessories."
"A newer addition to the roster of Bailey Avenue clothing boutiques, Legacy Apparel is a huge emporium located at the far southern end of the strip stocked with a huge range of streetwear for both men and women — hoodies, jackets, baseball caps, and some of the best-priced jeans you'll find anywhere on the East Side. Bright colors and hip-hop styles abound. And if Bailey Avenue is particularly busy on the day you visit, never fear about parking — Legacy Apparel boasts an ample off-street lot."
"The East Side satellite location of the original '''Mr. Millennium''' in Grant-Amherst, Mr. Millennium II is located in Delavan-Bailey and mostly stocks the merchandise that has made the original so successful: a mixture of prepaid mobile phones and accessories on the one hand, and on the other hand a staggering range of clothing for men and women that runs the gamut from T-shirts and hoodies to designer jeans to ladies' formalwear to jewelry and accessories galore."
"Sky's the Limit is run by local entrepreneur Ahmed Ahmed, a second-generation Yemeni-American immigrant who also owns '''Farm Fresh Market''' across the street. The main attraction here is a dizzying range of beauty supplies as well as wigs and weaves, but there's also a similarly impressive selection of urban-style women's apparel and footwear, with excellent bargains to be had on bold, sassy tops, leggings, dresses and other formalwear, work uniforms, and even kids' clothing. The downside at Sky's the Limit is the customer service, which tends toward the inattentive."
"As the name indicates, Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar is a small grocery store in Schiller Park that serves the needs of the area's teeming South Asian immigrant community with a small selection of ethnic foods. Here you'll find a variety of spices, staple foods such as rice and dried grains, as well as more standard bodega fare such as soda pop, snack foods, and canned goods. Friendly customer service is a specialty at Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar: the credo is ""Quality comes first, profit is its logical sequence""."
"Steve's Meats has been serving the Delavan-Bailey community and beyond since 1978, and you don't get that kind of longevity in a business without something special in the mix — and the one factor that makes this place stand out from the rest of Buffalo's purveyors of fresh meat is the topnotch customer service. Again and again, customers rave about the consistent friendliness of owner Mark Lesinski and his staff and how they truly go above and beyond in assisting their customers, whether it be in-store helping them navigate the counters and freezers or making home deliveries to regular customers who can't make it out for whatever reason. As well, Steve's stocks some of the freshest meats around: stuffed pork chops, steak rollups, chuck roasts, chicken breasts, and even custom-made combo packs fly off the shelves, and in the freezers you'll find a selection of chicken fingers, pizza logs, and other snacks, Jamaican-style beef patties, and breakfast treats like waffles, French toast and hash browns. If you're visiting near the beginning of the month, you'll likely have to brave crowds, but customers nearly always leave happy."
"""More"" is no exaggeration here — the merchandise offered by Georgetta Lowe at her brand-new Schiller Park shop can only be described as wide-ranging. Dennise's sells everything but the kitchen sink — kids' and adult clothes; shoes, handbags and accessories; housewares and decorative knickkacks; toys, quirky gifts, and even some furniture — with service that's friendly and outgoing. It can sometimes be a challenge navigating the crowded and jumbled interior of this place, but the prices are decent (and sometimes better than decent — sales and promotions are frequent, and special events take place periodically)."
"This Delavan-Bailey destination stocks everything for the tobacco enthusiast on your list: M&J's has hookah pipes, loose tobacco, rolling papers, and other accessories for sale at rock-bottom prices (cash only, though)."
"These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space boast dozens of stalls and eateries selling all manner of groceries, prepared foods, housewares, decorative baubles, and unique gifts all under one roof. Though its current building was erected in 1956, the Market dates to 1888, the very beginning of the area's rise as home of the city's Polish community; it was not only a place for neighborhood residents to stock up on daily essentials, but also a gathering place for Buffalo Poles to meet up with their friends, see and be seen, and enjoy a comforting reminder of their homeland. Today, Polish and other Eastern European foods and gifts still predominate, but the Market's offerings are slowly diversifying to better reflect the vibrant pastiche of the modern-day East Side, with soul food stands, halal groceries, and other eclectic goods on offer. The Market is most popular in the weeks leading up to Easter, when Buffalonians crowd through the doors in search of savory ''kielbasa'' and Polish hams, traditional pastries like ''chruściki'' and ''placek'', and the '''butter lambs''' that are a tradition peculiar to Buffalo. But it's worthwhile to visit during other times of the year too, when it's quiet enough to get a real feel for the place — outside the Easter season, Saturday is the best day to go, as many if not most of the stalls close on weekdays."
"At the Broadway Market on Saturday mornings and afternoons and pretty much anywhere else in the city at other times, Dexter Shaw sells quality men's hats — fedoras, porkpies, newsboy caps, and more — to neighborhood types looking for a snazzy addition to their style. Satisfaction is 100% guaranteed."
"Perhaps be a more accurate name for this place would be ""Everything's Very African-American"" — while they stock a token selection of tribal-themed decorative items as well as shea butter shampoo and body lotion, you won't find any dashiki, kaftans, or other such items here. Instead, this Broadway Market fashion boutique features a range of smart urban styles that walk the line between upscale elegance and street-level sass, with fancy dresses and ladies' hats as well as some really nice gold jewelry."
"With Gridlock Lacquer, Lisa Menchetti offers a full line of specialty hand-mixed nail polishes in colors and designs that pay tribute to the mighty industrial history and rich culture of Buffalo — only here can you adorn your nails with the vibrant colors of ""Loganberry"", ""The Blizzard of '77"", and the Polish-themed ""Smingus Dyngus"". All products are cruelty-free and made with ingredients sourced from U.S.-based suppliers, and they contain no toxic formaldehyde. And if you're visiting from another Rust Belt city, they have Rochester-, Pittsburgh-, and Cleveland-themed collections as well."
"The Custom Hatter is an institution that's been quietly prospering among the decline of the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood for over three decades: it's where owner Gary Witkowski practices the fast-disappearing craft of old-style hatmaking. A lifelong East Sider, Witkowski came up in the retail industry as a salesman and buyer in the hat department of upscale downtown clothier '''Peller & Mure''' — that's where he first came to an appreciation for fine men's hats, which he later honed as an apprentice to master milliner Henry Goldstein of Lynn, Massachusetts before striking out on his own in 1980. Today, in addition to the countless neighborhood residents he has helped to cap off (as it were) a formal ensemble in just the right way, Witkowski can boast of having outfitted big-budget Broadway shows like ''Guys & Dolls'' and ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', of his hats being worn on the big screen by stars like James Garner and Leonardo DiCaprio, and of his store being lauded in the pages of the ''New York Times'' and ''Fortune'' magazine. Orders are called in from around the country for fedoras, porkpies, homburgs, and other hats — all crafted on antique millinery tools — but if you're in the market for one yourself, this pleasant, well-lit store is stocked floor-to-ceiling with selections. Prices rank decisively in the high-end, but what you're paying for is quality that's second-to-none: Witkowski's workmanship hearkens back to the old school, using real beaver, chinchilla and muskrat fur with linings and leather sweatbands carefully sewn in place, rather than glued."
"Tucked away in plain sight in a low-hung, unassuming building next to '''St. John Kanty Catholic Church''', Shoe Heaven is a one-stop shop for sassy ladies' footwear in bright colors and daring designs. Dominating the inventory inside this bright, airy, well-kept shop are platform heels and wedges, but you can find lots of pumps, sandals, flats, and other styles too. Shoe Heaven's staff engages their customers with service that is always warm and gracious, and the merchandise is suitable for all budgets: nothing is priced higher than $60!"
"Martha Pickett's consignment shop in the heart of the Broadway-Fillmore business district caters to plus-size ladies with a bevy of brightly-colored, vibrantly-patterned, and sassily stylish clothes, jewelry, outerwear (they specialize in North Face coats and fleeces), and accessories such as handbags and shoes."
"On the ground floor of the '''Mitchell Square Building''' at the corner of Broadway and Fillmore is where Mohammed Abubakar sells a wide variety of clothing and accessories for men and women, in a mix of styles that runs the gamut from elegant upscale fashions to urban street gear. This & That is also a place to pick up prepaid phones and accessories."
"The name of this place is no joke: established in 2005, Sadi Mohamed's Broadway fashion outlet is on the cutting edge of the latest urban fashions, with name brands like Akoo, Nike, Rocawear, Polo, and even Prada on the shelves. At Trendz, you'll find tight acid-washed jeans, graphic tees, hoodies, jackets and more."
"Located in the former '''Payless ShoeSource''' right on the corner of Broadway and Fillmore, the two main claims to fame at Vibes are designer jeans and sneakers, the latter of which in an especially interesting selection comprising all the latest brands and lots of Day-Glo colors. As well, you'll find an eclectic mix of other apparel, accessories and beauty supplies for the urban set."
"Serving a growing immigrant community on the East Side from a stall in the traditionally-Polish Broadway Market, Al Baraka's kitchen-sink list of merchandise consists of flours and grains, a huge selection of teas, dried fruits and legumes, fruit juices and other cold drinks, a small selection of halal meats, and more and more. Products from India and the Middle East are the main attraction, but there are also East Asian groceries to choose from as well. Staff is friendly as can be."
"Situated along the back wall of the Market with one large cooler for seafood and one for meat, Broadway Seafood & Meat is ''huge''. The latter cooler has pretty much every kind of butcher meat you can think of, including unusual items like rabbit and soul-food staples like hamhocks, pigs' feet, turkey necks and chitlins; the former proudly displays fresh whole fish on ice (again, pretty much every kind you can think of; the selection of freshwater whitefish is especially good), as well as huge five-pound fish fillets, crab legs that come fresh or packaged, and homemade hush puppies for a side dish. Service is prompt and friendly, and prices have to be seen to be believed."
"Aside from the stand-alone location in Humboldt Park they expanded to in 2013, Camellia Meats' Broadway Market stall is still alive and kicking, with a full range of the same high-quality, low-price fresh meats you can get at the other place. Yes, that includes the award-winning house-brand '''Cichocki's''' Polish sausage."
"Drawing on her background in the catering business as well as her talents in the kitchen, Debra Dechert took up canning as a hobby in 1989. Little did she know that a quarter-century later it would turn into a lucrative business for her: Deb's Delights ships its inventory nationwide from their headquarters in East Aurora, and their products sit on the shelves at numerous supermarkets in the Western New York Area in addition to its flagship retail outlet that opens for business each Wednesday at the Broadway Market. What products make up that inventory? No less than 70 different varieties of jellies, relishes, salsas, hot sauces, condiments, and — above all — pretty much any kind of vegetable that can be pickled; a high-quality range of stuff that ably demonstrates the truth of her slogan, ""If you can't, I can""."
"Sure, at this longtime Broadway Market vendor you can pick up a jar of the delicious, zesty namesake product which can otherwise be found in supermarkets all over the area, as well as harder-to-find beet horseradish. But Famous Horseradish also stocks a full range of horseradish-infused products like spicy mustard and cocktail sauce, as well as a variety of homemade pickles and sauerkraut. The remaining space on the shelves is filled out by a selection of fresh produce that's similar to the kind of stuff you'll find at '''Lewandowski's''', but reduced in variety and quantity — though naturally, if you're in the market for fresh horseradish root you're in luck."
"Keeping Traditions is the project of brother-and-sister team Greg and Julie Czochara, who keep alive their late mother's traditional pierogi recipe (hence the name) that their family enjoyed every Christmas: they handmake hundreds of these dumplings a day in their facility in Tonawanda, fresh-freeze them, and ship them to a growing roster of local stores and supermarkets as well as selling them directly to the public at the Broadway Market, on Saturdays from mid-November through Easter (unlike the majority of the vendors at the Market, Christmastime is Keeping Traditions' high season; they're here daily around the holidays). The pierogi these folks make are pretty hefty — around 5 inches (13cm) in size on average — and come with a variety of fillings including farmer cheese, cheddar cheese, onion, potato, sauerkraut, mushroom, and various combinations of the above, as well as special varieties that change from month to month."
"Kissed by the Sun Spice Company was born in 1999, when owner Liz Fickhesen fell in love with the bold, zesty flavors of the Caribbean while on vacation in Tortola. True to form, these all-natural, all-kosher, pesticide- and MSG-free spice blends are the perfect accompaniment to island cuisine (their website even has an online cookbook for some ideas). Kissed by the Sun's biggest sellers are their seasoned sea salt blend with garlic, celery seed, parsley and a hint of ginger — a healthy alternative to table salt with one-third the sodium — as well as the sweet-hot pepper flakes made from the skins of red and jalapeño peppers, flavorful yet not too spicy."
"Open six days a week, this longtime Broadway Market vendor is the place to come if you want fresh fruits and vegetables. Most of what you'll find at Lewandowski's is fairly standard produce-section stuff — onions, potatoes, lettuce, broccoli, peppers, and other stuff that will do you well if you plan to whip up a delicious Polish meal, as well as apples, oranges, bananas — but there are some more interesting finds as well, especially when it comes to root vegetables (rutabaga and yams are ubiquitous) and a surprising selection of unroasted nuts and fresh herbs. Lewandowski's also stocks a small variety of honey, jams, and preserves."
"When it comes to Broadway Market butcher shops, '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' may have size and variety on their side, but these guys have the crowds. The venerable stand operated by family patriarch Petru Lupas and his son, David, is an old-school operation — ""as close as you can get to the original Broadway Market"", in the words of one reviewer who grew up in Polonia during its golden years — and the constant hustle and bustle of customers testifies to the quality of what they sell. Lupas sells meats that are handcut daily, and the stars of the show are (of course) Polish delicacies such as fresh and smoked kielbasa, ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and slab bacon. This is also a place to find workmanlike cuts like oxtails, neckbones, hog jowls, chicken feet and other stuff that you can't get at fancy-shmancy places elsewhere, as well as soul-food cuts that cater to an incresingly African-American customer base. In terms of deli meats, bologna, ham, and other pork products abound, as do local brands: '''Wardynski's''' and '''Sahlen's''' wieners, '''Russer''' ham and bologna, '''Yancey's Fancy''' deli cheeses, and Lupas' own house brand. To cut down on the already low prices, you might opt for one of the variety packs if you're buying a large quantity, or else show up late in the day, when prices are reduced to move as much inventory as possible."
"In Buffalo, Malczewski's is synonymous with the local tradition of the ''baranek wielkanocny'', or butter lamb — the centerpiece of the traditional Easter breakfast spread, it's a block of butter sculpted by hand into the shape of a lamb (symbolic of the ""Lamb of God"" of Catholic iconography), with a red ribbon tied around its neck (a symbol of the blood of Christ) and a red-and-white Alleluia flag stuck in its back. The butter lamb is a tradition native to several Eastern European lands, but on this side of the Atlantic it's unique to Buffalo. Since Mr. and Mrs. Malczewski retired in 2013, '''Camellia Meats''' has taken over the making of the butter lambs, as well as the rest of the operations at this old-school Broadway Market food stall: all your favorite Polish specialties are represented, from homemade pierogi and ''kluski'' noodles to ''kiszka'', ''kapusta'', ''czernina'', farmers' cheese, and smoked hams."
"In her hometown of North Tonawanda, Paula Duge grew up with the tradition of helping her mother make traditional Polish pierogi for their Easter morning breakfast. Today, the savory dumplings she whips up at her facility in suburban Rochester are still made by hand using authentic ingredients and the secret Kurasiewicz family recipe — ""just like Babci made"", as the saying goes. Whether it be traditional savory fillings like potato, sauerkraut, or imported farmers' cheese or dessert pierogi stuffed with fruit preserves, they're all preservative-free and delicious. Paula's sister Judy handles the Buffalo-area operations of Pierogi by Paula, including its presence at the Broadway Market every Saturday. (If you're here on Tuesday or Friday, the folks at '''White Eagle Bakery''' have a key and can get you pierogi from the freezer case.)"
"Spices by Milly offers up a selection of spices and herbs that dwarfs what you can find on the shelves of your average supermarket, and whose chef-level quality comes from the hours of research the owner puts in on the ideal physical characteristics and preparation and storage methods for each of her individual products. That's just the beginning of the story, though: Milly also stocks a huge range of prepared goodies like cooking oils, salad dressings and dips, hot sauces and salsas, dehydrated vegetables, a range of premium quality herbal teas (including decaffeinated varieties), and powdered soup and gravy mixes based on her own family recipes."
"In business on Sycamore Street since 2009, the Bengali-language sign that adorns the front of the building testifies to the origin of owner Muhammad Munshi, to the identity of the immigrant community it serves, and to the type of goods that you can find inside. Namely, the merchandise at A.D. consists of halal groceries from all over the Indian Subcontinent and the Middle East, with an emphasis on meats including chicken, beef, lamb, goat and more. As well, you can pick up a range of fresh produce and Asian spices."
"Now in a new location on Sycamore Street, Al-Amin is a small ethnic grocery with a full slate of certified-halal meats and fish, as well as housewares, Islamic clothing, and bodega-style merchandise like candy and cold soft drinks. They even do home deliveries."
"Halal meats such as chicken, beef and fish are proudly touted on the sign in front of this little Bengali-owned store, as well as fresh produce that's locally sourced in many cases. But the true essence of Al-Madina is that it's very much a regular grocery store, only scaled down in size, with all products certified halal and a small variety of ethnic goods too. As well, you can find housewares and toiletries here including pots and pans, dish soap, baby powder, shampoo, and the like."
"This Middle Eastern and South Asian food shop opened in late 2014 at the far east end of the new shopping plaza at the corner of Broadway and Sweet Avenue. At Foodland you'll find a mix of specialty groceries including halal meat and fish, fresh produce, spices and frozen foods. As well, they always have a pot of hot coffee on."
"Opened in 2013 in the former home of '''Dick Haberl's Tire Center''' in Schiller Park and moved three years later to its current location in the heart of the East Side's immigrant community, this place's name is something of a misnomer: the inventory at Kamuna International Groceries consists mostly of standard bodega fare like cold drinks and packaged snacks. But there is a small selection of halal meats and other Arabian and African food items, as well as ethnic clothing, shea butter and other toiletries."
"Wilson Street Urban Farm comprises 25 lots on the west side of Wilson Street between Broadway and Sycamore: about two acres (a little less than a hectare) of land tilled by the Stevens family, who, as transplants to Buffalo from the rural areas outside the city, use their agricultural know-how to serve as mentors and role models to a growing movement of like-minded homesteaders. The farm grows a wide range of produce such as turnips, arugula, cucumbers, peas, carrots, kohlrabi, onions, garlic, beans, leafy greens and herbs, both outdoors in the ground as well as inside their custom-built hothouse. While about half of the harvest goes to feed the nine-member Stevens family themselves, they offer the rest up for sale on Saturday mornings at their farm stand, which is one of the best places in the neighborhood to get fresh seasonal veggies — indeed, the mission statement of the farm is to ""make fresh, local, naturally-grown produce readily available to Buffalo's East Side""."
"At the Broadway Market, countless Polish confectioners have come and gone over the years, but the Chruściki Bakery is the stalwart original that (despite a marked decline in service and quality over the years) still keeps folks lining up all year long, but especially in the weeks leading up to Easter, to satisfy their sweet tooth. The titular item that earned this place their stature is ''chruściki'', otherwise known as ""angel wings"" — flat strips of dough twisted into ribbon shapes, deep-fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar; a light-as-air deliciousness — but you can also pick up ''pączki'', ''placek'', ''makowiec'', and ''mazurek'', as well as home-baked rye bread, pierogi, and full hot breakfasts. The Chruściki Bakery also has locations in Kenmore and Lancaster."
"Kettle corn is the specialty that gave this longtime Broadway Market stall its name: it comes in three sizes and in regular, cinnamon, and extra-sweet flavors. But there's also fresh honey, beeswax, and handmade candies sourced directly from Lyle Franklin's expansive Chautauqua County farmstead, as well as novelty beer glasses, knit hand towels, and other miscellaneous stuff."
"Scratch-made cakes, pastries and cookies come out of the oven all day at Melanie Krygier's sweet shop, which has been open here at 999 Broadway since 1978. Melanie's specialty is ""lamb cakes"": lamb-shaped slabs of pound cake drizzled in a sweet sugar glaze and frosted with a white coconut icing."
"""We'll dip anything in chocolate"" is the saying around here, and at Strawberry Island that can mean anything from marshmallow Peeps, to roasted nuts, to Twinkies, to the fresh strawberries that gave this place its name. But that's just the beginning of the story: this old-time candy shop stocks all the sweets you remember from the halcyon days of your youth — jelly beans, saltwater taffy, crispy sugar waffles, fudge — as well as only-in-Buffalo specialties like sponge candy (available in regular, dark chocolate or orange chocolate) and Charlie Chaplins (a mix of marshmallows, roasted cashews, and coconut flakes covered in chocolate fudge and sprinkled with coarse salt)."
"Barbara Keating started out whipping up small batches of family-recipe Polish pastries like ''makowiec'' and selling them at craft shows and farmers' markets around the area, but today Sweet Temptations du Jour has expanded to an eclectic array of sweets representing culinary traditions from across Europe — German ''pfefferneusse'' spice cookies, Russian teacakes, Italian ''cugidati'', and Croatian-style apple strudel are just a few of the concoctions available by special order from the website. As for the Broadway Market stand where you can find Keating every Saturday, it stocks a limited slate of changing selections from Sweet Temptations' oeuvre, always including the specialty of the house: light, crunchy sugar waffles dipped in chocolate and topped with candied nuts, dubbed ""Sweet Nuthings"". Chocolate-covered kettle corn is another big seller. And if you're planning a trip to Buffalo but can't make it to the Broadway Market on a Saturday, fear not — Sweet Temptations du Jour also has a brick-and-mortar location in Allentown!"
"Owned since 1925 by four generations of the same family, White Eagle Bakery is most famous for their ''chruściki'', the familiar red-and-white boxes of which adorn the shelves at '''Wegmans''' and other area supermarkets in the runup to Easter. But these folks sell the whole lineup of Polish pastries: ''placek'', strudel, cream horns, pastry hearts, cakes and pies, and the seasonal favorite ''pączki'' which flies off the shelves from Fat Tuesday all the way through to Easter Sunday. As well, a close second to ''chruściki'' on the list of customers' favorite White Eagle products is the wholesome, soft-crust seeded Polish rye bread baked fresh daily. If you're in town at the beginning of the week, come see these folks at their other location, '''D&L Bakery''' in Depew."
"Since 1995, the name of the game here has been an overwhelming selection of furniture for ever room of the house, in a no-frills warehouse settling just waiting to be be browsed through. If the sheer amount of dinette sets, bunk beds, recliners, lamps, mattresses, desks, entertainment centers, bedroom sets, bookcases, ''ad nauseam'' is too much for you to wrap your head around, National Warehouse Furniture's helpful and knowledgeable staff are always on hand to help you find the piece that's right for you, and even to give advice on how to arrange it withing your home."
"""Louie the Furniture Man"" is the guy you want to see at Prestige, which has been going strong in St. John Kanty since 1970. This place has been family-owned and operated since 1970, and its loyal legions of customers are members of that family too: honest service at some of the best prices in Buffalo is something the folks at Prestige take real pride in (they'll even customize pieces to your specification!) As for the merchandise, it comprises sofas, chairs, bedding, dinette sets, sectionals, lamps, and decorative items, ranges from classic conservative styles to statement-making pieces in bold colors and prints, and invludes brands such as Hughes, Liberty, and Coaster."
"The warm-colored, yellowish little gems that gave this place its name are sourced directly from Poland's Baltic Sea shoreline, and adorn a huge range of jewelry including earrings, rings, necklaces and pendants, bracelets, brooches and more. But that's just the beginning of the story here: you can also choose from a range of Polish porcelainware, all handpainted the old-fashioned way with lead-free glaze and safe for use in the freezer, dishwasher, oven, or microwave. And if you're in the market for a kitschy gift, you can find coffee mugs, shot glasses, sweatshirts, decals, decorative items all emblazoned with the proud Polish flag."
"This is where West Seneca native Audrey Lehr sells a wide variety of brightly colored ceramic figurines, garden gnomes, kitchenware, and seasonal decorative baubles, all handmade by the artist herself. A small selection of jewelry rounds out the offerings at Ceramics By Design."
"If you're looking for the perfect kitschy souvenir to remember your visit to the Broadway Market by, Monika Poslinski's gift emporium is the place you want to be: pretty much everything on the shelves — flags, scarves, aprons, t-shirts, hats, baby clothes, shot glasses, ''ad nauseam'' — is colored red and white and comes emblazoned with the proud Polish falcon. Enchanted Market also sells charming blue and white pottery imported directly from Bolesławiec, Poland's ceramics capital, as well as imported glassware such as beer steins and wine glasses, and a selection of English- and Polish-language greeting cards."
"The name of this shop is a bit of a misnomer: the main stock in trade at Theresa's Treasures for the Home is a collection of jewelry that runs toward the loud and gaudy (sometimes hilariously so) — large, brightly-colored, and obviously fake gemstones that wouldn't look out of place at a Mardi Gras parade. Kitsch abounds in the housewares selection too: there are lots of porcelain decorative figurines and kitchenware, cut glass dishes & goblets, and trinkets such as solar powered dancing animals. If you're among the Eastertime crowds at the Broadway Market, you'll also find painted wooden Easter eggs and other seasonal fare."
"At Hands & Paws you can find a variety of artisanal pet treats made of natural, wholesome, high-quality ingredients — a popular seller are bone-shaped peanut butter cookies drizzled in yogurt and dog-safe chocolate substitute — as well as chew toys, collars, mats, and other accessories all handmade in the USA. Custom embroidery is available. Most of the items here are for dogs, but Hands & Paws also carries a line of catnip toys and cat beds."
"Sponsored by the local Franciscan Friary in Larkinville and staffed with a dedicated team of volunteers, St. Francis Thrift Store carries a range of gently used clothing at affordable prices, with an especially good selection of children's clothing to choose from. You can also find a hodgepodge of other thrift store fare around the shop, from toys and games to books to memorabilia. Donations are gratefully accepted."
"This combination Lebanese food market and lunch counter is housed in a nondescript, low-slung brick building in an industrial section of Lovejoy, so it's easy to miss. Don't, though — the tasty Mediterranean specialties manufactured, sold and served at Cedars bakery have earned every single one of the many raves that Buffalo foodies have tossed their way since the place opened in 1981. Originally located on Niagara Street in the West Side, co-owners James and Andrew Issa, a pair of brothers that represent the second generation in this family-owned enterprise, moved to Dingens Street in 2001 and also run a branch location in Orchard Park. These folks are known for their pita bread — baked onsite daily and among the freshest in the city — but Cedars is a place where you can get pretty much any ingredient you need to whip up your own tasty Mediterranean meal: imported olive oil, ''dolmades'' (grape leaves), ''labneh'' (strained yogurt), hummus, tahini, and a freezer section fully stocked with goodies like falafel mix, prepared ''spanakopita'' pies, and more. The lunch counter serves freshly prepared pita sandwiches, wraps, and savory meat pies."
"With proud red and white flags decorating the front window and ads for '''Żywiec''' beer posted all over the walls, it's not hard to guess what's stocked at this small, charming Kaisertown shop: all things Polish and edible. The European Deli's owner, Teresa Ignatowska, is a Warsaw native who met her husband when he was an American tourist, and she started the shop as a way of keeping in contact with her Polish roots after moving to Buffalo in 1971. This place keeps odd hours, only open during the end of the week, but if you're around at the right time you can take advantage of the huge selection of meats that's the European Deli's biggest draw. Front and center is the ''kielbasa'', which comes fresh, smoked, double-smoked, and in a few flavored varieties such as garlic. You can also find ''kabanosy'', ''kiszka'', ''saucison'', Krakus ham, and other delicacies. Polish pastry and baked goods are also popular — including ''makowiec'' (poppyseed cake), ''pączki'' (doughnut-like pastries stuffed with fruit preserves, especially popular around Fat Tuesday), and hearty rye bread — and you'll also find farmer cheese, herbal tea, and Polish-language books, greeting cards, and videos. Everything sold here is imported directly from Poland, and much of it can't be found anywhere else in Buffalo."
"True to its name, Federal Bakers stocks a variety of provisions for amateur bakers and expert pastry chefs alike. From basics like flour, sugar and buttercream, to hard-to-find specialty items like gum paste and pearl dust, to a variety of utensils and kitchenwares oriented to bakers, the warehouse-style setup at this out-of-the-way outlet on William Street is ample enough to house a huge selection of goods, and the excellent helpful service you get from its friendly employees will help you find what you're looking for and answer any questions you may have. Federal Bakers also carries a selection of ready-to-eat prepared desserts in its modest-sized freezer section."
"Slavic Bazaar is ''the'' place for Eastern European groceries in Buffalo, but don't be fooled by the painting on the side of the building of a pig in a frying pan: while fresh meats are indeed sold here, the selection is more modest than, say, '''European Deli''' on Clinton Street. Where Slavic Bazaar excels is in canned and packaged groceries, as well as frozen foods. Unlike the aforementioned European Deli, the selection here goes far beyond Poland: foods from Kashuba's native Ukraine as well as Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Latvia, and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe are well-represented on the shelves. Canned vegetables, snacks, chocolate, pickled products, jarred fruit preserves, and spice mixes abound, along with an ample wall of freezers stocked with pierogi homemade in the factory behind the store, frozen ''borscht'' and other soups, savory ''pelmeni'', and more. As for that modest selection of meats, there's a deli counter where you can get ''salo'', ''kiszka'', ''kabanosy'' and other favorites, as well as a small walk-in cooler with things like smoked fish fillets and Bulgarian ''kashkaval'' cheese. And if you happen to work up an appetite shopping for your favorite Eastern European imports, Slavic Bazaar also has a lunch counter where you can sink your teeth into mouth-watering pierogi (cooked in the Ukrainian style, smaller and denser than their Polish cousins), hot, sizzling sausage, and more."
"Founded in Allentown in 2006 and moved to its current home in 2014, B West Studio is the project of local artist Peter Caruso. In addition to Caruso's own work — characterized most often by energetic yet anonymous crowd scenes, rendered in acrylic paint in a style indebted to 19th-century Impressionism and often including familiar Buffalo streetscapes as a setting — B West's gallery space in the heart of Kaisertown also displays an eclectic range of works by other artists from Buffalo and around the region, with an emphasis on student works. Many of the high-quality pieces displayed in the gallery are available for sale, generally at $400 or less. Special exhibits are held on a monthly basis."
"With a background in garment production and an accomplished career as a seamstress behind her, Elisabeth von Hahn emigrated to Buffalo from Germany in 1999 and opened this cute little shop a few years later. In the words of the website, Hahn's mission to ""for the younger generation to learn the crafts that are dying out in this modern era"", so instead of focusing exclusively on popular or trendy pursuits such as knitting and cross-stitching, Kaisertown Crafts and Gifts carries supplies for a wide range of different crafts. If you're into spinning, weaving, quilting, lacemaking, or paper crafts such as stamping or Cricut, this is the place for you — they even cater to jewelry and stained-glass artisans! Even if you're not in the market to buy anything, Kaisertown Crafts and Gifts is a busy place: craft instructor Dawn Flammger comes by on a frequent basis to host classes in knitting, cardmaking, and scrapbooking, and the store even welcomes DIY types anytime during business hours for ""open crafting"", where you can pursue your craft in-store and even borrow Kaisertown Crafts' rubber and acrylic stamps, embossing folders and Cricut cartridges for a nominal price. They do alterations, too, and as for the ""gifts"" half of the equation, a range of porcelain figurines, plush toys, knitted items, books, handbags and accessories are stocked."
"Tucked away in an easy-to-miss storefront near '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the motto at The 11th Hour is ""Where Fashion Meets Style"" — and the style in question is more urban than urban. On the pastel-pink racks at this nicely-decorate boutique you'll find a compendium of edgy, eye-popping, envelope-pushing pieces, each color brighter and each pattern louder than the next: these jeans, tops, bodysuits, shoes, and accessories are for those who want to make a real statement, and decidedly ''not'' for those who don't like to wear their clothes skintight. Personal styling services are also offered."
"Since 2009, this large Bailey Avenue clothing emporium has been a destination for urban athletic wear and street-level styles that are often preppier than other fashion boutiques on the East Side. At Signature you'll find a wide selection of shoes, as well as ''lots'' of name brands: Polo, Timberland, Champion, New Era, and Levi's are only some of them."
"From the outside, this little place in Humboldt Park looks like the perfect spot to pick up a cold pop, candy bar or salty snack — and indeed, if you're in the market for something like that, you won't be disappointed. But Al Madina is much more than just another corner bodega. The sign outside the door boasts of an international selection of groceries that encompasses ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Arabian, Nepali, African, Spanish, and American"" goods, but in reality, the accent here is decidedly on Middle Eastern and South Asian foods — principally halal meats and fish, spices, and a modest selection of fresh produce. Al Madina is also a source for clothing, both including both Western and traditional Muslim garb."
"Appletree Halal Market's main claim to fame is some of the best takeout halal food you'll find in Western New York: a range of Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes including chicken, goat and lamb curries, biryani, and even halal pizza are ladled out for you from steam trays for some jaw-droppingly low prices. But if you'd rather try your hand at making your own version of this delicious cuisine, have no fear: Appletree stocks everything you need, from fresh meats to vegetables to an amazing selection of spices, plus hummus and tahini, fresh pita bread, delicious fruit juices, frozen foods, and more. You can even find traditional Muslim clothing such as ''hijabs'' and ''abayat'' here. What really sets Appletree apart, though, is the warm and helpful service provided by owner Mohsin: a friendly, larger-than-life character who imbues the place with a boisterous spirit that's light-years from the taciturn surliness of other halal food store personnel."
"At Bailey Avenue Café and Bake Shoppe you can get a great variety of cakes, pies, cookies, brownies, and other sweet treats, as well as prepared sandwiches and wraps and even soul-food dinners such as catfish fillets and fried chicken, served and/or sold to you in a spotlessly clean environment by folks who are as courteous as can be. But that's not the real reason you should visit: instead, stop in to show support for the work of '''Saving Grace Ministries''', who operates the shop as a job training service for their staff of formerly homeless individuals."
"Camellia Meats was born in 1935, when Edmund Cichocki, a longtime butcher for '''Slawinski Meats''' at the '''Broadway Market''', struck out on his own, selling his own family-recipe Polish sausage and ham. Over eighty years later, the business is still run by the third generation of the same family — and while you can get all the same stuff today as you could back then (the merchandise still trends toward Polish specialties such as ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and the aforementioned Polish sausage which has gone on to win many awards), and the Camellia of today carries a full line of over fifty fresh-cut meats both at their Broadway Market outlet and the stand-alone shop that opened on Genesee Street in 2013. This gargantuan meat market boasts a 40-foot (12m) refrigerated display case and a row of freezers on the back wall, selling multitudinous cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and fish, deli meats and cheeses, and a small selection of fresh produce and prepared foods. If you're planning to make a large purchase, take advantage of their discounted package specials."
"Located on Fillmore Avenue in Humboldt Park, Jawani is a halal grocery store and bakery that carries a modest selection of Middle Eastern specialty foods — with an accent on halal meats such as goat, lamb, chicken and fish — alongside an otherwise bodegalike selection of candy, snacks, cold pop, cigarettes, and the like. Fresh produce is also sold."
"A family-operated urban farm operated under the auspices of the '''Farmer Pirates''' collective, Pickles & Peppers is situated on a six-acre (2.5 ha) plot near the border of Genesee-Moselle and Broadway-Fillmore that's shared with Farmer Pirates' '''central composting facility'''. Owners Alex and Dan grow a range of hot peppers and other vegetables that they sell fresh, dried, pickled and prepared into a wide range of artisanal hot sauces at a seasonally-operated farm stand on Gittere Street. You can also pick up fruits from the orchard located on the same site: several dozen heirloom apple, cherry, and pear trees as well as berry bushes do double duty as a haven for area wildlife."
"At this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', you'll find a mix of ethnic specialty groceries from the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent that prominently includes a range of hand-slaughtered halal meats of superior variety, quality, and freshness: lamb, chicken, beef, and more are available directly to customers or sold wholesale to area restaurants. If you have a specific order in mind, you can even deliver it to the store via text and they'll have it waiting for you when you arrive. As well, Walden Halal Groceries also sells fresh produce, an impressive variety of spices, and bodega fare such as snacks, candy, and cold drinks. The store closes during Friday prayers, and customer service is limited by the staff's tenuous grasp of English, but this is still a good place to go for fans of Asian and Arabian cuisine."
"The Guild @ 980 is operated out of a 100-year-old factory building on the historic Belt Line Railroad by '''ReUse Action''', a group that splintered off of '''Buffalo ReUse''' in 2011 but shares much the same ''raison d'être'': salvaging construction materials, architectural elements, and furnishings from soon-to-be-demolished homes, refurbishing them, and offering them up for sale to the next generation of home builders, thereby preserving the old-fashioned craftsmanship of the original items while simultaneously conserving raw materials and preventing waste from building up in landfills. If you're in the middle of a home construction project, The Guild offers your pick of old doors, windows, wooden beams, bathtubs, sinks, floor tile, light fixtures, and the like — and if not, you can still peruse a pretty nifty selection of antique furniture and home decor. The Guild also boasts a small third-floor gallery space described above."
"The main attraction at this crowded, jumbled Fillmore Avenue bodega is a range of prepaid cell phones and calling plans, but Ansar also carries a wide range of specialty fragrances, toiletries and household items for the Arabian and African community that has coalesced in Humboldt Park: here you can find incense, rose attar and other fragrant essential oils, oil burners, shea butter soaps, and the list goes on. The picture is completed by the optimistic go-getter personality of owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur: whether expounding on his personal philosophy of ""do for self"" or just chitchatting with his customers, his spirited presence is a delight to visitors to Ansar."
"You would never imagine that such an interesting, eclectic and high-quality range of merchandise would be available in a ramshackle brownstone storefront in Delavan-Grider, but stop in to Hobby Boyz and your expectations will surely be exceeded. Browse the shelves and you'll notice that the accent here is on supplies for hobbyists: the selection of remote-control cars and airplanes, scale-model hobby kits, and supplies for collectors holds its own with any other outlet in Western New York. If what you're aiming for is something a bit more active, Hobby Boyz is also an authorized dealer and repairer of Razor brand scooters (both electric and nonmotorized); they stock a full line of accessories and safety equipment too, as well as skateboards, dirt bikes, Minimoto bikes, ATVs, and pretty much anything else you can think of on wheels. But it gets even more diverse than that: as if to really emphasize the ""variety"" in owner Richard Wagstaff's slogan, ""a new-style variety store"", you'll find a full line of car stereos and audio equipment, designer clothes, video games, DVDs, hair-care products, convenience-store snacks, and a ridiculously ample range of other goods."
"Simply put, Leslie Thomas' small, friendly Fillmore Avenue boutique is a gold mine for folks in search of high-quality vintage items: secondhand skirts, blouses, fancy dresses, shoes and even menswear are available for a song, as well as housewares and decorative items. Donations are graciously accepted, too — as the store's credo goes, ""the value in a person is in what he gives, not what he receives""."
"On and off since 1969 — when he's had the spare time to put into running it, on top of working his primary job — Our World Boutique has been Harry Stokes' own labor of love. Its latest iteration opened in 2009, in the same building the shop was in when it last closed its doors in 1987, but the inventory on the shelves remains the same as ever: Our World was described in a ''Buffalo Rising'' writeup as being ""dedicated to a world of ethnic delights"", but really that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Instead, the ''huge'' range of items stocked here are a magnificent reflection of the vitality of Buffalo's African-American community in all its facets. ""Diaspora gifts"" of all descriptions are the name of the game here: from African-inspired artwork, housewares, and decorative knickknacks, to toiletry items like black and shea butter soaps and a range of natural body oils and creams, to scarves, kaftans and other clothing. But if Our World's inventory has one singular strong point, it's literature — Bibles, Korans, and books touching on African-American themes abound; those interested in local African-American news and views can pick up copies of the ''Challenger'', ''Criterion'', or ''Final Call''; and, above all, they stock Buffalo's largest selection of Afrocentric greeting cards, with over a dozen series represented. The vivacious personality of Our World's owner is matched by the vivacious colors on the outer walls of the building: proud, bright reds, oranges, greens and blues, inspired in equal measures by the attractive storefronts of Elmwood Avenue and other fashionable shopping districts, as well as the vibrant hues of Africa. This place is truly one of a kind."
"Auntie's has flaws, but they're worth overlooking. The place keeps odd hours and is helmed by an owner who's known to be cranky with customers from time to time, but the food is delicious and the menu is much wider-ranging than other area Jamaican restaurants. You'll certainly find what you're looking for at Auntie's if you're in the mood for one of the basic standards, like jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail, or escoveitch fish, but if you're feeling more adventurous, they also have harder-to-find selections like curry shrimp, ackee and saltfish, and red snapper. Best of all, Auntie makes her own ginger beer; if you're not in the mood for that, other drinks include sorrel, Irish moss, and healthy carrot and cucumber juices. Dessert adds a strong Southern/Creole accent to the proceedings, courtesy of options like banana bread and homemade sweet potato pudding."
"Baba's Place opened in 1989 as '''Sam's Express''' and has been serving ""ethnically influenced comfort food"" (their words, and perhaps the best possible description of the fare served there) under their current name since 2001. This is a tiny little restaurant with only a few tables, but that just makes the selection of food available there all the more impressive: a mélange of Greek and American specialties that come in portions that are huge and prices that aren't, and are served quickly and efficiently by friendly staff. Buffalo Greek diner staples such as gyro and souvlaki are served the traditional way — with pita bread and a Greek salad on the side — or you can get them on sub rolls. They're equally good either way. Baba's Place serves a range of other pita-pocket sandwiches and ""pita tacos"" as well, plus shish kebabs and a truly delicious rice pudding; vegetarians will be pleasantly surprised by the range of meat-free options here, such as falafel and ''spanakopita'' (spinach pie layered in ''phyllo'' dough). Consensus says the American food served here isn't quite as good as the Greek, but you can get a selection of hot and cold subs and melt sandwiches, as well as Asian-influenced selections such as your choice of chicken, beef or shrimp stir-fried over rice."
"Bailey Fish and Seafood is the only seafood restaurant on the East Side — and the only one it needs. There's no indoor seating here, so you'll have to take your food back to the hotel with you, often braving seemingly endless lines to do so (especially on Fridays, when their topnotch fish fry packs the house) — but it's worth it. Why? Simply put, the food here is ''really, really good'': the freshest, tastiest seafood Buffalo has to offer, with shipments of high-quality product arriving daily from all over the United States. The marquee item at Bailey Seafood is the ""Haddock Super Sandwich"", a feast that truly lives up to its superlative name: a gargantuan fried filet on a locally baked '''Costanzo's''' bun, topped with tangy coleslaw and homemade French fries, big enough for two people to share yet at a price of only $5. This and other sandwiches are frequently ordered in combos (or, for larger parties, ""family packs"") where the already excellent value for your money is improved further. Dinnertime at Bailey Seafood sees mains like breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp skewers, crawfish, steamed clams, and various fish filets served ''à la carte'' or in combo packs, and they even sell fresh fish and one-, two-, and five-pound packs of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters if you're planning an event. Meanwhile, the slate of appetizers and sides is where the Southern and Creole influences that pervade Bailey Seafood's menu come out best: try the hush puppies, mac & cheese, fried okra, or homemade sweet potato pie if you want a sample. Service is quick and friendly especially considering the unrelenting crowds the staff has to deal with; if you want to make it easier on them and yourself, you can call ahead or order online and they'll have your food waiting for you when you arrive."
"With a multitude of '''Taste of Buffalo''' awards under its belt and a strong claim on the title of best Jamaican food in town, the ""experience"" here is astoundingly good, if a bit strange at first. The odd way the restaurant is set up is usually the first impression for first-time visitors to Caribbean Experience: the front room is a handsome if usually empty bar with a pool table, and the counter where you order your food is in the back (ring the buzzer in front to get the owner's attention). In between is a large dining room, sparsely but pleasantly decorated with Jamaican flags adorning the dark wood panelling of the walls. The food served here earns no points for innovation — Caribbean Experience's menu sticks to the standards, but does so with aplomb. The jerk chicken is flavored perfectly, not overpowering in its spiciness but with a meaty, somewhat smoky aroma and none of the sweetness that occasionally pops up at places like '''Curly's''' or the recently closed '''Mangoz''', and the culinary excellence carries over to the other selections as well: curry goat, brown stew chicken, oxtail, escoveitch fish, and a few others. Authenticity is the rule, and portion sizes are huge especially considering the prices. All meals are served with fried plantains, red beans and rice (they'll cover it with delicious, spicy jerk gravy if you want — highly recommended), and steamed cabbage; all your favorite island beverages are offered as well, from ginger beer to Irish moss to rum punch."
"Opened in 2016 in a restored building on Bailey Avenue, The Fire Spit's name is apropos — not only is its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter, but he valiantly persevered with his dream of operating a family-owned restaurant even after an electrical fire ripped through the building just before the planned opening of the restaurant, setting him back two full years. But, what does The Fire Spot serve? Char-grilled hot dogs? Blazing-hot Mexican or Asian food? Wilkinson doesn't take the metaphor quite that far, but if you're in the mood for some delicious, homestyle soul food classics made fresh to order and served by one of the friendliest staffs of any restaurant in the city, this is a place you should check out. Though The Fire Spot does stay open through dinnertime, breakfast (all-day!) and lunch are the two busiest times of the day here: the biggest seller on the menu by far are the chicken and waffles, uniquely served with whole, unsplit wings fried up to crispy perfection (you can substitute tenders or traditional wings on request). At lunchtime, you can also try a delicious steak hoagie slathered in Wilkinson's own secret-recipe ""Tailgate Comeback Sauce""; if you've come with a bigger appetite, tuck into one of the combo platters on the dinner menu where fried chicken, haddock or shrimp come with your choice of Southern-style sides. The Fire Spot is a small place with only a few tables in the dining room, so come prepared for crowds or else you might consider getting your food to go."
"First off: if you're coming here with Ethiopian food in mind, you're going to be disappointed. Though some sources state otherwise, it seems that Mike's brief experiment with shoehorning Ethiopian specialties into his menu is permanently finished. However, if you're looking to nurse a hangover after a night of bar-hopping in nearby University Heights, the menu here is frequently described as a tastier and cheaper version of '''Jim's Steakout'''. As you might have inferred from the full name of the place, steak is the marquee ingredient: Mike's claim to have invented the steak taco is dubious at best, but that doesn't make it any less delicious, and the ""Steak in the Hood"" hoagie comes with pork sausage in addition to the titular filling. Aside from steak, Mike's serves a full range of hot and cold subs, burgers, sausage sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, and tacos. They deliver, too."
"Founded in 1999 (hence the name) and located since 2003 on Bailey Avenue within walking distance of the '''South Campus''' of the '''University at Buffalo''', Pho 99 is Buffalo's first Vietnamese restaurant — and though it no longer can claim the title of the ''best'' place in town for this cuisine, it still does a brisk business especially with university students and faculty. Noodle bowls, fried rice plates, and meat-based entrees are all available, but this place's specialty is ''pho'', a Vietnamese soup made with rice noodles and flavored with bean sprouts, green chili peppers, basil and mint leaves, and lime juice. Raw beef is added to the soup; the piping hot broth cooks the beef before the soup is served. Consensus says the formerly impeccable quality of Pho 99's food took a hit after the place came under new management, but the fare here is still passable, and the service is friendly, if often slow."
"Kensington Avenue Pizzeria is a conundrum: locals' opinions on the place are among the most wildly mixed of any restaurant in Buffalo. They're equally likely to praise the deliciousness of the steak tacos and fettuccine Alfredo as to denounce the slow and inconsistent service, ""rough around the edges"" waitstaff, and high-ish prices. This place does earn points for their expansive menu, though — the sign outside the door reads ""the largest variety of pizzeria foods around"", which is too modest; this place's oeuvre spreads far beyond the realm of what you would usually find in a neighborhood pizza joint. Joining the usual stuff on the menu is a full range of hot and cold sandwiches, subs and burgers, Italian specialties like sausage cacciatore, shrimp scampi and various pasta dishes, Southern-style fried chicken, a selection of Greek souvlaki platters, steaks and porkchops, even Puerto Rican fare like ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil''. If you do feel like going the traditional route, though, the ""Kitchen Sink Pizza"" — with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham, onions, mushrooms, green and black olives, and sweet and hot peppers — is a winner if you're especially hungry. Breakfast is served daily till 2PM, and the place opens up on Sundays during football season to accommodate Bills fans."
"Every Friday evening at the '''Dnipro Center''' — an ethnic club and gathering place for Buffalo's Ukrainian community for over eighty years — the spacious ''rathskeller'' is converted to a restaurant serving a mix of Ukrainian and American specialties. While they're decently executed, the American foods on the menu are mostly simple, uninspired fare that you could find in any roadside diner — hot and cold sandwiches, main-course salads, chicken fingers and wings, heartier dinners centered more often than not on deep-fried seafood — but you're at the Dnipro Center, so it'd be a crime anyway not to go ethnic. Start off with an appetizer of ''borscht'', then choose from a slate of options that includes ''holubtsi'' (cabbage rolls), ''varenyky'' (Ukrainian-style pierogi), and more — or, if you're really hungry, opt for the ""UKE Combo"" which combines both of the above plus savory ''kovbasa'' sausage, tangy sauerkraut, and dark rye bread."
"At any time of day, you can come to this little place in Fillmore-Leroy — the old location of '''Taste of Soul''', which moved to Bailey Avenue in 2013 — for a full range of ""quick and delicious"" fast food, including burgers, chicken wings and fingers, pizza, tacos, hot and cold subs, and even Jamaican patties. But So Delicious also serves breakfast, and Saturday and Sunday evenings sees a heartier range of full-size soul-food dinners served up. The pleasant, well-lit dining room tops off the coziness of the So Delicious experience, decorated in warm hues of orange and brown."
"Located in the former home of '''Garris BBQ''' on William Street just outside of downtown, Taste of the Caribbean immediately took its place alongside '''Doctor Bird's Rasta-Rant''' and '''Caribbean Experience''' in the pantheon of Buffalo's best Jamaican restaurants when it opened in 2015. The menu doesn't stray too far from the standards — jerk chicken, escoveitch fish, oxtail, brown stew chicken, and various ""combo specials"" thereof, each of which come with peas and rice as well as your choice of two additional sides — and prices are a bit higher than the competition, but you get what you pay for. Everything is bursting with flavor: the jerk chicken is juicy, savory, and perfectly spiced (neither bland nor overpoweringly fiery); the peas and rice have an ineffably nutty aroma that is utterly tantalizing; even the steamed cabbage is delicious. Most of Taste of the Caribbean's business seems to be take-out, but there are about a dozen tables for seating in their dining room, which is brightly decorated with walls painted azure blue and colorful patterned tablecloths. Best of all, the grandmotherly Jamaican lady who works the counter is supremely friendly (she'll chat your ear off if you let her) and service is quick and efficient."
"Open six days a week for breakfast and lunch, the somewhat misleadingly named Tony's Ranch House is a neighborhood institution where the Pitliangas family has served a full range of Greek and American diner fare since 1981 to a loyal clientele comprised of a mixture of neighborhood regulars, '''Sisters' Hospital''' employees, and '''Canisius College''' students. The menu sticks to the basic burgers and melt sandwiches, but throws in a few Greek specialties for good measure: chicken and beef souvlaki, gyro, ''spanakopita'', ''baklava'' for dessert. Texas hots are on the menu too, the sauce sourced from a recipe that's been in the family since the 1950s. There's also a copious slate of breakfast options that includes homemade doughnuts and about a half-dozen specialty omelettes. The interior has been renovated and updated yet retains that classic homey ambience, but the quality of the food and service are merely average (and seem to be declining after the death of the longtime owner, George, a few years ago)."
"Serving up delicious Caribbean fare in a small, modest Jefferson Avenue storefront, Trini's clientele draws equally from neighborhood locals and '''Canisius College''''s student body. The menu is on the small side and, for those familiar with island cuisine, doesn't contain any surprises: curry chicken, jerk chicken wings, and oxtail are the best-loved options, but you can also get brown stew chicken, a variety of different ''roti'', and Jamaican patties with beef or chicken. Everything comes with heaping portions of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice on the side, and uniquely among area Caribbean restaurants, you can have the staff adjust the level of spiciness to your personal taste. Trini's ambience is strictly no-frills — food is served in Styrofoam trays and eaten with plastic silverware — but the staff is as friendly as can be, and the sweet strains of classic soca and calypso music complete the picture. They cater, too."
"Located on the inner edge of the Fruit Belt right next to the Medical Corridor, the unmissable Twisted Pickle (look for the neon-green plaster cow sculpture along Michigan Avenue; the effect is like nothing so much as a '''Chick-Fil-A''' advertisement) mostly does takeout and delivery for hospital employees and guests, though there are a few small, not-particularly-comfortable indoor tables. Jammed into an unassuming little building that used to be a doctor's office, the place is so named for the selection of ""specialty pickles"" they serve as appetizers: classic dill, garlic, hot and spicy, and Southern-style deep-fried pickles, all homemade. Other than that, though, the Twisted Pickle's oeuvre is pretty much your standard takeout fare — subs, burgers, wraps, main-course salads, tacos and fajitas, and pizza (whole or by the slice). Try the bacon dog, which is just what it sounds like: a hot dog bun filled with a locally-manufactured '''Sahlen's''' frankfurter and several slices of bacon. The food is passable but no great shakes, but the quick, friendly service and good prices make up for that. And, while you're waiting for your order to come up, you can play at one of the last remaining original '''Pac-Man''' arcade consoles in the Buffalo area."
"In May 2016, the long wait was finally over for the new occupant of the former Midtown home of '''Buffalo Steak & Seafood''' to be unveiled — and at the helm of the new operation was local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans. Here at The Big Easy, with the help of his fiancée-cum-head chef Lisa, he pays tribute to his newfound culinary obsession, and does so with aplomb: this place may not be able to compare with '''Shango''' or '''Toutant''' when it comes to upscale ambience, but in terms of authenticity it blows both of them out of the water. The Big Easy's menu offers a degree of variety without being overwhelming in length, and the ""deep-fried Southern mainstays"" (to borrow the words of one reviewer) you can order at the counter are dominated by a selection of po' boy sandwiches, which come in 6-inch or foot-long sizes and are filled with generous portions of meat and fixin's: shrimp, fried catfish, and Cajun chicken are the most popular selections, though you can also get a roast beef or hot smoked sausage sandwich. Seasoned fries come on the side in all cases. Elsewhere on the menu is easily Buffalo's most authentic take on the muffuletta sandwich; a distinctly Louisianian take on that Buffalo specialty, the fish fry (Southern-fried catfish takes the place of breaded haddock); and out-of-this-world bread pudding for dessert — but The Big Easy's customers reserve their highest praise for the seafood mac & cheese that's available as a side order (though the portions are so gargantuan it'd probably serve just as well as a main course); a perfectly cooked, creamy and saucy ambrosia with almost as much shrimp and crawfish as pasta. The Big Easy mostly does takeout business, but there's also a small, immaculately clean dining room with a few spartan yet comfy tables and chairs. Service here is enthusiastically helpful and friendly — these folks really go above and beyond in showing customers they appreciate their patronage."
"Since 1923, Chef's has been serving hearty Italian cuisine that is comparatively adventurous for neighborhood family-style establishments of its kind. Entrees range from familiar fare such as veal and chicken parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, and spaghetti to more elegant selections such as dandelion salad. Reasonable prices and generous portions. Buffalonians love this place."
"Buffalo is a place that's well-known for having great Italian food, but DiTondo's never seems to get its due as part of the cream of the crop. Maybe it's their odd hours; maybe it's because of '''Chef's''', its better-known neighbor on Seneca Street, drawing folks in a block before they get here. Whatever it is, lots of locals are missing out, so don't make the same mistake they do. There's a tiny little regular menu with maybe a half-dozen options on it, mostly homestyle, unpretentious red-sauce fare — everyone loves the chicken and spaghetti parm, covered with the thickest shell of melted mozzarella you've ever seen — but the daily specials are the real heart and soul of DiTondo's, which might consist of anything from hot sandwiches, to yummy main-course salads, to pasta in a marinara sauce that lacks the overt sweetness you'll find elsewhere in Buffalo. Whatever you order, expect hefty portions for blue-collar prices — and save room for the homemade custard pies, if they have any left (they're popular!) Best of all, DiTondo's friendly, no-nonsense, super-efficient service is a godsend for first-time visitors who aren't sure what to order. It bears emphasizing that they don't accept credit cards, and Friday is the only day they open for dinner — otherwise it's lunch only, but then again, that's probably when you want to come anyway (popular with Buffalo politicos and other heavy-hitters, lunch at DiTondo's is prime time for local celebrity-spotting!)"
"""Tastes Like Something"" is the (rather odd) motto here, and that ""something"" invariably consists of soul food classics cooked up to downhome perfection — ""as if I were having Sunday evening dinner at Big Momma's House"", in the words of one happy customer. Je Ne Sais Quoi opened in spring 2016 at the former Jefferson Avenue home of '''Mr. Bones' BBQ''' and instantly earned a devoted fanbase. You walk in from the ample parking lot and order from off the blackboard menu hanging on the wall: there's a small core list of permanent options (fried fish, chicken, and shrimp, barbecue ribs, and various combinations thereof) complemented by a revolving door of Southern-fried daily specials. Sides, of which two come with your meal, change daily as well. At Je Ne Sais Quoi the service is friendly as can be and the portions are generous, but prices are a bit higher than similar East Side soul food joints, and they do not accept credit cards."
"Located in the heart of Midtown, The Oakk Room boasts an environment that's sophisticated yet relaxed, and serves an upscale and Jamaican-influenced take on classic soul food — or, as one reviewer put it, ""comfort food jazzed with exotic spices"". The menu places a definite emphasis on seafood — there's crab cakes, fish and grits, and a beer-battered fish fry on Fridays — and the Caribbean influences come out to shine in options such as jerk chicken and curry fish. The Oakk Room's cocktail list also boasts around two dozen specialty martinis to choose from. Though the range of selections on the menu is small, the food is well-executed for the most part; service is attentive and friendly, and prices are good for what you get. The ambience can best be described as that of a classic old pub, ""lived-in"" yet well-kept and refined, and the clientèle is diverse."
"The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking is an odd but delicious hodgepodge: simple hot-off-the-grill fare like burgers, hot sub sandwiches, hot dogs and French fries rub elbows on the menu with succulent Southern specialties like barbecue ribs and mac & cheese, and they even serve Jamaican-style curry chicken. All this is dished out to you in a homey, unpretentious environment for budget-friendly prices."
"Take the respective halves of this place's name to mean ""Eastern Europe"" and ""Western New York"", and you'll have a pretty accurate idea of the menu here. At East-West Café, you're just as apt to nosh on Polish specialties like ''gołąbki'' (cabbage rolls), tangy ''czernina'' (duck blood soup), and huge, mouth-watering Polish sausage dogs that dwarf the buns they're served on (condiments are around the corner from the cash register) as you are to enjoy local favorites like beef on weck, fried bologna sandwiches or fish fry. Simple sandwich-shop fare like burgers, fries, subs, and melt sandwiches round out the menu, along with breakfast fare in the morning and sides such as chili mac and collard greens that add a soul food element to the mix. Service is quick and friendly."
"Since January 2015, Mahmuda Chowdhury and Sitara Arshad have been serving up ""Halal Income Halal Food"" (no exaggeration, prices are ''very'' good!) at this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market. South Asian specialties are the rule of thumb at Jafran — an ample selection of ''biryani'', Pakistani-style kebabs and ''kofta'', and tandoori chicken is featured — but you can also get familiar American fare like burgers, chicken and beef hoagies, pizza (plain cheese only), and even fish fry. All the food served at Jafran is ''jabeha'' halal, and on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the restaurant's separate entrance leading directly to Broadway enables it to stay open much later into the evening than the market itself."
"Though it served what was considered by many a Buffalo gourmand to be the best soul food in town, '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''' closed down in 2016, a victim of its own off-the-beaten-path location in a humble stall deep in the bowels of the '''Broadway Market'''. Flash forward a few months and its successor, Margie's, presents for the aficionado of downhome Southern cooking a scenario that's much the same as before — and, let's hope, a fate much different. Margie Hawkins is the eponymous owner/chef who brings to bear decades of familiarity with the savory ways of the cuisine of the American South that dates back to her childhood days, which she spent cooking for a crowded house of 21 brothers and sisters in her hometown of Selma, Alabama. Now, six days a week at the Market, she cooks up the most authentic takes on fried chicken (a breast and wing cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside), mac & cheese (as sinfully greasy and gooey as anything you'll find in the Deep South), barbecue ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender with a delightful tinge of raspberry in the glaze), and peach cobbler that you can find anywhere in the Niagara Frontier. Yes, just like before, but along with the aforementioned holdovers from McKenzie's menu are more esoteric regional specialties like pigs' trotters and oxtail that are worth a try if you're in a more adventurous mood. If you've ever been down South to a ""meat and three"" joint, the setup will be instantly familiar to you, but at Margie's it's ""meat and two"" — that is, you choose from a meat-based main course and two side dishes, plus cornbread and a biscuit, served to you cafeteria-style in styrofoam takeout containers for a flat price of $8. It doesn't get better than this."
"As the signs indicate, Potts Deli serves a combination of Polish and American fare. If you've been to the main location on Rossler Avenue in Cheektowaga, you'll notice that the menu at the Broadway Market satellite is abbreviated and tilts more heavily toward standard American comfort food — but you'll also be pleased to know that the award-winning quality of the huge pierogies remains unscathed (don't be put off by the price; you get what you pay for in terms of both size and quality). If you're in the mood to eat Polish, you can also opt for ''gołąbki'', smoked ''kielbasa'' (no fresh, sadly), or a ""Polish platter"" that combines all three with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes on the side. As for Potts' American selections, you've got a workmanlike slate of standard diner options punctuated by local favorites like fried bologna and '''Wardynski's''' hot dogs. Whatever you order, it's served up with businesslike efficiency in a friendly, folksy environment pleasantly secluded from the rest of the market."
"Going strong for over 80 years, R&L Lounge is an honest-to-goodness throwback to old Polonia, courtesy of inimitable owners Ronnie and Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969. Perhaps the best description of dinner at R&L was given by the reviewer who compared it to ""sitting around the kitchen table with relatives"", and grandmotherly barkeep Lottie is nothing if not fully engaged with her customers — the philosophy she expounded on in a May 2010 writeup in the ''Buffalo News'' (""A bartender is like a psychiatrist... a lot of bars don't make it because they're not trained to be people's people; they're only trained to pour drinks"") means that she's liable to come over to your table and talk your ear off, dishing on the latest neighborhood gossip or showing off old family photos. The ambience — original tin ceiling, homey wood-paneled walls where old Genesee Beer ads share space with tacked-up pictures of the Virgin Mary — completes the old-school picture. As for the food, R&L's menu is limited in size but impeccable in quality: Lottie's take on ''gołąbki'' is light as air and delicious, and her handmade pierogi are elegant in their simplicity, standing up well on their own merits without any of the traditional accompaniments like sautéed onions and sour cream. Most popular of all, though, are the Friday fish fries — it's standing room only during Lent as folks from all over Western New York stream back into the old neighborhood to feast on these delicately tasty haddock filets, and R&L stays open well into the evening to accommodate them. Keep in mind that this is a small, family-run operation, so the place sometimes closes without notice and can run out of food on a particularly busy day. It's always best to call ahead."
"Lucky's Texas Hots is a neighborhood institution in Kaisertown, serving up ""slime dogs"" and other fresh-off-the-grill goodies seemingly forever at their humble Clinton Street storefront. The local specialty that makes up 75% of the restaurant's name is Lucky's main claim to fame, but its variation of the Texas hot doesn't quite stack up: local consensus says the sauce has a bland, somewhat off-putting flavor. You're better off sticking to the other offerings, which consist of summery fare like grilled chicken sandwiches, sausage dogs, burgers, and Philly-style cheesesteak sandwiches. An upside is that service is friendly and efficient, and breakfast is served all day."
"They stay ""stick to what you know"", and Neapolis Family Restaurant follows that credo to a tee: leaving the cutting-edge haute cuisine to the other guys, the name of the game here is familiar homestyle diner fare, served with a smile in a spacious dining room that's humble but clean and well-kept — ""the prototypical family restaurant"", in the words of one reviewer. To describe Neapolis as a Buffalo-style Greek diner would be technically true but a bit misleading; the souvlaki, Greek salad, and so forth that's on the menu actually pales in comparison to their classic all-American offerings, such as a range of burgers and melt sandwiches, corned-beef hash, and mind-blowing milkshakes made the old-fashioned way. Breakfast starts early and continues all day, with a workmanlike slate of pancakes, omelettes, and egg-meat-and-toast permutations augmented by delicious homemade pastry. Hearty dinner platters are added to the menu on Friday nights, when they stay open past lunchtime until 8PM. Service at this family-owned stalwart can sometimes be slow, but it's always extremely friendly, with a genuine personal touch — come in a few times and they'll remember your name for years — and the food is ''cheap''. A real hidden gem, this place is."
"The satellite location of '''Doctor Bird's Caribbean Rasta-Rant''' presents a somewhat different scenario than at its big sister in University Heights. For one, the selection is quite a bit more narrow — there's a wide range of Jamaican patties on offer, including several choices for vegetarians, but the rest of the menu is made up of two different types of ''rotis'' as well as a few dinner platters; curry chicken or beef, oxtail, and haddock come with sides of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice. On the other hand, the Caribbean Corner also boasts a selection of packaged ingredients for those who'd like to try their own hand at island cookery, including jerk spice and an impressive array of other spice blends. There's also snacks, pop, cigarettes, and other bodega items."
"Six days of the week, the Happy Swallow enjoys a placid existence as an neighborhood gin mill that is (in the words of '''Forgotten Buffalo Tours''') ""a rare survivor of the 'family-owned tavern' era"" on the East Side, with longtime owner Tommy Golinowski pouring tall cold ones for a dwindling population of regulars in a homey, wood-paneled interior that's as old-school as it gets. But on Friday evenings only, the kitchen opens up and visitors flock in to enjoy hearty, homestyle Polish dinners at prices that take you back almost as many years as the Happy Swallow itself — this is an experience that was once common in Buffalo but is getting harder and harder to find, so don't miss this place if you can help it. At dinnertime, fish fry is the main attraction, especially during Lent; it comes in either yellow pike or traditional haddock, breaded or battered, and it's ''really good''. Also on the menu is fried shrimp and scallops, plus a grand seafood platter that includes both of those plus a half-serving of fish. Pierogies (with cheese, sauerkraut or potato), roast beef, and other specialties are served too, and all dinners come with heaping sides of fries, coleslaw, American or German potato salad, macaroni salad, and bread and butter."
"Ike's is just a tiny little takeout joint on a desolate stretch of Genesee Street that's only open three days a week, but the Southern-style barbecue fare they dish out is so good that it'd be unthinkable to leave them out of this article. In case you couldn't figure it out from the name of this place, at Ike & BG's the name of the game is ribs — meaty, mouthwatering half- and full racks of pork ribs come slathered with a super-spicy hot barbecue sauce that ""will burn your soul"", in the words of one especially feisty reviewer. There's also dinner specials of fried or barbecued chicken, barbecue fish, steak hoagies, and more. And don't forget the mac and cheese, coleslaw, and other stick-to-your-ribs (no pun intended!) sides."
"Since 1969, Lee's has been dishing out what many people call the ""best barbecue in Buffalo"" out of a old converted clapboard house in the heart of Humboldt Park. As usual with this type of cuisine, the key is the sauce, and rather than the sticky-sweet, tomato-based Kansas City- and Memphis-style sauces typical to barbecue joints around here, Lee's stands alone in Buffalo with an East Carolina-style sauce: a thin sauce with a vinegar base, spicy and sharp in flavor with no tomato at all. You can get extra sauce with your meal for $1, and be assured: you ''will'' want some. The menu is simple and straightforward, with top billing given to pork ribs and shoulder available either as a sandwich or a dinner platter with coleslaw, potato salad, or French fries on the side. Portions are huge, and though the quality of the meat is somewhat inconsistent, most of the time it's topnotch: meaty, fall-off-the-bone tender, and — most importantly — always saucy. Lee's also serves barbecued half-chicken, chicken fingers and wings, and haddock dinners that are especially popular on Fridays."
"The specialty that put Ms. Goodies on the map is something they call the ""junkyard dog"", which is a hard concept to wrap your head around at first — sort of a cross between a hot dog, a taco, and a fish fry, this odd concoction consists of a fried haddock filet, French fries, and coleslaw slathered with hot sauce and stuffed into a flour tortilla. But it's delicious enough to have won multiple awards at the '''Taste of Buffalo'''. But the junkyard dog is only the beginning of the story at Ms. Goodies. Breakfast and lunch is the time to come to this Bailey Avenue dive; respectively, you can indulge in delicious Southern-style chicken and waffles or a create-your-own-breakfast option with eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, grits and more as building blocks, or avail yourself of hot-off-the-grill hot dogs, burgers and fries. As well, if you're after a soul-food take on Buffalo fish fry, Ms. Goodies stays open for dinner on Friday nights with a menu that also includes fried chicken, mac & cheese, sweet potato pie, and other downhome treats."
"The two big selling points that owners Mattie and Butch Holt use to tout their Fillmore Avenue hole-in-the-wall are ""the best breakfast in Buffalo"" and ""great soul food you'll have to taste to believe"", and true to their word, those are the two things Mattie's does best. In the morning you can get eggs served with your choice of breakfast meat plus grits and home fries on the side, as well as breakfast sandwiches, pancakes and waffles, corned beef hash, and more — all whipped up skillfully and with aplomb. At lunchtime the focus shifts to hearty Southern-fried specialties like mac & cheese, fried catfish, collard greens, and some of the most delectable fried chicken you've ever tasted: the perfect combination of crispy exterior and moist, tender interior. The downside of Mattie's is the other foods on their menu — standard lunchtime fare like burgers, subs and hot dogs are just okay — as well as the prices, which are way higher than the competition. Also, while the neighborhood old-timers that congregate here are as friendly as can be, the same can't be said of the service. Folks have been known to get overcharged here, too, so beware."
"In the midst of the ""food desert"" of the East Side, where the nearest full-service supermarket is often miles away and the poor often subsist on what they can get from the local corner bodega, fresh fruits and vegetables are, understandably, often hard to come by. From a health-care perspective, that's bad news — and that's why, in 2010, the '''Erie County Medical Center''' launched this neighborhood farmer's market aimed at helping the residents of one of Buffalo's most economically deprived neighborhoods to improve their dietary habits. Much more than just a half-dozen or so vendors of fresh produce, prepared foods, and artisanal goods, the ECMC Farmers' Market is also a place for fun and educational events with an overarching theme of promoting a healthy lifestyle — there's everything from ''tai chi'' demonstrations, to dance and cooking classes, to seed and plant giveaways for those who want to try their hand at gardening. Food trucks are on hand for those who work up an appetite browsing through the greenery."
"Come to this artisanal nanobrewery in the Ellicott District to enjoy any of their four flagship brews on draft plus a changing selection of seasonal offerings, stay for a pretty impressive collection of artifacts from Buffalo's long and storied brewing history."
"Located on a quiet residential side street in Lovejoy, the Moreland Guest House boasts inexpensive yet secure and high-quality accommodation for budget travelers. Single or double rooms are available, with complimentary satellite television and high-speed wireless Internet. The bathrooms are shared, dormitory-style, and a kitchen and common room is available. On-site parking can be had for a nominal fee, but on-street parking is free and nearly always easy to find. The Moreland Guest House enforces a minimum stay of 3 nights, and a maximum of two guests per room."
"The Erie County Medical Center has a history that stretches back to 1902, when the city government founded it under the name '''Buffalo Municipal Hospital''' to treat victims of a smallpox epidemic. It moved from East Ferry Street to its current location ten years later, kicking off a vigorous campaign of expansion under the leadership of Dr. Edward Meyer, and took on its present name after its operations were taken over by Erie County in the 1970s. Today, ECMC is the largest single hospital in Buffalo, with 602 inpatient beds, and is an important teaching facility for '''UB Medical School''', with many faculty members doubling as doctors and other caregivers. ECMC is Western New York's designated treatment center for trauma care and HIV/AIDS treatment, and is also renowned for its specialization in transplantation, burn care, mental health services, and rehabilitation."
"Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity was founded in 1848 by Bishop John Timon: one of many charitable institutions he put in place for the benefit of Buffalo's Catholic community, which at the time consisted mostly of the desperately poor Irish immigrants of the First Ward. The hospital was run at first by a staff of nuns from the Sisters of Charity (hence its name) and moved to its current location in Fillmore-Leroy in 1876. In the present day, Sisters is the flagship facility of '''Catholic Health System of Buffalo''', with 586 beds between its main location and its branch hospital in Cheektowaga. It provides a wide range of medical and surgical care but is particularly well-known as an excellent maternity hospital."

"Pastor William Bunton is the minister of this congregation whose rousing services provide a warm, loving, and welcoming environment for all. Services are held in the huge, copper-topped former home of ''' St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church''' on Fillmore Avenue in Humboldt Park, which you can read more about in Wikivoyage's '''Historic Churches of Buffalo's East Side''' itinerary."
"Founded in 1831, Bethel AME Church is the oldest black religious congregation in Buffalo, predating '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' by six years. Like its counterpart, Bethel's original home on Vine Alley once served as a station on the Underground Railroad. Since 1953, they've worshiped in the former '''Presbyterian Church of the Covenant''' in Cold Spring, a Gothic-style building erected in 1903. Bethel's pastor, the Rev. Richard Stenhouse, not only leads electrifying services but is also a powerful force in the improvement of the lives of his flock and the community at large — through the church, '''Bethel Head Start''' provides quality preschool education to disadvantaged Buffalo children, '''Bethel Community Development Corporation''' has built several dozen new single-family homes around Cold Spring for struggling families, and there's even a community credit union."
"An unmistakable beacon in Midtown with its metallic modernist facade and huge animated LED sign flashing onto Main Street, Bethesda World Harvest International Church's history is anything but recent: its roots stretch back to the 1930s, when Elva and Richard White, a husband-and-wife team of traveling revivalist preachers, settled down in Buffalo and founded what was at first known as the Bethesda Revival Center. These days, it's not only a church in its own right where Bishop Michael Badger leads services every Sunday morning, but also the headquarters of the '''Bethesda Fellowship of Churches''', a nationwide network of religious communities specializing in humanitarian and missionary work in Africa."
"The dispute facing Bethel AME Church at the turn of the century — whether they should continue meeting in the traditional heart of Buffalo's black community, or move away from what had since become a seedy red-light district — was so controversial that it ended up splitting the congregation in half, giving birth in 1901 to what was first called '''St. Luke's AME Zion Church''' and later renamed in honor of their longtime Pastor, Rev. Henry Durham, after his death. Their current church building, a charming little brick Gothic church in the Ellicott District, was erected in 1920 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places — and it still packs them in every Sunday morning to hear Pastor George Woodruff preach."
"Emmanuel Temple Seventh Day Adventist Church is a vibrant congregation that welcomes newcomers and visitors with open arms to their beautiful Saturday-morning services with a positive and inspirational message that carries them through their week. They've been doing their thing since 1958 in the former home of '''St. Stephen's Evangelical Church''' in the western reaches of Broadway-Fillmore — a medium-sized, red-brick Gothic building erected in 1911 whose steeple still contains its original Howard clock and three bells cast by the '''Kimberly & Meneelee''' Company of Troy, New York."
"The Rev. Dr. T. Anthony Bronner is a Philadelphia native who first cut his teeth in the local faith community as pastor of '''Calvary Baptist Church''' in Humboldt Park. In 1999, he struck out on his own to found this huge, vibrant congregation, expanding to Rochester with its identically-named sister church three years later. Elim is truly a church for the 21st Century — it meets in a huge, warehouse-like building tucked away on a side street in Fillmore-Leroy, engaging a tech-savvy audience with modern-style services live-streamed over the Internet that feature sermons reposted weekly on social media. As well, this is a congregation that truly goes the extra mile in making folks feel welcomed and like a member of the family, whether they're regular attendees or first-timers."
"The friendly community of Faith Missionary Baptist Church has been led since 1981 by Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister: this pillar of the local community has not only ably stewarded his congregation, expanding and modernizing his church campus, but has also partnered with local not-for-profits and the city and county governments to establish educational, housing, and community service programs to benefit all residents of the East Side. His church on Humboldt Parkway is the site of frequent fellowship meetings, potluck dinners, and other events to engage his flock and others far beyond Sunday mornings. The red neon cross that lights up Humboldt Parkway from the entrance may be unmistakably Christian, but the building that houses Faith Baptist started out as the nucleus of the early-20th Century Hamlin Park Jewish community: this was where '''Temple Beth David''' met until 1955. It's a handsome, beige brick building erected in 1924 in a style that mixes the Neoclassical with the Georgian Revival: the baskethandle arches atop the stained glass windows on the sides testify to the former, while the latter is represented by a huge Palladian stained-glass window above the entrance that still boasts a proud Star of David in white and blue."
"This dynamic congregation is led by Pastor John Young, a veteran leader of a number of black churches who styles himself ""The Comeback Kid"". After selling their building in Midtown — a facility most famous for housing the WKBW television studios for the first couple of decades of the station's existence — Fellowship World found its new home in Humboldt Park, at the handsome brick Gothic edifice built in 1895 for the '''Emmanuel Evangelical Reformed Church'''. However, the same as before, in addition to church services and a myriad of community programs Fellowship Christian Center also operates the Totally Gospel Radio Network, which broadcasts locally on WFWO 89.7 FM."
"Friendship Missionary Baptist Church is a neighborhood institution that's been going strong for over a century: it has been housed in three separate buildings since its establishment in 1913, but true to the neighborhood that nurtured it, all of those buildings have been located on or near Clinton Street in the Ellicott District. Almost as storied as the history of the church itself is the history of the welfare institutions it's sponsored for the local area: from the community grocery store it ran in the Depression years to its status as the first black church in Buffalo to evangelize over the radio airwaves beginning in the 1940s, and right through today with the community educational initiatives, food banks, and other programs maintained by Reverend Edward Jackson. But of course, the Sunday morning services, where longtime members as well as visitors are welcome to a seat at the table, remain the heart and soul of Friendship Baptist — they take place in a brick building dating from 1954 that, like the congregation itself, blends tradition with modernity."
"Macedonia Baptist Church's twin emphases are inclusivity and evangelism. Here, visitors and new members are not so much welcomed with open arms as infused with a sensation of suddenly finding one's long-lost family, which dovetails nicely with their goal of spreading the good news of their faith by engaging with the community in myriad different ways, at services as well as with scholarship programs, food drives, and other community betterment efforts. Pastor Herman Alston is the one who carries on the church's long tradition: founded in 1921, it bounced around various locations around the area (including most notably a spell in the 1970s, '80s and '90s at the historic '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''') before landing in the old '''Masten Park Baptist Church''' on East North Street in the Fruit Belt: a simple yet striking English Gothic building erected in 1932 using local limestone."
"Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers, may have only been at the pulpit since 2015, but already he's making his mark — a true man of the people, he's the living embodiment of its identity as a ""Bible-believing, Bible-teaching, Bible-preaching Baptist church where all are welcomes and embraced in Godly love"" — engaged, outgoing, and on friendly terms with the regulars in his congregation. The place to be on Sunday mornings is the former '''Concordia Lutheran Church''' on Northampton Street in Cold Spring, an ample-sized, red-brick Gothic church built in 1903 to a design by local architect Jacob Oberkircher."
"Pastor Joe Fisher is the man of the hour ever Sunday morning at this pleasant, homey church in the Ellicott District. Pleasant Grove Baptist Church's history can be traced back to 1918, but its present building is relatively newer: erected in 1977 from a design by Wallace Moll, one of the biggest names in the unsung late-20th Century Buffalo architectural community, Pleasant Grove's interior is brightly lit and centered on a modern-style, cross-shaped stained glass window above the altar."
"Affiliated with the American Baptist Convention, St. John's is a congregation whose humble roots — the first service was helmed by Rev. Burnie McCarley in a tiny storefront in Broadway-Fillmore and attended by a congregation that numbered four — belie its modern-day status as a true mover and shaker among Buffalo's African-American faith community. As much a community service organization as a religious community, St. John's 45-acre (18 ha) campus on the west edge of the Fruit Belt comprises not only the church itself — a colorful, brightly-lit, modern structure that's a well-known landmark in the blocks east of downtown — but also '''McCarley Gardens''', a development of 150 affordable townhouses that's about as well-kept and safe as public housing in Buffalo gets, '''St. John Tower''', a nine-story senior citizens' apartment complex, and the '''Rev. Dr. Bennett W. Smith Family Life Center''', a large facility that hosts recreational and educational events open to the community."
"Without question, True Bethel Baptist Church is the preeminent African-American religious congregation in Buffalo — and without question, its pastor, the Rev. Darius Pridgen, is the city's most powerful black preacher, serving also as a philanthropist (the church operates numerous charities including a food pantry, thrift shop, emergency housing service, and vocational rehabilitation for the homeless), preservationist (his financial backing was instrumental in the recently-completed restoration of the old '''Michigan Street Baptist Church'''), forceful mouthpiece for the African-American community in Buffalo, and, since 2011, in the city government as president of the Buffalo Common Council. True Bethel is actually three churches in one, with two locations in Buffalo and one in Niagara Falls, but it's the East Ferry Street location that's the biggest — a huge megachurch the size of a Walmart, with an attached '''Subway''' sandwich shop and room for almost five thousand worshippers, the massive scale of this place is a perfect reflection of the outsize stature of its head honcho. The three services held here every Sunday are energetic, empowering, and speak to the contemporary concerns of modern-day African-Americans and Christians in general. And don't worry if you can't make it down for one of them — you can also listen to services live on the radio on '''WUFO''' 1080 AM, or watch them on Time Warner Cable channel 20 or streaming on the Web."
"Located in the heart of Fillmore-Leroy since 1907, Blessed Trinity's congregation worships in an exquisite brown-brick building: its architecture an imitation of the '''Cathédrale Saint-Trophine''' in Arles adapted to the style of a 12th-century Lombard cathedral, it's said to have the most plentiful terra cotta ornamentation of any church in the U.S."
"Second only to '''St. Stanislaus''' on the roster of Polonia's most prominent Catholic churches, Corpus Christi boasts a vibrant faith community, a full schedule of English- and Polish-language church services, and cultural events for the surrounding neighborhood including the annual '''Dożynki''' harvest festival held in August."
"The traditional church of Kaisertown's German community, St. Bernard's history dates back to 1907, before which time the newcomers had to either worship with their Polish rivals at '''St. Casimir's''' or make the long trek across the railroad tracks to '''St. Agnes''' in Lovejoy. More recently, the church successfully fought off an attempt by the Diocese to merge it with '''Our Lady of Czestochowa''' in Cheektowaga, and this understated English Gothic-style building erected in 1953 remains today the home of a congregation that's on the small side, but vital and welcoming to all."
"St. Casimir is no longer a full-fledged parish: in 2011, its congregation was merged with '''Our Lady of Czestochowa''' in Cheektowaga and the building became an '''oratory''', or a secondary worship space used by its parent church for special-event Masses, weddings, funerals, and other functions. However, as oratories go, St. Casimir's is an unusually active one: this exquisite Byzantine Revival building in polychromatic terra cotta hosts six Masses a week as well as a full slate of community events and services (including a raucous '''Dyngus Day''' shindig) that preserve its status as the nexus of Kaisertown's Polish community."
"The story of this proud congregation is the story of the historic linchpin churches of two adjacent but very different neighborhoods: '''St. Brigid's''', founded in 1853 as the ""mother church"" of the Irish immigrant community of South Buffalo and located for years on Louisiana Street in the Old First Ward, and '''St. Columba''', which served the Italians of the Ellicott District beginning in 1888 and was famous for years as the site of the '''Printers' Mass''', an extra-late service at 1:30AM on Sunday nights held especially for the newspaper printers whose shifts ended just before that hour. The two churches merged in 1968 after St. Brigid's was destroyed by fire, and today SS. Columba and Brigid is a friendly and welcoming Near East Side church with a congregation that draws heavily from the newly minted Hispanic quarter of the Ellicott District, and which strives to use its ""contagious Christianity"" as a positive force in the lives of all who enter."
"St. John Kanty has been anchoring the eastern part of Broadway-Fillmore since 1890, when Bishop Stephen Ryan had had enough of hearing about parishioners of '''St. Stanislaus''' killed on their walk to church while crossing the dangerous '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks that divided the neighborhood. Despite the fact that its building lacks the architectural majesty of many of Polonia's older churches, St. John Kanty counts a congregation that's among the East Side's most vibrant — aside from the half-dozen Masses held here each week, the church remains a powerful force in Buffalo's Polish community through its sponsorship of a bevy of community services for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. It continues to grow, too, accepting the former members of '''St. Adalbert's Basilica''' into the fold when the two churches merged in 2011."
"St. Katharine Drexel is a new parish, formed in 2007 from the merger of Lovejoy's three Catholic churches: '''St. Agnes''', '''Visitation''', and '''St. Francis of Assisi'''. The new congregation meets in the former home of the latter church, a newish building in a modernized and simplified interpretation of the English Gothic style that's stood on North Ogden Street since 1959. As well, the new name of the parish is a sort of homage to its former namesake: canonized in 2000, Katharine Drexel is a new-school saint who, in turn-of-the-century Philadelphia, worked tirelessly in the spirit of St. Francis for the benefit of the urban poor and against the racial segregation and prejudice that ruled the day."
"St. Lawrence Church is located just inside the city line in Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles. '''St. Gerard''', located at the intersection that gave the neighborhood its name, was their church, but as Delavan-Bailey grew in population it became too small to accommodate all the congregants. Thus St. Lawrence was founded as a mission church in 1914, graduating to the status of full-fledged parish in its own right in 1929. Today it is a small but diverse and friendly congregation that's welcoming to visitors and active in the community."
"From the 1990s through today, the story of the Catholic churches on the inner East Side was one of shrinking congregations and of churches closing and merging with each other. St. Martin de Porres is one of the East Side's first ""blended churches"" — a merger of '''St. Matthew''' in Genesee-Moselle, '''Our Lady of Lourdes''' in Midtown, '''St. Boniface''' in the Fruit Belt, and '''St. Benedict the Moor''' in Cold Spring — and it's unique among them in that the merger came at the request of the parishes, rather than being imposed on them by the Diocese. When the building they call home today was dedicated by Bishop Henry Mansell in 2000, it was the first new Catholic church in 50 years to be built within the city limits. Another way St. Martin de Porres is unique is as Buffalo's only majority-black Catholic church, and among the ways it tailors its ministry to the worship culture it serves is with a rousing gospel choir headed since the parish's inception by the inimitable Ella Robinson, as well as an '''African-American Catholic Gospel Music Resource and Recording Center''' slated for the Parish Center they plan to build on their Humboldt Park campus."
"The most well-known and vibrant Catholic church on the East Side, this ""Mother Church of Polonia"" has stubbornly retained its status as central hub of the community in Broadway-Fillmore. St. Stan's is best known among locals as a place to celebrate Dyngus Day or trek with your old Polish grandma on Easter, Christmas and other holidays — but it's an equally magnificent experience other times of the year, when it's just you and the neighborhood regulars. For an extra dose of old-school neighborhood authenticity, go to St. Stan's Polish-language service, held at noon every Sunday."
"The seat of the Buffalo Deanery of the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''', St. Nicholas serves a cluster of Ukrainians located in Lovejoy whose history dates back to the early 1880s. It was Reverend Iwan Zaklynskyj who was the church's founding father — in 1905, he and a group that broke away from the congregation of '''SS. Peter & Paul''' on Ideal Street after its ethnic composition shifted began meeting in a small wood-frame structure on Central Avenue. The present building, a Romanesque-style beauty in Broadway-Fillmore designed by prominent East Side architect Wladyslaw Zawadzki, dates to 1919. Today, St. Nicholas — along with the '''Dnipro Center''' on Genesee Street — is one of the twin nuclei of Buffalo's under-the-radar but vibrant Ukrainian-American community: the church plays host not only to weekly services but also fun-filled community events and, on Friday afternoons, to the '''St. Nicholas Friday Kitchen''', where ''varenyky'', ''borscht'', and other lip-smacking Ukrainian specialties are dished out for a song. St. Nicholas is also the sponsor of the ""Good Samaritan"" radio show broadcast Sunday afternoons on '''WJJL 1440 AM''', broadcasting inspirational religious programming in both Ukrainian and English."
"Though it was founded in 1884 as a Ukrainian congregation, SS. Peter & Paul became dominated in short order by Russians, who began immigrating to Buffalo in the 1880s and were attracted to Lovejoy due to easily available jobs on the railroads. The departure of the Ukrainians for a separate congregation in 1905 cemented SS. Peter & Paul's status as the first Russian Orthodox church on the Niagara Frontier (these days it's affiliated with the '''Orthodox Church in America'''). The congregation continued to grow throughout the 20th Century and into the 21st, accommodating an influx of refugees from the former Soviet Union, and the richly decorated Russian Byzantine-style building in which it meets today, with its unmistakable onion dome, dates to 1933. Visitors to SS. Peter & Paul today will encounter a congregation that is close-knit yet welcoming to newcomers, with uplifting services held in a mix of English and Old Slavonic."
"A small and close-knit faith community whose ethnic diversity mirrors that of the neighborhood it calls home, this church was founded in 1925 as the '''Cleveland Hill Evangelical United Brethren Church''' and has worshiped in its present building, a simple, modern-style brick and stone church in Kensington-Bailey, since 1949. Today, Pastor Holly Dale-Coty leads a congregation that is active in the community and enthusiastically welcoming of visitors and newcomers."
"The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''' has been a mainstay in Delavan-Grider for over a century: the congregation still worships in its original brick Carpenter Gothic building erected in 1915. Today, Pastor Larry Jackson leads Sunday services that are friendly and imbued with a positive and uplifting message, and continues the tradition of community engagement that's been one of Grace's trademarks from the start: potluck dinners, lively choir concerts, and other events are frequent and well-attended."
"Affiiliated with the Lutheran Church — Missouri Synod, Hananiah is a new congregation that's led by Reverend Kenyatta Cobb, who doubles as a chaplain for the Buffalo Police Department and the '''Erie County Medical Center'''. Since 2007, they've been based in the former '''A. L. Weber Furniture Store''' on Genesee Street in Humboldt Park, with services whose style blends respect for tradition with innovations that speak to modern Christians. Hananiah Lutheran Church is a small congregation, but it boasts an outsize commitment to community service — their food pantry serves the neighborhood Monday through Thursday — and an ethnically diverse makeup."
"Affiliated with the Karen Baptist Convention, it was in 2015 when pastor Myo Kyow moved his flock from their former home on the West Side to the erstwhile '''St. James Catholic Church''' in Kensington-Bailey: a hulking English Gothic structure designed by Karl Schmill and built in 1926 for a mixed German and Irish congregation on what was then the outskirts of Buffalo's urbanized area. As before, Hermon Karen Baptist serves as spiritual home to a growing contingent of Buffalo's Burmese immigrant community, whom Pastor Kyow and company actively engage with friendly services, a host of worthwhile events, and group meetings sponsored by a wide range of community groups."
"Immanuel is a pint-sized congregation — over the course of its history, it's never had much more than the two or three dozen members it boasts now — so it's pretty impressive that the church has been able to hang tough in Lovejoy for over 120 years. The congregation was founded in 1894 with services held in German for the first twenty years of its history, and it moved to its current location — the former '''St. Peter's Episcopal Church''' — in 1951. Headed up today by pastor Glen Richardson, Immanuel may be a small church, but the community is friendly and welcoming to visitors. It's affiliated with the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church."
"Lincoln Memorial UMC is a handsome stone church in the English Gothic style, built in 1921 for the '''Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church''' and situated in a verdant milieu in Hamlin Park. At Lincoln, not only does the congregation bend over backwards to welcome and accommodate newcomers, but Pastor George Nicholas is uncommonly talented at crafting sermons whose messages cut across all types of people and walks of life to touch all hearts. There's even a coffee hour after services."
"Founded in 1920 as the '''Bailey Avenue Presbyterian Church''' and renamed six years later after the death of their founding pastor, MacAlpine has been a tried-and-true stalwart in Kensington-Bailey all throughout the changes the neighborhood has undergone over the years. Reverend Lowell Avery is a true dynamo, leading his church not only in rousing Sunday-morning services but in a full range of community programs and ministries."
"Much the same as '''St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church''' just on the other side of Humboldt Parkway, the story of Metropolitan UMC is one of five struggling, shrinking inner-city congregations — '''St. Andrew's''', '''Bithynia''', '''Good Shepherd''', '''Masten Community''', and '''Otterbein''' — pooling their resources and merging together to keep the flame of their faith alive in the midst of a changing neighborhood. The building, erected in 1981 on the site of the demolished '''Humboldt Square Evangelical Church''' (later temporary home to predecessor congregation Good Shepherd), is a handsome building in a modernist style; the congregation is small and tight-knit yet friendly and welcoming; the services are helmed weekly by Pastor Angela Stewart."
"Like '''Durham Memorial AME Zion Church''', New Covenant UCC's history can be traced back to the controversy among members of '''Bethel AME Church''' over the undesirable location of their place of worship in what was then Buffalo's red-light district. Desiring to go one step beyond Durham's solution and dispense with Methodism entirely, this church was founded in 1904 and met in a converted house on Potter Street (now Nash Street) donated by one Mr. William Lloyd, hence its original name '''Lloyd's Memorial Congregational Church'''. The congregation moved to its present building in the Ellicott District in 1964 and took on its current name ten years later after merging with '''St. Peter's Evangelical Church'''. New Covenant remains a very active congregation both at Sunday services and in the community at large, with a neighborhood food pantry, an active music ministry, and frequent guest speakers and other events. The congregation is very welcoming to visitors and new members, too."
"Though you'd never know it from its low-key reputation, St. Philip's is one of the East Side's most historic churches: founded in 1861, it is one of the district's oldest extant congregations, and was the first (and is still the only) majority-black congregation in the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York. They worshiped for years on Goodell Street in the Fruit Belt before their building fell victim to urban renewal in 1974, and their current home is the former '''St. Clement's Episcopal Church''' in Delavan-Grider. Services at St. Philip's blend the traditionally Episcopalian with twists that speak to the African-American identity of its members — for example, there's both a traditional and a gospel choir — and St. Philip's is also the home church of the local chapter of the '''Union of Black Episcopalians'''. There are two services a week led by the dynamic Rev. Gloria Payne-Carter."
"With a history that stretches back to 1918, the University Methodist Church has been a linchpin presence at the north end of Kensington-Bailey for far longer than most anything else in the neighborhood. Though services are still held in its original, imposing red-brick Gothic building, the church is now linked together with the nearby '''Cleveland Hill United Methodist Church''' — the two congregations share the same pastor, the Rev. Holly Dale-Coty, as well as the same outsize vitality and spirit of community engagement that belie the small size of the flock, and the same warm welcome for visitors."
"In 2014, the erstwhile '''Expressway Assembly of God''' — located in Kensington-Bailey, in an old factory building just off the Eggert Road exit of the '''Kensington Expressway''', hence its name — became part of the CityReach Network, a group of several dozen churches located throughout the eastern United States whose mission is to bring the Christian message to ""unlikely people in overlooked place"". Accordingly, Pastor Lou Krutz and his cohorts foster an accepting, low-key, come-as-you-are environment in their services, with a special focus on ministering to youth and young adults: a nursery and Children's Church are available during regular Sunday services, and teens and young adults are catered to during Tuesday and Wednesday night programs, respectively. In order to represent their faith to the community in the best possible way, CityReach goes far beyond simply welcoming new members: they actively and enthusiastically encourage visitors to check out what they're all about."
"In the beginning, this was the '''First Russian-Ukrainian Baptist Church''', where a few dozen people met each week to conduct services in the Russian language. As Lovejoy changed and diversified, the church began accepting folks of other ethnicities into the fold and holding services in English; finally, in 1951, the much larger congregation moved into the striking modern building the worship in today. Despite that, the core message has remained the same: the Evangelical Baptist Church is a friendly, fundamentalist Christian congregation that's extraordinarily committed to their faith. Pastor John Carpenter leads weekly services at which all are welcome."
"An interdenominational, full-Gospel Christian congregation that is welcoming and open to all, at the First Universal Christian Church husband-and-wife pastor team Rob and Sue Bradbury preach services with a positive, empowering message, with a contemporary-style delivery that's not bogged down in intimidating pomp and ceremony but is laid-back, accessible, and relevant to modern-day life. The building is the former '''Magyar Reformed Church''', a charming red-brick Gothic church built in 1915 where the small Hungarian community of eastern Kaisertown worshiped for many years."
"Situated in the former '''John Ulinski Senior Center''' at the corner of Stanislaus Street and Woltz Avenue in Broadway-Fillmore, the Buffalo Markaz Masjid is not only as a mosque where ''taleem'' (and, on Friday, ''jum'a'') is held each evenings after ''isha'', but also serves as the local headquarters and community center of '''Tablighi Jamaat''', a conservative Sunni tradition that emphasizes missionary work within the larger Muslim community."
"A Salafi mosque and community center located in a storefront in the heart of Genesee-Moselle, the Islamic Da'Wah Center of Buffalo hosts all prayers except formal ''jum'a'' for a multicultural congregation."
"Jami Masjid is located in the building that was for eighty years the home of '''Queen of Peace Catholic Church''', founded in 1920 to serve a small Polish enclave that had migrated northeastward from Broadway-Fillmore. The building dates to seven years after the congregation was established, a sandstone and limestone edifice in a pleasant English Gothic style whose design was unique among all the city's Catholic churches: church, school and rectory were combined in one large cross-shaped structure. Today the church portion is where Sheikh Ibrahim Memon leads one of Buffalo's largest Muslim congregations in Friday prayers, while the school portion of the building is now home to the '''Universal School''', which provides a private Islamic education in the Sunni tradition to elementary- and middle school-aged students."
"Masjid Darus-Salaam is located in Humboldt Park, in a converted house on a quiet side street next to next to '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' — look for the smallish sign hanging from the porch on the second floor. The building may look small at first, but it's got enough space for about 75 people for ''jum'a'' as well as an extensive library of Qu'ran translations, ''hadith'' collections, and other Islamic literature available for study. In addition to Friday services, Darus-Salaam also hosts a wide variety of other prayer meetings, religious education courses, and activities on a seven-day-a-week basis."
"Among the oldest mosques in Buffalo, Nu'Man is a primarily African-American congregation that meets in a space on the second floor of a brown-brick commercial building in the heart of Humboldt Park. Friday ''jum'a'' (in the Sunni tradition) is attended by a vibrant, loving congregation that's well-known for its engagement in community betterment in a myriad of different ways, while on Sunday mornings Islamic studies classes are offered for both children and adults."
"Like '''Jami Masjid''', this is another example of a former Christian church converted into a combination mosque and Muslim school: in 1993, the former '''Holy Mother of the Rosary Polish National Cathedral''' in Broadway-Fillmore became the home of '''Masjid Zakariya''' and its associated school, the '''Darul-Uloom Al-Madania Institute of Higher Islamic Education'''. At the former, ''jum'a'' and other services are held for a congregation composed of about a hundred families, mostly immigrants from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; in the latter, students from pre-kindergarten through grade 10 are educated in a combination of the standard New York State curriculum and rigorous study of the principles of the Sunni Islamic faith."
"Located in the Buffalo Police Department's former '''Eighth Precinct Headquarters''', Chùa Từ Hiếu has served the local Vietnamese Buddhist community since 1998, but it was not until 2014 — when the breathtaking outdoor courtyard and garden were put in place next door — when it truly came to the attention of the Broadway-Fillmore community. Decorated with a set of stone pillars imported from Vietnam and centered on a statue of Quan Âm, the ''bodhisattva'' of mercy to whom many refugees prayed for safe travel to their new homeland, this normally serene place periodically becomes the scene of cultural events and gatherings such as group meditation sessions and an annual Vietnamese New Year celebration featuring traditional music and dance. Otherwise, the temple is open for worship daily."
"Tu Viện Đại Bảo Trang Nghiêm sees the former '''St. Agnes Catholic Church''' in Lovejoy reborn as a complex that combines a thriving Buddhist monastery, worship space and cultural center with the head offices of the '''International Sangha Bhiksu Buddhist Association'''. The temple is open to the public daily for silent prayer and on Sundays and Mondays for group chanting and meditation, and also hosts Vietnamese language classes for children and various cultural events."
"Formerly Trade Centre Road, Sheikh Zayed Road is the largest and most famous street in Dubai. The expressway has evolved in recent years to the main traffic artery of the desert city and connects nearly all parts of modern Dubai. It runs parallel to the coast line from the roundabout at the World Trade Centre to the border with the emirate of Abu Dhabi in the area of Jebel Ali . The use of the road is partially toll. This road has six lanes at the widest point in each direction, plus parallel side roads. It is almost exclusively for the private motorized vhicles. For pedestrians there are a few bridges and underpasses to cross the street."
"The Emirates Towers complex contains the Emirates Office Tower and Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel. The two towers, which rise to 355 m (1,165 ft) and 309 m (1,014 ft), respectively, stand as the 23rd and 47th tallest buildings in the world. The two towers are connected by a 9,000 m² (96,875 ft²) two-storey retail complex known as ""The Boulevard"". The Emirates Towers complex is located on the Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and is a symbol of the city of Dubai. A curiosity of the design is that the towers have a similar number of floors; the taller office tower actually contains 54 floors, while the hotel tower contains 56 floors. This is because the individual floor heights of the office tower are greater than that of the hotel. The Emirates Towers complex is set in over 570,000 m² (42 acres) of gardens, with lakes, waterfalls and public seating areas. There is parking space for up to 1,800 cars."
"Hatta is a sheikhdom in the Hajjar mountains. It is an exclave of the Emirate of Dubai, UAE, to the south-east of its main territory. Its capital town, also named Hatta, includes a reconstructed heritage village by the same name. Hatta is about 115 km (71 mi) east of Dubai City. Because of its altitude, Hatta has a milder climate than the city of Dubai, making Hatta a popular vacation place for Dubai residents. The old village of Hatta includes two prominent military towers from the 18th century and the Juma mosque (built in 1780), the oldest building in Hatta, as well as about 30 loam houses. The reconstructed heritage village displays scenes from everyday life in the past. The traditional water supply (falaj system) has also been repaired. Hatta's status as an exclave of Dubai arose in the late 19th century, when the village of Hajarain or Hijrain in Wadi Hatta was given to Sheikh Rashid I Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai, by Turki bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman."
"A 30 metre long Dinosaur dwarf is situated just by the Hatta Mountains. Enter it's stomach through the stairs under its tail, which will lead you to a room where the replicas of the stone age are kept. On the top, a white prancing horse adorns a hill at the farm. Visitors are greeted by a cannon to the farm. Stony driveway, walkways and internal roads have pictures created from various stones and all of different colors."
"Mushrif Park is 5.25 square kilometre (1300 acre) desert-like park in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is located in the eastern part of the city (near the suburb of Khawaneej), about 16 km (10 mi) from the traditional center of Dubai. The park was created in early 1980 by Dubai Municipality and was hugely expanded and refurbished in 1989. The entrance fee to Mushrif Park is 10 dirhams per car."
"Miracle Garden is the most beautiful garden in the world with more than 45 million flowers. It is the world’s biggest natural flower. This colorful garden is well maintained and has numerous sculptures made out of flowers. A place full of flowers in the middle of desert."
"Annual festival (usually during winter). Countries around the world gather and set up a small village in the outskirts of Dubai. Each country/region has its own pavilion with a unique replica of their famous landmark(s). This is usually like a flea market where you can get souvenirs from almost every corner of the earth for a bargained price and experience as if you're in that certain country for at least 10 minutes of your life even if you're 10,000&nbsp;km away. Raffles for cars and gold bars also happen. You'd see the hieroglyphics of Egypt, temples of Thailand, Forbidden city of Beijing, the Eiffel tower and many more."
"This is 5 km world-class motorsports circuit hosted many international championships. You can take thrilling driving experience here in some of the world's fastest sports cars."

"This delightful cottage on Edward Street is where Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, lived from her birth in 1864 to her matriculation at '''Wells College''' about 1880. Frances' father Oscar Folsom, a prominent lawyer, died at a young age in a carriage accident, whereupon his friend and colleague, Grover Cleveland, took on the responsibility of caring for his widow and two daughters. Cleveland's relationship with Frances would blossom into a romance, culminating in their marriage in 1886, the first and still the only presidential wedding to ever take place at the White House. Folsom Cleveland was immensely popular — the public was struck by her beauty, poise and intelligence, and ladies of the day slavishly copied her fashion sense — and she's still the youngest First Lady in U.S. history. Though the house at 168 Edward Street is not open for tours, the city has placed an interpretive plaque in front of it with details on Folsom Cleveland's life, historical importance, and legacy. Architecture buffs will also take note of this fine example of the mid-19th Century red brick Italianates that remain popular on the Lower West Side."
"The brainchild of California real estate magnate David Karpeles, the Karpeles Manuscript Library is the world's largest privately-owned collection of historic documents and manuscripts. The library consists of twelve branches nationwide, including two in Buffalo: '''Porter Hall''', located in Prospect Hill at the beautifully restored former home of the '''Plymouth Methodist Church''', and '''North Hall''' in Allentown. In addition to the travelling exhibits that rotate among all twelve branches of the library, Porter Hall houses the permanent collection of the Buffalo branch of the Karpeles Manuscript Library, including the William McKinley Room where original documents concerning the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley at Buffalo's Pan-American Exposition are displayed."
"A pioneering institution in the now-burgeoning art scene in Grant-Amherst, Artsphere Studio opened in 2003, across the street from its current building. This bright, airy, and spacious gallery features the work of its owner Doreen Boyer DeBoth, a painter, photographer and jewelrymaker; her husband, noted potter Douglas DeBoth, whose works are available for sale at the gallery; and other local artists working in a diverse variety of media. As well, temporary exhibitions are frequently held whose themes are often related to the rich history and unique identity of Black Rock and Grant-Amherst: Boyer DeBoth is a founding member of the '''Black Rock Historical Society''' and spearheaded the '''Black Rock Historic Photo Project''' whose constituent works can be seen on the exterior walls of several Amherst Street buildings. As well, a modest selection of books on local history and art are available for sale."
"Opened in February 2014 in a temporary space with ""Blow"", a joint exhibition of paintings, photographs and sculpture by a quartet of local artists which had as its theme Buffalo's long, bleak winters, the Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery (BT&C for short) moved four months later into its permanent gallery on Niagara Street in the Upper West Side, a converted warehouse that's also home to '''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery''' and is across the street from the new headquarters of '''Sugar City'''. Under the careful direction of Anna Kaplan, whose pedigree in the local arts community has included stints as curatorial assistant at the '''Albright-Knox Art Gallery''' and on the faculty of '''Daemen College''''s fine arts department, the BT&C Gallery's focus is not only on hosting exhibitions of minimalist, abstract contemporary art in a diversity of media, but also — contrary to the majority of other Buffalo galleries whose promotional focus is strictly on the local market — to work actively in the marketing of local artists to galleries and collectors outside Western New York."
"Located at the former '''St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church''' in the heart of historic Black Rock, the mission of the Buffalo Religious Arts Center is to salvage and display some of the works of religious art contained in the many churches and other places of worship (particularly on the East Side) that have closed their doors in the wake of Buffalo's half-century of population loss. In addition to the priceless works from other churches that curator Mary Holland has collected, such as statuary from '''St. Mary of Sorrows''', icons from '''SS. Peter & Paul Russian Orthodox Church''', and various items from '''Temple Beth El''', St. Francis Xavier itself is a magnificent old building full of beautiful and uplifting art which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was a longtime cornerstone of the Black Rock community."
"A complex of four buildings that serve as living quarters as well as studio and exhibition space for painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, and all manner of other artists, the Essex Arts Center has been a mainstay on the West Side for four decades running. The center traces its history back to 1969, when local steel sculptor Larry Griffis and his Ashford Hollow Foundation, which was established three years previously to administer the 400-acre (160 ha) sculpture park he'd established in Cattaraugus County, purchased the former '''Webster-Citizens Company Ice House''' to use as an arts studio and performance venue. The Essex Arts Center immediately attracted to its roster a veritable Who's Who of Buffalo's arts scene of the 1970s and '80s, and over the years it has proven to be an incredibly prolific incubator of institutions that have gone on to become major players in the local arts scene — '''Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the '''CEPA Gallery''', and the dearly missed '''Artists' Committee Gallery''' all got their start at 30 Essex before striking out on their own, and '''Big Orbit Gallery''', founded in 1991 and described below, carries on the tradition at its original location. Besides the gallery, the Essex Arts Center also hosts frequent events such as art auctions, musical performances, and educational workshops and seminars whose proceeds go directly to benefit the local arts community."
"Established in 1991, Big Orbit Gallery is a collective run by and for artists, featuring a changing schedule of experimental exhibitions in a diversity of media. This expansive gallery — situated in a former warehouse whose high ceiling, adjacent interior courtyard, and minimalist decor lend it a cavernous, airy ambience — features diverse exhibitions of works by local artists. Everything from traditional media like painting and photography, to performance art and sound sculpture, to genre-defying, avant-garde spectacle of all kinds can be found here. These works are united by their transcendence of cultures and viewpoints: Big Orbit Gallery prides itself not only on bringing established artists from the Buffalo area to the national and international stage, but also on building awareness of emerging artists of underrepresented demographics. A word of warning: updates to their website are sporadic at best, so Facebook or the pages of ''Artvoice'' are probably better bets for those who want to see what's on at Big Orbit."
"This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill is part private residence, part archaeological dig and part art gallery: award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher bought it in 2009 when it was on the city's demolition list and has been living in and renovating it ever since, a process that has yielded a treasure trove of salvaged structural and decorative elements that he assembles — along with found items from thrift stores, flea markets, and other sources — into imaginative collages displayed in the gallery space on the house's first floor. This ongoing project has earned him praise from the '''New York Foundation for the Arts''' and in the pages of the ''New York Times'', among others. Aside from Maher's own work, the Fargo House also occasionally hosts exhibitions by other artists from the local area."
"Sugar City is the loose arts collective that's been best known recently for their impromptu ""guerrilla""-style art shows and performances that have popped up at various spots around town over the two-year interval between their departure from their former home on Wadsworth Street in Allentown and the grand opening of their new one in the Upper West Side. True to their usual nature, most of the renovation work at the new facility was performed by the seven ""Sugar Citizens"" themselves, but it wouldn't be exactly accurate to pin the ""DIY"" label on the collective: its community-based, participatory approach to art would be better described as ""do it together"". The exhibit space in Sugar City's front room is given over to those artists who cannot obtain space in more traditional galleries, with an aim of blurring the lines and redefining what is and is not considered art. There's probably no way to describe the exhibits you'll find here, other than to say these are the misfits of Buffalo's art scene whose creative output defies categorization, so expect the unexpected."
"The humble '''West Side Value Laundromat''' on Massachusetts Avenue is hardly the place you'd expect to be a reliable clearinghouse for information on community cultural happenings, let alone the venue for art studio space, a small library, and a wide gamut of artistic and cultural events. Yet that's exactly what the WASH Project (the acronym stands for ""Westside Art Strategy Happenings"") consists of. Owner Zaw Win, one of the West Side's growing legion of Burmese refugees who boasts a long history of political activism in his home country, teamed up in 2012 with local activist Barrett Gordon and financial benefactors including '''Houghton College''' and the local chapter of '''AmeriCorps''' to turn his laundromat into a beehive of community cultural life where the accent, not surprisingly, is on the diverse patchwork of ethnic groups that have forged a cohesive community on the West Side. At the WASH Project's small gallery, you can peruse monthly changing exhibitions of work by local artists, attend classes and workshops on a wide range of artistic subjects, create your own masterpiece in the ""Creative Spin"" studio (chalk art on the sidewalk outside the building is popular during the warmer months) — and maybe throw in a load of laundry while you're at it. '''''NOTE: The WASH Project has temporarily moved to a new location in Grant-Ferry, where it will remain until fall 2018 while renovations on their original Massachusetts Avenue location are ongoing. Laundry facilities are available across the street at The Laundry Spot. The address and directions given in this listing are for the temporary location.'''''"
"Community Beer Works offers free, informal tours of its facilities whenever their retail store is open. Outside of retail hours, private tours for between 10 and 35 people are available by appointment, subject to the company's ability to staff them."
"With a moniker that pays tribute to the newfound ambition and vigor in Buffalo (and particularly on the emerging stretch of Niagara Street where the brewery is located), the Resurgence Brewery opened in June 2014 in the wake of $1 million in renovations to the former '''Sterling Engine Company''' warehouse that's also home to the offices of '''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''' and the '''BT&C Gallery'''. Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins are Buffalo natives who've put to work their extensive experience in the brewing industry and research of beer culture across North America in the manufacture of premium-quality craft beers in their own hometown. The company's goal for their first year is to produce 3,000 barrels of over a hundred different brews, ranging from standards such as Belgian tripel, saison and India pale ale to locally-themed flavors such as ""Loganberry Wit"" and ""Sponge Candy Stout"". Also in the pipeline is a pilot brewing program, where beer buffs can dream up their own recipes, have a few small batches brewed and sampled by customers, with the potential for those that prove most popular to earn a permanent slot on the menu."
"Broderick Park is a small waterfront green space located at the southern tip of Unity Island. This spot is historically important as one of Western New York's major crossing points into Canada for fugitive slaves travelling the Underground Railroad, as attested to by a prominent historical marker and the occasional historical reenactments that take place there. This was also the site from which the ferry service to Fort Erie, Ontario set off in the days before the '''Peace Bridge'''. Today, Broderick Park is a popular fishing spot where perch, yellow and northern pike, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, and other species native to the Niagara River are reeled in, and is also a haven for picnickers, sunbathers, and bicyclists who pass through the park along the '''Shoreline Trail'''. Amenities include a picnic shelter, as well as a newly constructed amphitheater, gardens, and interpretive exhibits. Broderick Park is also the northern terminus of the '''Bird Island Pier''' (see below)."
"One of Buffalo's many Olmsted parks, Front Park (or ""The Front"", as it was originally named) is situated along '''Porter Avenue''' just south of the '''Peace Bridge''' and contains a soccer field, tennis courts, and picnic facilities, as well as original features such as ""The Hippodrome"", a 3.5-acre (1.5 ha) lawn intended for picnicking or informal team sports, and a terrace concourse for carriages adorned with a handsome statue of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Intended to both showcase and enhance the beauty of the Niagara River and Lake Erie and emphasize its significance to the history and identity of Buffalo, the park once also boasted extensive formal gardens. At the north end of the park stood '''Fort Porter''', built in the mid-1840s as a customshouse and military installation. Some time later, Olmsted was given the green light to extend the Front beyond the canal to the edge of the river itself; though it never materialized, this extension would have included playgrounds, a beach, and a boardwalk. Sadly, together with the West Side's other Olmsted park, '''Riverside Park''', Front Park was badly damaged by the urban renewal that decimated the West Side in the middle 20th Century: the construction of Interstate 190 over the former canal bed robbed the concourse of its serene lake views, and the construction of the new plaza for the Peace Bridge in 1951 culled seven acres (2.5ha) from the size of the park, resulted in the demolition of Fort Porter, and routed noisy trucks bound for Canada through the park (the latter problem will be solved by the controversial expansion of the Peace Bridge plaza slated for the next few years, after which trucks will access the bridge from a new entrance away from the park)."
"Though not an Olmsted park, LaSalle Park is the largest park along Buffalo's waterfront, and its plethora of amenities — baseball diamonds, soccer fields, a swimming pool, a skate park, and a dog run (""The Barkyard"") — have made it popular among locals. This 89-acre (36 ha) expanse was named Centennial Park when it opened to visitors in 1932, Buffalo's 100th year as a city. Later, of course, its name was changed to honor the French explorer René-Robert Cavalier de La Salle, whose ship ''Le Griffon'' passed along the Lake Erie shore in 1679, the first European to see the land now called Buffalo. Architecture buffs will enjoy the Buffalo Water Authority's historic '''Colonel Francis G. Ward Pumping Station''', built between 1909 and 1915 to a design by the local firm of Esenwein & Johnson in a style that's an eclectic hybrid of Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism and the Romanesque Revival."
"Situated on 39 acres (16 ha) in the far northwest corner of the city, Riverside Park features facilities for every outdoor activity imaginable: baseball diamonds, football and soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts, a swimming pool, a playground, and the '''Ruben ""Bud"" Bakewell Ice Rink'''. Riverside Park was the last addition to Buffalo's Olmsted park system — it was not conceived and built until after Frederick Law Olmsted's death, commissioned by the city in 1898 and designed by his two sons. Riverside Park was intended to finally fulfill the elder Olmsted's dream of a true waterfront park for the city and included all the classic Olmsted elements — a meadow, footpaths, wooded thickets, and a carriage concourse — as well as pleasant minnow pools along its northern boundary. It was to have been connected to the rest of the park system by '''Roesch Avenue''', a parkway leading north and west from Delaware Park which was never built. Sadly, Riverside Park is probably the least well-preserved of Buffalo's Olmsted parks today, owing to the construction of Interstate 190 along the canal bed and the removal of many of the historic Olmsted features. However, the scenic overlook still provides a stunning view over the Niagara River (with direct access to the shore provided by the '''Irene K. Gardner Pedestrian Bridge''' over the expressway), and the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy recently unveiled '''River Rock Gardens''' on the former site of the minnow pools, now reinterpreted as a large chain of stone-bedded rain gardens peppered with greenery, traversed by footpaths, and centered on an elegant stone arch bridge."
"The Bird Island Pier dates from 1822, when it was built as a buffer between the Erie Canal and the rough waters of the Niagara River, and was once a lively place of fishing shacks, canal boats, and pleasure steamers bound for Canada and Grand Island. Though those are long-gone, the pier recently completed an extensive renovation and structural stabilization and, for the first time in three years, is now completely reopened as a scenic pedestrian walkway. Proceeding southward from '''Broderick Park''' past the '''Peace Bridge''' and onward to a point parallel to '''LaSalle Park''' — 1.3 miles (2 km) in all — walkers can experience an unparalleled view of the Niagara River and Fort Erie to their right, then turn their head and watch rowing crews from Canisius, St. Joe's, and other area high schools set off along the canal from the '''West Side Rowing Club'''. At the end, you're treated to a waterfront panorama that is simply without equal, with the '''Erie Basin Marina''' in the foreground and the downtown skyline and grain elevators off in the distance."
"Founded in 1992 by West Side residents, the Massachusetts Avenue Project's vision encompasses access to affordable and nutritious food for all, the transformation of blighted urban areas into productive green space, community education, and economic betterment on a grassroots level. Its centerpiece is the '''Growing Green Urban Farm''', the first one in Buffalo, located on thirteen vacant lots totalling more than an acre (4,000 square meters) in area. Produce is grown in a large greenhouse as well as expansive garden beds, and the farm also features a small orchard of fruit trees, free-range chickens, and a fish hatchery — all kept green by a state-of-the-art, rainwater-fed aquaponics system installed in 2009. Farm work is performed by local youths recruited through the '''Mayor's Summer Youth Program''', educating them with information about healthy food as well as valuable work skills. There's also a farm stand onsite where the fruits of the land are sold."
"The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse has perhaps the most unusual history of any of Buffalo's Wright buildings. Designed in 1905 (contemporaneously with Wright's most famous Buffalo commissions, the lost '''Larkin Administration Building''' and the very-much-alive '''Darwin D. Martin House'''), it was intended to be built for the University of Wisconsin Boat Club in Madison, but was instead built in Buffalo — in 2007, over a century after Wright's design was finalized — and only thanks to the dogged efforts of a local group of Wright aficionados financed largely by Buffalo-born screenwriter Tom Fontana. The only alteration to the original design was the replacement of the stucco on the exterior walls with concrete. The Fontana Boathouse does double duty today as both the working boathouse of the '''West Side Rowing Club''' and a destination for the growing legion of architectural tourists who come to Buffalo to see the works of Wright and other greats. It's also available to rent for private events."
"Held annually in early April, the Buffalo Small Press Book Fair sees authors, artists, poets, booksellers, bookmakers, and book enthusiasts descend on Karpeles Manuscript Library's '''Porter Hall''' to break bread, exchange ideas, and interact with fans and aspiring authors. Books, zines, artwork, and other materials can be bought and sold, and lectures, symposia, poetry readings, and other cultural performances are also put on. Attendance is free of charge and open to the public."
"Every year since 1997 on the third Saturday in June, the Discover Amherst Street Festival has shined a limelight on the newly revitalized neighborhood of Grant-Amherst. A huge variety of activities, events and sales are put on by neighborhood businesses all day, culminating with a parade that begins at noon at the festival's ground zero, the historic Flemish Renaissance-style '''Ladder #12 Firehouse'''. Worthy of special mention is the '''464 Gallery''', whose daylong art fair and sale is a key feature of the festival every year, as well as the annual weiner-eating contest at '''Spar's European Sausages'''. Trolley rides and horse-drawn buggies traverse Amherst Street all afternoon, and live music is performed at various places around the neighborhood."
"The Taste of Diversity has been held on Grant Street every summer since 2003 on varying dates, and has become the most popular street festival on the West Side, with almost 2,000 attendees gathering on the block between Lafayette and Auburn Avenues in the heart of the strip. As might be inferred from its title, what's celebrated at the Taste of Diversity are the delicious and vibrant cuisines of each of the West Side's vibrant ethnic communities. But don't mistake this for a clone of downtown's '''Taste of Buffalo''': rather than the area's hoity-toitiest restaurants duking it out for prize money and publicity, the Taste of Diversity takes a decidedly more grassroots approach, where the food is prepared by smaller, more humble (but, it should be emphasized, equally delicious and arguably more authentic) neighborhood restaurants and food trucks, and where the goal is to celebrate the beauty of West Side's diversity — and perhaps more importantly, the fact that a united, cohesive community with an increasingly high quality of life has been forged out of these disparate elements. Festivities at the Taste of Diversity also comprise traditional music, dancing, and other events representing the full spectrum of the West Side's cultural rainbow."
"Shared between Buffalo and neighboring Fort Erie, Ontario, the Friendship Festival is a weeklong celebration of almost 200 years of friendship and mutual cooperation between the United States and Canada, and coincides with both Independence Day in the United States (July 4th) and Canada Day (July 1st). Beginning in late June, festivities are held on both sides of the Niagara River, notably Riverside Park in Buffalo and Mather Arch Park in Fort Erie. On both sides of the border, parades, classic car shows, War of 1812 reenactments (at Old Fort Erie), live music, and fireworks are enjoyed."
"Buffalo has a vibrant multiethnic heritage dating back almost to the time the city was founded, and almost inarguably the most dominant culture was the Germans: in the late 19th Century, they made up more than half of the city's population, and even today, fully 14% of Western New Yorkers claim German ancestry. Why, then, does Buffalo not have a huge German festival to match its '''Italian Festival''', '''St. Patrick's Day Parade''', '''Dyngus Day''', ad nauseam? That was the question posed by the inimitable ""Airborne"" Eddy Dobosiewicz, founder of the festival which was celebrated for the first time in 2013 and aims to take a place alongside those other annual Buffalo traditions. Scaled down quite a bit from the massive, multi-venue blowouts of years past, beginning in 2016 it's the {{marker|type=listing|name=Polish Cadets|lat=42.937838|long=-78.889268}} hall on Grant Street, ironically enough, that plays host to River Rocktoberfest. Live oompah music, authentic German food and beer, and Teutonic merrymaking of all kinds await you in late September."
"'''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''', the community organization whose mission is to contribute to Buffalo's revitalization through the remediation of local waterways, holds a series of educational kayak tours in Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and points between. The lineup of tours changes from year to year, but as an example, on the West Side the 2014 schedule included the annual '''Scajaquada Creek Regatta''', a ""leisurely paddle down the Black Rock Canal and up historic Scajaquada Creek, an underutilized resource full of history and ecology"" that launched at the {{marker|type=listing|name=Great Lakes Center|lat=42.899095|long=-78.901841}} off Porter Avenue. Participants can bring their own kayak or reserve one of Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper's limited supply."
"Offering customized cruises for up to 6 people on the ''Summerlove'', a 1956-model Chris Craft express cruiser with ample room on the deck for sightseeing, sunbathing or just taking in the surroundings, ""Captain Rich"" and ""First Mate Pat"" will take you anywhere you want to go on the upper Niagara River — whether it be a trip through the historic Black Rock lock, a cruise down to Canalside, a visit to the Erie Canal or Beaver Island State Park, a full circle around Grand Island, or whatever suits your fancy. A relaxing day on the water is in store for customers: as the website put it, ""the way she cuts through the water, the smell of varnish, the sight of glistening mahogany wood and the rumble of a vintage motor all lend themselves to an unforgettable experience."" In case of inclement weather, you can reschedule your cruise at no charge (subject to availability) or else receive a full refund."
"The ''Grand Lady'' is an 80-foot cruise ship based at Black Rock's '''Rich Marina''' that's been offering scheduled cruises and private charters on the upper Niagara River since 1998. Passengers on the ''Grand Lady'' have their choice of itineraries: two-hour lunch cruises take in the Black Rock, Riverside, and Tonawanda waterfronts as far as the '''South Grand Island Bridge''', with live sightseeing narration by the captain and your choice of chicken française or roast beef roulade, and three-hour dinner cruises proceed as far as the entrance to the Erie Canal in North Tonawanda (or, on their once-monthly four-hour cruises, circumnavigate Grand Island) and boast live entertainment, a cash bar, and an elegant three-course meal of a tossed salad, a ""Chef's Choice"" double entrée of char-grilled sirloin filet and stuffed chicken breast, and homemade cheesecake. For vegetarians, an alternative main course of roasted vegetables and orzo pasta is available on request. The schedule is variable, but in general it features one to two of both types of cruise weekly; it's recommended you reserve as early as possible. The ''Grand Lady'' sails rain or shine."
"Described in the ''UB Spectrum'' as an ""unpretentious diamond in the rough"", the American Repertory Theatre moved to its current location in Grant-Amherst in 2015 from its former home in the Delaware District with the help of Dwane Hall, the owner of the '''Sportsmen's Tavern''' next door, creating in the process a grassroots-based performing arts alliance that's bolstered the already sizzling Amherst Street cultural scene. The ART's new home is an intimate ""black box""-style playhouse with fifty seats and a production schedule that regularly includes not only a mix of classic and contemporary theatrical works, but also live music, film screenings, poetry readings, and a variety of community events."
"The Kavinoky Theatre is located in Prospect Hill on the campus of '''D'Youville College'''. Over the course of its history, not only has the Kavinoky Theatre thoroughly restored the historic former '''Porter-View Room''' under the auspices of the D'Youville Capital Campaign, but this local repertory company of professional actors has produced nearly 150 plays and musicals of a consistently high quality, earning them more awards than any other troupe in Buffalo. The Kavinoky Theatre has given many actors of local extraction their start in the business."
"Buffalo's premier alternative theatre, the New Phoenix Theatre on the Park opened in 1996 in a historic house in the West Village and has quickly gained an impressive reputation for the high-quality, diverse range of performances it has hosted in its tiny space, trending heavily towards bold contemporary works of theatre as well as avant-garde reinterpretations of old favorites. The New Phoenix Theatre on the Park hopes to foster a spirit of community collaboration not only through its exciting theatrical offerings, but also by playing an active role in the ongoing revitalization of the West Village neighborhood."
"Grant-Ferry's live performance venue of choice. From indie rock bands and acoustic troubadours, to DJs spinning cutting-edge electronica, to big-band jazz, to such exotica as drum circles, belly-dancing and poetry slams, there's really no rhyme or reason to the array of local acts that take the stage at the Gypsy Parlor. Open-mic night is held every Tuesday at 8PM."
"Designed by the internationally-famous father-and-son team of Eliel and Eero Saarinen, Kleinhans Music Hall is among the most architecturally distinguished buildings in Buffalo (it has served as a model for Festival Hall in London, among other venues), and boasts world-renowned acoustics. Aside from the several-times-weekly performances of the Buffalo Philharmonic itself, Kleinhans also features performances by other orchestras, small theatrical shows, and popular music acts — which have included Natalie Merchant, Johnny Mathis, and the Indigo Girls — performing either on their own or backed by the Philharmonic as part of the '''BPO Rocks!''' concert series."
"On the first Saturday of each month, this hip yet unpretentious neighborhood watering hole at the heart of Grant-Amherst is transformed into the site of the '''Black Rock Fiddle Jam''', where local musicians get together for a rousing round of old-time acoustic music — an informal, freeform hoedown of fiddles, mandolins, banjos, guitars and good times. For those who would rather try their hand at playing instead of just watching and listening, lessons for all skill levels are provided free of charge."
"It was scarcely possible to be a rock fan in Buffalo in the '90s and early '00s without having an intimate familiarity with the old Showplace — it was a linchpin of the local scene, with a list as long as your arm of punk, alternative and indie bands that graced the stage of this former movie theater just before they reached superstar status (including, off the top of this author's head: Pearl Jam, the Goo Goo Dolls, Finger Eleven, and the Tragically Hip). The Showplace finally shut its doors in 2007, but after a six-year hiatus, local entrepreneur Joe Roxbury bought the building, renovated it from top to bottom, and reopened it in 2016 with a full slate of concerts, comedy shows, and the like in the offing."
"Though there are very few sportsmen to be found here, the Sportsmen's Tavern has emerged over the past few years as a real standout: with an authentically gritty roadhouse vibe, the self-described ""honkiest, tonkiest beer joint in town"" is among Buffalo's premier places to see live local country, folk, blues, and roots-rock acts. Sportsmen's is a venue by musicians and for musicians — its owner is a longtime stalwart in the Buffalo scene, and many local artists and bands cite it as their favorite place to play in the city. The 325 seats are regularly filled with an eclectic mix of hipsters, college students, and neighborhood regulars who probably remember the days when the place was just a garden-variety neighborhood gin mill. And the '''Grille at Sportsmen's Tavern''' goes above and beyond the usual pub grub, serving probably the best food of any live-music venue in the city. For a truly unique experience, try to get seats in the upstairs balcony."
"Sugar City is back: after ballooning rents priced the venerable DIY arts collective out of their former headquarters in Allentown (now the home of '''PAUSA Art House'''), they reemerged in August 2014 in a new spot on what the ''Buffalo News'' has termed the ""suddenly sexy 1200 block of Niagara Street"", which is also home to the '''Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. The performance space in the rear of Sugar City seats audiences of up to 170 — quite a bit bigger than the stage at their old digs — and plays host to a variety of local bands that run the indie gamut from hardcore punk to ambient noise to neo-garage rock. Theatrical productions, poetry readings, and other performances take place as well. As before, all shows at Sugar City are all ages and alcohol-free."
"This neighborhood laundromat-cum-cultural nucleus boasts '''WASH the Mic!''', a bimonthly open-mic event where local musicians come to jam, as well as a monthly curated concert series that's a showcase for the local ambient, drone, and experimental noise scenes."
"Ground zero for the Upper West Side's retail scene, the West Side Bazaar is one of the main ''raisons d'être'' of the emergence of Buffalo's new internationally-flavored commercial district. It has served not only as a business incubator helping newly landed immigrants on their feet and on their way to successful entrepreneurship, but also as an important gathering place for new residents eager for a friendly reminder of their native lands. A project of the '''Westminster Economic Development Initiative''', the West Side Bazaar was founded in 2009 and two years later expanded into a full-fledged market, inspired by the '''Malcolm Shabazz Market''' in Harlem and in keeping with the tradition of large public markets like the East Side's '''Broadway Market''' which could at one time be found all over Buffalo. The West Side Bazaar moved to a larger location in April 2013, and today contains a large and growing lineup of stalls selling a maddeningly diverse array of ethnic fashions and crafts, as well as an '''International Kitchen''' with immigrant-owned restaurants serving authentic international cuisines (see below)."
"At one of the West Side Bazaar's newest stalls, shopkeeper Maung Moe serves Buffalo's Karen immigrant community with an impressive selection of clothing spanning both traditional and Western styles. A wide range of winter gear is also offered, along with more modest selections of other accessories, jewelry, shoes, and cosmetics."
"Owner Gysma Kueny moved to Buffalo in 2002 from war-torn South Sudan, and now operates her eponymous shop at the West Side Bazaar where a wide range of ethnic clothing, cultural gifts, and specialty bath products are for sale. Available here are fashion accessories such as artisan jewelry, handbags, a modest range of clothing, and even scarves and gloves, along with shea butter and various natural soaps including black soap imported from Ghana. Craft items are handmade by African artisans and include baskets, works of art, and (especially) wooden figurines representing giraffes, tigers, elephants, lions, water buffalo, and other African fauna. Best of all, the money you spend here could scarcely go to a better cause: Kueny uses part of her profits to fund a charitable initiative to promote education for South Sudanese girls."
"Julienne Nyiranjishi's whole family are artisans — both those in Buffalo and back home in Rwanda — and it's their work that's for sale at Julienne's Boutique. Clothing, jewelry and accessories, traditional baskets, and postcards bedecked with beautiful African imagery are on offer, but the specialty here is handmade wooden carvings: from traditional bowls to statuettes to tableware."
"One of the West Side Bazaar's newest vendors, Myanmar native Khatiza Bodialam opened up shop in January 2014 at the stall formerly belonging to the sadly missed '''Anokha Leewu'''. Injecting still more color into an already vibrant environment, the cornerstone of Khatiza Gift Shop's inventory is traditional Burmese dresses in bright, cheery patterns, as well as handmade silk flowers in a multiplicity of varieties. Additionally, scarves, jewelry and other accessories are on offer, as well as a modest selection of fragrances."
"Nadeen Yousef, the owner and namesake of this little West Side Bazaar stall, is a native of Iraq who spent six years as a refugee in Syria before the onset of civil war there drove her to Buffalo in 2009. Macramé is rather popular in the Levant; less so in the United States, and back home Yousef had already begun making a name for herself with her skill in the craft, so it was only natural that she would turn to it as a way to make her living in her adopted country. At Macramé by Nadeen she offers a small but charming (and growing!) range of handmade macramé goods including wall art, jewelry, and plant hangers, as well as custom goods made to order."
"The rear wall of the West Side Bazaar is given over to Ma Theint's sprawling collection of ethnic clothing, home decor, and (above all) artworks and Burmese handicrafts. Customers can peruse traditional tapestries, Buddhist religious items, drums and musical instruments, tapestries, lacquerware, dolls and puppets, and scads of other items that serve Theint's mission of promoting appreciation of Burmese culture and the immigrant community in Buffalo."
"As advertised, the wares in Madhavi Pyakurel's new West Side Bazaar stall comprise traditional Nepali clothing, accessories, and cosmetics. ""Fashion has no boundaries"", says the store's motto, and it rings true — customers of all stripes come here to browse through or purchase at reasonable prices an ample gamut of truly elegant dresses and saris, lovely bead jewelry, comfy shoes, makeup and bath products."
"The African Market opened at the north end of Grant-Ferry in 2009; despite its name, the variety of imported foods offered here spans not only Africa, but the whole world. Though canned goods, spices, rice and other staples, and other miscellaneous groceries are sole here, the marquee item at the African Market is a wide variety of meats, many of which are halal or kosher — from everyday selections like beef and chicken to more unusual ones such as goat. A small selection of kitchenwares and ethnic clothing rounds out the stock. Best of all, unlike most small Grant Street businesses, the African Market boasts off-street parking: there's a small lot on the left side of the building, which is also where the main entrance is found."
"After a hot minute brweing up their homemade goodness in the basement of '''Horsefeathers Market''', Buffalo's first craft kombucha brewery moved on up in August 2016 to a bigger location on burgeoning Niagara Street, right next door to '''Resurgence Brewery'''. Kombucha is a lightly carbonated, fermented tea (Bootleg Bucha uses a mix of green and black teas) native to East Asia that has a wide array of purported health benefits; the super friendly and enthusiastic owners — Jeff Empric, Heather Lucas, and Todd Salansky, a trio of longtime friends who got their start homebrewing in their apartment and giving it away to family and friends — will be more than happy to run those down with you, or answer any other questions you may have. With the larger location has come a hugely expanded range of selections on offer — there are about four dozen different kombuchas now in the rotation of what's on tap at the store, including the ginger beer, carrot pineapple, and blueberry lavender that were so popular at the old Horsefeathers location. You can buy them in disposable plastic bottles if you like, but Bootleg Bucha will also sell you a more environmentally friendly reusable glass bottle for $2, or you can even bring your own growler to fill."
"Since 2012, this farm has been run on ten vacant lots on the Upper West Side by Matt Kauffman, as a ministry program of the nearby '''Buffalo Vineyard Church'''. The mission here is to promote sustainable gardening as a way of providing neighborhood residents not only with fresh produce, but also vital education regarding healthy dietary choices. The food grown at 5 Loaves is disseminated mostly to local residents who've signed up for food shares through the '''Community-Supported Agriculture''' program, as well as to local restaurants, schools and food banks — but seasonal produce is also available at their farm stand at the corner of West Delavan and West Avenues, open on Saturdays in season."
"Like the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', this longstanding butcher shop (opened in 1963 by the now-retired Frank and Maria Zarcone) is a throwback to the West Side's former identity as Buffalo's Italian neighborhood. Though many of the similar businesses that lined the area's streets have fallen by the wayside in the ensuing years, Zarcone's stuck around long enough to benefit from Grant-Ferry's revival as Buffalo's newest hip shopping district, with more and more new customers every day enjoying the fine quality meats available here at decent prices. The specialty at Zarcone's is homemade Italian sausage and meatballs — among the best in the city — but other meats (Italian and otherwise) are available here too, such as Delmonico steaks, stuffed pork chops, and a few seafood items. Limited off-street parking is available."
"Golden Burma serves the growing community of immigrants and refugees from that country that have settled on Buffalo's West Side with a wide range of Burmese groceries, including fresh seafood, meat and vegetables, as well as canned, packaged, and frozen foods. For fans of Southeast Asian cuisine, the perpetually crowded aisles of Golden Burma are an excellent place to find exotic and unusual products and ingredients that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo. Pots, pans, woks, and miscellaneous kitchenware are also on offer."
"With over 50 years of tradition, Guercio & Sons dates back to 1961. That's when Vincent and Nancy Guercio, immigrants to Buffalo from Cefalù, Sicily, purchased the erstwhile '''Grant Street Market''' and set out converting it into a gargantuan grocery store stocking all manner of meats, cheeses, produce, oils, and other foodstuffs imported from Italy. The business persevered through the demographic changes on the Upper West Side — which saw successive waves of immigrants from wholly different parts of the world pass through the neighborhood — and the rise of the suburban supermarket by expanding into wholesaling, furnishing ingredients for such well-known Buffalo restaurants as '''Left Bank''', '''Hutch's''', and the '''Buffalo Chophouse'''. Now owned by the five Guercio sons, the business is once again thriving — Guercio's is one of Buffalo's prime destinations for Italian foods, both imports and locally produced items such as sliced bread from '''Luigi's Bakery''' and '''Anchor Bar''' brand wing sauce. When they're done marveling at the lovely carts on the sidewalk brimming with delicious, brightly colored fruits, vegetables, and herbs, visitors to Guercio's can enter the building itself and stroll through the fragrant corridors stocked with everything you could ever want from an Italian grocery store — canned goods, imported pasta, sliced-to-order deli meats like mortadella and soppressata, a dizzying array of fine olive oils, and more. Quite simply, this place is not to be missed."
"Mirroring the neighborhood in which it's located, diversity is the name of the game at this friendly food market. Hatimy Market's helpful staff, helmed by Somali-born UB nursing student Ali Mohamed, serves nearly all of the West Side's varied communities of immigrants with a maddeningly eclectic variety of groceries from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Arab world. Meats from beef and chicken to lamb and goat, many of them certified halal, are joined on the shelves by seafood, canned goods, rice, spices, and various and sundry food items. Hatimy Market's owners also run '''Shawarma King''', a takeout window a few blocks south where delicious and inexpensive Middle Eastern and African foods are available."
"Founded in 2010 under the name '''Marka Halal Market''', this is yet another West Side destination for imported African and Arabian food. A variety of general groceries are stocked, but Jomow International Market's true claim to fame is its wide selection of halal meats, from beef and fish to goat and camel."
"Founded in 2014, the name of the game at this ethnic grocery at the north end of the Grant-Ferry strip is African and Middle Eastern specialty foods: from staples like rice and ''fufu'' flour, to frozen foods, to a wide selection of fresh produce, meats and fish. A range of toiletry products and other daily essentials are also on offer."
"Opened in 2010, Lin Asian Market is a pioneer when it comes to serving the culinary needs of the West Side's burgeoning community of Burmese immigrants and refugees. This place's small size and spartan interior belie an impressive variety of Burmese and other Southeast Asian grocery items."
"The cheeky puns are seemingly neverending: Lorigo's ""Meating Place"", so the slogan goes, is ""Your Link to Quality"". Indeed, homemade, family-recipe Italian sausage and meatballs are the specialty at the meat market that Joseph Lorigo founded on the East Side and moved to Grant Street in 1986. Lorigo's began life as a real, old-fashioned butcher shop of the type that are becoming less and less common these days, and the skilled professionals behind the counter still pride themselves in cutting the chicken, pork, veal, and other meats sold here to customers' specifications. However, as time went on, Lorigo's expanded into wholesaling and also converted the store itself into a grocery market that, in a nod to the current melting-pot identity of the neighborhood, sells a wide variety of ethnic foods from Latino (including a full line of Goya products) to Caribbean to Somali to Southeast Asian. The aisles are jumbled and hard to navigate and the place gets crowded at peak hours, but there are some really high-quality products to be found here. Check out their great selection of delicious and reasonably-priced frozen desserts, too."
"At first blush, you'd be forgiven for being a bit confused by the Produce Market. ""Meats, vegetables and groceries"" are advertised proudly on the sign at the front of this Nepali-owned food market, but there's no meat, and the selection of produce is quite underwhelming especially given the name of the place. To be fair, though, the two or three forlorn-looking boxes of veggies just inside the door don't constitute their entire produce section — the real good stuff is in back, with lots of garlic, citrus fruits, and various and sundry Asian produce to choose from. But it's the final element of the trio on the sign where Produce Market really shines. The bulk of their inventory is given over to a respectable variety of South and Southeast Asian packaged groceries and canned goods: huge sacks of rice are stacked in the front windows for passersby to admire, boxes of ''chana dal'' and other dried beans and legumes line the aisles, and spices are sold in bulk for shockingly low prices. A range of cooking oil, Indian pickles and chutneys, and frozen foods round out the selection here. Produce Market is open daily and keeps long hours, and the friendly staff is eager to help folks find what they need."
"Located across the street from corporate headquarters on Niagara Street, Rich's Red Brick Market is exactly what the name advertises — a charming 19th-century brick storefront that is the retail outlet for the gargantuan '''Rich Products Corporation'''. The Red Brick Market is one of the only places in the world where Rich's products, which are normally distributed wholesale to restaurants and other institutions, are offered for sale to the public directly — and at sharply discounted prices to boot. The ""café"" portion of this place's name, meanwhile, is indeed a misnomer; the place has only a small retail counter and one table, with much of the interior space given over to massive rows of freezers and coolers. Baked goods are prominent among the offerings in those coolers, with ready-to-bake bread, cookie and pastry dough on offer, as well as a full range of pasta products, meat and seafood items including delicious barbeque pork, and, of course, the famous '''Coffee Rich''' non-dairy creamer that put Rich Products on the map in the first place. Onsite as well is '''Dessert Builders''', which fills custom dessert orders on an advance-notice basis. The Red Brick Market also holds frequent ""Truck Load Sales"" where goods are sold in bulk for discounts even steeper than normal. Visitors who are daunted by the heavy, fast-moving traffic on Niagara Street will be glad to know that ample off-street parking is provided."
"Buffalo's population includes over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan, but for a long time, there was no place in the city for them to buy the foods they had enjoyed in their native lands. That all changed with the opening of Sagarmatha Grocery, whose owner Kaji Sunwar is a Nepalese expat who, with a little help from Buffalo's '''Rich Products Corporation''' and Canisius College's '''Students In Free Enterprise''', cut the ribbon to this friendly little shop in 2012. Here can be found a full range of fresh produce, canned and packaged goods, and spices to serve the palettes of Buffalo's Nepalese and Bhutanese immigrant communities, as well as other aficionados of those cuisines. As well, fresh goat, chicken, fish and beef are sold Wed-Sun, and a small selection of brightly-colored ethnic clothing items is also stocked. Sagarmatha doesn't neglect the rest of the multicultural West Side tapestry, either, stocking groceries and sundry items of interest to the Burmese, African, and Latino contingents as well, including an impressive range of Goya products for the latter."
"Another location of the same operation that runs '''United Grocery and Halal Meats''' on the Lower West Side, this place bills itself as a specialty food shop selling ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, Somalian, African, Spanish, and American food and spices"". That's a bit of an exaggeration, though — the offerings at United Super Bazaar consist of a selection of ethnic packaged foods (largely from South and East Asia) that's really nothing special by Grant Street standards, as well as standard simple American groceries you'd find at any corner bodega and non-edible daily needs such as toothpaste, over-the-counter drugs, and even toys, bedding, clothes and gifts. One strong point this place does boast is a large frozen food section containing some interesting exotic goodies."
"Opened in 2012 at the corner of Hampshire and West Ferry Streets, City Swagg offers the best in urban fashions straight from the streets of New York, L.A. and Miami. From everyday wear like jeans, dresses, and jackets, to shoes and accessories, to swimwear and body suits, the designs here are sexy, sassy and make a bold statement. As well as clothing, City Swagg also sells mobile phones and related accessories, with calling plans from providers such as H2O Wireless, T-Mobile, and Net10."
"High-fashion clothing with an urban flair is the stock in trade of Empire Kicks. An authorized retailer of Nike, Akoo, Timberland, Polo, Rocawear, and Reebok, this large store is located in a small plaza just off Grant Street. Empire Kicks is the place to go on the West Side for a wide range of authentic designer t-shirts, hoodies, jeans, and athletic shoes. Sports fans can choose from among the wide array of baseball caps and swag here, with all their favorite team logos on it. Empire Kicks also offers layaway."
"Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below), further expanded her West Side retail empire in 2013 with Global Chic, which complements the gifts, crafts and accessories offered in her original store with a full line of unique, vibrant fashions. Much like her other venture, Global Chic's multiethnic offerings boast a diversity that mirrors the multinational identity of Grant-Ferry itself; however, here the diverse styles are not merely placed side by side on the shelves and racks, but are more often combined within each piece into a delectable multicultural fusion that truly adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Custom alterations are also available."
"Hailing from Rwanda, Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano, cut her teeth as a founding member of the '''West Side Bazaar''' in 2011 before moving up the street the following year to inaugurate her own store, which has been described as a locally-based iteration of '''Ten Thousand Villages'''. At Global Villages, Sano sells a range of unique jewelry, accessories, soaps and bath items, and gifts that's been personally and expertly selected by her. The fashions here represent a diverse range of ethnic styles — from Kenya to Myanmar to India — and the authentic craft items for sale here encompass drums, baskets, objets d'art, decorative items, and more. A small range of literature, primarily on African topics, is also offered. Best of all, Sano prides herself on her extensive familiarity with her suppliers and their work, whether it be a traditional artisan in Thailand, a local crafter on the West Side, or Sano herself, who designs much of the jewelry stocked here. To top it all off, Global Villages' interior is brimming with character — the tin ceilings and original hardwood floors and transom windows are a remarkable preservation of the building's history."
"San-Bor Sports has been described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as an ""urban sports shop that has withstood the tests of time, and for that we are all lucky"". It's true. Owner Rick Bordieri has proven himself nothing if not adaptable, meeting the needs of West Side residents for over forty years even as the profile of the average West Side resident has changed and changed again. At San-Bor Sports a range of sporting goods is indeed sold, but the focus is more on sportswear, with a wide gamut of athletic shoes (including Converse and Air Jordans), baseball caps, custom sports jerseys, jeans, and other casual urban streetwear filling the shelves. In season, a range of bubble jackets, boots, and other cold-weather gear can be had to see customers through the bleak Buffalo winters. San-Bor's selection is impressive: there are some pretty hard-to-find items here, including a full line of t-shirts from '''Stacks and Kicks''', a boutique label headquartered right in Buffalo. The selection is curated by a knowledgeable staff that is thoroughly familiar with the products they sell, and service comes with genuine friendliness and appreciation every time."
"In March 2015, Rust Belt Books emerged from hibernation at a new location on Grant Street after leaving their previous home in Allentown. However, aside from the location little has changed: this is still one of the best, and best-loved, used bookstores in Buffalo or anywhere else. An exhaustive selection of reading material of every genre — from old cookbooks to '70s music journalism to esoteric feminist essays to the classics of literature — is available there for the book lover, with an enthusiastic and helpful staff and colorful clientele. More than that, Rust Belt Books' relentless devotion to the local community sees them playing host to a variety of community events, as well as poetry readings, plays and other special events."
"West Side Stores is a true gem — a friendly, cozy independent bookstore, well-kept yet unpretentious, that stocks a wide-ranging selection of over 12,000 gently used books ranging from biography to mystery to kids' books to sci-fi to the classics of literature, at prices that never exceed $10. Better still, this place is at the forefront of West Side businesses (no mean feat) when it comes to dedication to their neighborhood — they host community events on a frequent basis, donate free books to various worthy causes, and have a policy of one free book per visit offered to all children who stop in. Though West Side Stories is probably not the place to go if you've got a specific title in mind, its selection is nevertheless fascinating — all the more so given that everything they sell is acquired through donation (they'll pay you a price that's hard to beat for your gently used books!) A children's play area is available for parents who want some time to themselves while strolling the aisles, and the friendly couple that owns the place is always around for a friendly chat with customers, or to put their encyclopedic knowledge of their inventory to use in helping them find what they're looking for. West Side Stories also does a brisk side business selling used records ($3.50 each)."
"'''New World Record''' and '''Home of the Hits''' closed in the 2000s and '''Record Theatre''' is down to two struggling locations, but that hasn't dissuaded Black Dots' owner and sole employee, Joshua Smith, a former punk rocker and prolific record collector and trader native to Syracuse, from daring to buck the trend: his place is one of Buffalo's newest independent record stores, whose opening in June 2013 in the basement of a Lafayette Avenue flat was so audacious in the face of steeply declining sales of tangible music that the ''Buffalo News'' devoted a lengthy article to it. The store is named for the groundbreaking 1979 debut by D.C. punkers Bad Brains, and aptly so: Black Dots deals exclusively in new and used punk, hardcore, and indie releases on vinyl and cassette, to the exclusion of CDs, as well as a selection of stickers, patches and band t-shirts. Vinyl aficionados, devotees of underground music, and those who are curious about the local scene will be in heaven at Black Dots perusing the crates of rare releases by little-known bands in the well-worn interior; even the hand-scrawled sign, reminiscent of an old-school concert flyer, screams ""punk rock""."
"Since 2006, Luis Rodriguez has operated this small Grant Street record shop where the accent is on rap, R&B, reggae, soca, and Latin sounds, as well as racks of streetwear styled to match the hip-hop bent of the music. If you're interested in the local hip-hop scene, look no further: Sweet Sound stocks a wide selection of the latest releases by local rappers at prices that can't be beat."
"With a motto of ""Embeer Buffalo"", Community Beer Works is the city's first nanobrewery, proudly producing craft beer that's delicious and award-winning in quality: some of the accolades this place has earned include being named ""Best New Brewery in New York State"" for 2013 by ratebeer.com, as well as a second-place finish for its India Pale Ale in ''Brewing News'' magazine's 2013 National IPA Championships. Indeed, pale ales of various descriptions are the star products at Community Beer Works: its most popular brew, an American Pale Ale called ""Frank"", can be found on tap at well-known local spots like '''Allen Street Hardware''', '''Pano's''', and the '''Village Beer Merchant'''. They also have a retail store open three days a week where beer aficionados can come and fill their bottles and kegs — 32-ounce (946 ml) growlers for $7, 64-ounce (1,893 ml) growlers for $12, and kegs for $90 — or buy branded merchandise such as T-shirts, glasses and growlers. Best of all, Community Beer Works' commitment to the well-being of the Buffalo area is legendary: spent grain from the brewery is donated to the '''Massachusetts Avenue Project''' to be reused as fertilizer, and community pride and a sense of place are fostered in many other ways as well."
"Frontier Liquors opened in 1974, long before Grant Street had the cachet it does today — and as the neighborhood has continued its upswing, this place has really grown into its reputation as the place to go for a far-ranging selection of potent potables, including some hard-to-find wines and spirits that other Buffalo liquor stores don't carry. Frontier is no less impressive in the beer department, with all the usual brands in stock plus a nice range of craft brews from Upstate New York and elsewhere in the region. Ice and salty snacks are also sold to complement the alcohol. Delivery service is available, and, uniquely among liquor stores in the area, Frontier even offers event planning for those who may be planning a party or get-together. Unfortunately, the ""discount"" portion of this place's name is a bit of a misnomer, but fear not — frequent special deals and promotions are offered."
"This friendly neighborhood variety store proudly offers ""a little bit of everything... not a lot of anything"". That little bit of everything will be of particular interest to fans of kitsch; though there's a lot of junk here, buried within it are some great finds: quirky clothing, accessories, toys, gifts, and miscellaneous ephemera. Best of all, Between Yesterday & Tomorrow offers the kind of old-fashioned personal service with a smile that you can't get at Walmart or other big-box retailers."
"Opened in January 2013 in the Hampshire Street storefront formerly occupied by the beloved '''Burma Family Store''', Morning Star sells a little bit of everything. ""100% African"" is the motto that ties together the motley range of merchandise on offer here — from beauty supplies to groceries to a selection of secondhand clothes, DVDs, decorative items and other gifts."
"Newly moved to Grant Street from its longtime former home in the Elmwood Village, Sunday is the epicenter of Buffalo's tight-knit skateboard community. Founder J.P. Gillespie heads up a friendly staff that is passionate about their love of skating, providing helpful service to longtime customers and welcoming into the fold those who may be new to the sport. In addition to the first-rate selection of boards on offer there, a selection of clothing and gear is available at Sunday: sneakers (including the latest from such popular brands as Nike, Emerica, and Vans), socks, caps, T-shirts, hoodies, and skating videos. Speaking of which, Sunday is also known for the skate videos it produces and screens locally, featuring such illustrious Buffalo talent as Sal Viglietta, Tony Huffnagle, and Jake Donnelly."
"In March 2012, longtime Amherst Street resident Demetrius Williams opened The Jump-Off with a view not only to furthering the growth of Grant-Amherst as a small-business shopping destination, but also of its cultural life: his plans are to eventually hold open-mic events in store for local performers. For now, though, available at The Jump-Off is a respectable range of men's and women's clothing and accessories, united by a stylish yet streetwise urban aesthetic."
"Situated on the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road at the former site of the '''Adriatic Gardens''' restaurant, some of the crowded shelves and racks of this Yemeni-owned outlet are devoted to a respectable selection of colorful and glitzy ladies' fashions, including cute tops, formalwear, jewelry and accessories, and shoes. But above all, Mr. Millennium is best known for the wide range of menswear they carry. From designer jeans and t-shirts, to mens' jewelry and watches, to baseball caps (this place is a licensed dealer of '''New Era''' caps), to bubble jackets and hoodies, Mr. Millennium is the place for you if you're looking for urban-styled clothing of pretty much any permutation. The other half of the business is prepaid mobile phones, with phones and plans on offer from '''Boost Mobile''', '''Virgin Wireless''', and others. The sometimes rude customer service is a sticking point for visitors to Mr. Millennium, but the selection here is the best in the neighborhood, and they're open late."
"The name of the game at this aptly named Amherst Street store is one-of-a-kind customized T-shirts designed in-house. These guys do first-rate work and infuse their designs with the urban flair that has come to characterize the small but growing fashion scene in Grant-Amherst. The bulk of Shirtz' inventory is made up of creative graphic tees, including some with airbrush designs. A range of band tees, other designer clothes, and embroidery rounds out the selection here. Shirtz' staff has their ear to the ground when it comes to the local scene — they're active and highly sought-out in the production of music videos, commercials, and promotional videos for Buffalo-based businesses and artists — so if you're looking for something unique and characteristically Buffalo, you'd be well-advised to head here."
"Kathleen Arries is to be commended for truth in advertising: there are plenty of tchotchkes to be found in the ample Amherst Street storefront her business occupies. The 6,500 square feet (600m²) of retail space here are crammed to the gills with antiques of all descriptions: rare, original and unique examples of housewares, toys, clocks, baskets, and every miscellaneous trinket you could imagine that are the end result of over 100 years of family collecting. This is the kind of place you'd see on ""American Pickers"". Despite the vast variety of stuff to be found here, Chotchky's is at heart a small family business and a labor of love — Arries has been the sole employee of this shop since it opened in 1998. This place does a brisk mail-order business as well."
"Coo Coo U's owner, Michael Mensola, has a habit of being a pioneer in every new neighborhood in which he sets up shop — the business moved in 2012 to the former '''Jewett Refrigerator Warehouse''' off Military Road after spending the previous quarter-century on Hertel Avenue, and was located in Allentown before that. Coo Coo U is the alpha and omega in Buffalo when it comes to Mid-Century and Scandinavian Modern, whether it be furniture, decorative items, works of art, or all manner of other retro curiosities. Aficionados agree that the selection and quality of the items that fill this cavernous space is among the best anywhere, even holding its own with the best that places like Toronto and New York City have to offer. To be found here are a myriad of one-of-a-kind items with a fanciful postwar aesthetic — chairs, sofas, coffee tables, lamps and the like are joined by modernist paintings and sculptures, as well as musical instruments, jewelry, and elements of industrial and architectural design. You could easily spend a whole day here. Hours of operation are variable — don't be surprised if the owner opens the place up early or stays late, especially during special sales and promotions or around the holidays."
"Summer 2015 saw another addition to Grant-Amherst's roster of antique and vintage stores arrive at the former home of '''Puchalski's Florist''' — which, like its new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski, are longtime neighborhood fixtures. These two have been steadily growing their own collection of antiques and vintage collectibles for north of 30 years, and with Junk & Disorderly their bounty is now available to the buying public. And what a bounty it is — there's a ton of merchandise crammed into this little place, all as kitschy as the name implies. Going beyond the kitsch factor, it's rather difficult to generalize about the constantly changing lineup of merchandise that passes through Junk & Disorderly's doors, but midcentury vintage knickknacks seem to handily outnumber outright antiques (the cutoff date seems to be around World War II) and specialties seem to include lamps, kitchenware, and above all, a treasure trove of decorative Christmas baubles, vintage ornaments, and other holiday-themed items. But the inventory is a diverse hodgepodge — the owners are known to train their eyes on anything unusual or offbeat, and to travel long distances to do so, with merchandise sourced from estate sales, swap meets, and flea markets across the Northeast. Junk & Disorderly's opening hours aren't what you would call extensive, but if you can't make it to Grant Street on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon but happen to be heading eastward after your visit to Buffalo, you might catch the owners at their table at the Ontario Antique Mall in Canandaigua."
"Amherst Street Wine and Liquor is located across the parking lot from '''Wegmans''' supermarket and is owned by the same family — and though eyebrows were raised upon its December 2014 opening, which was seen by some as an end-run around the New York state law that prohibits supermarkets from selling liquor, Wegmans' legions of admirers will probably be pleased with the similarities between the two businesses: aisles and shelves organized more like a supermarket than a typical liquor store, a selection whose size and variety befits a big-box warehouse retailer, and customer service that is second to none in friendliness, helpfulness and knowledge of their product. Your Wegmans Shoppers Club Card is even good there. If you're here for wine, you'll find lots of imported vintages as well as domestics from California and the Finger Lakes, but sadly, if you're after a local wine (say, from Niagara County or the Lake Erie Wine Trail), you'll likely leave disappointed. Prices are generally average compared to other liquor stores — the mom-and-pops don't have to worry just yet — but there's always a selection of $6 wines for those on a budget as well as a locked room of rare and high-end wines if you're in the mood to really splurge. Wine tastings are also held on a frequent basis. As for liquors, the bases are covered with all the usual products as well as occasional surprises such as ''metaxa'' (Greek brandy) and other harder-to-find items, again at average prices."
"Since 1995, Michael Gambino has helmed this family-owned and operated liquor store where first-rate value for money is married to the professional, courteous service of the highest order they provide to their loyal customers. Gambino Liquors styles itself as ""Your One-Stop Liquor Shop"", and that's no exaggeration — it stocks one of Buffalo's widest selections of beer, wine, and (especially) spirits of every description imaginable, as well as mixers, snack foods, and various and sundry other goodies. But what Gambino is perhaps best-known for is their affordable prices — nowhere in the area can you get products of such a high quality for more affordable prices. Delivery is available, too."
"Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization dedicated to helping low-income individuals and families find housing, operates two locations of ReStore in Buffalo. The original one is located on Amherst Street. What ReStore amounts to is basically a huge thrift store for furniture and housewares: the shelves are stocked with gently used (and some new!) chairs and tables, sofas, bedroom sets, lamps, cabinetry, doors and windows, building materials, and appliances donated to them by the public. Best of all, this place operates with very little overhead — it's staffed by volunteers, so almost all the money you pay goes to help Habitat for Humanity build new homes and rehab old ones to help out the less fortunate. Prices at ReStore are great, but to sweeten the pot a little, they run sales and promotions occasionally, and offer 10% discounts to college students. If you want to give back, donations are accepted at the store during business hours, or you can schedule a pickup."
"Spar's European Sausage Shop was founded in 1989 by Eric Spar, a native of Augsburg, Germany, and purchased by its current owner, Spar's former apprentice Joe Kennedy, in 2005. This place was recognized as selling the ""Best Sausage in Buffalo"" five years in a row by ''Artvoice'' in their annual ""Best of Buffalo"" poll, and it's not hard to see why: this place deals in what is easily the city's widest variety of sausages, both fresh and smoked, handcrafted on the premises using only the freshest and finest ingredients. Not surprisingly, German selections such as bratwurst, knockwurst and weisswurst are predominant, but this place sells literally every kind of sausage you can imagine: Swedish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Polish and Italian sausages, chorizo, andouille, ''merguez'', double-smoked ''kabanosy'', and on and on. And if Spar's doesn't carry your favorite type of sausage, they'll custom-prepare it for you. Though the sausages are obviously the star of the show, Spar's sells a variety of steaks and chops, cheeses, deli meats including homemade bologna, and specialty groceries that split the difference between imported items and local favorites such as '''Broadway Market''' horseradish, '''Scharf's Schiller Park''' German salad dressing, '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard, and '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas."
"Much like its counterparts on the other end of Grant Street, Yasin African Market is a destination for those in search of ethnic groceries and halal meats such as fish, lamb, goat and chicken. However, Yasin African Market does its competition one better by offering an interesting selection of other goods such as handbags and purses, as well as gifts including some surprisingly high-quality carpets."
"Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski were in business on Amherst Street long before it became a happening strip on the newly hip West Side: they opened up their eponymous Fundalinski Studio in 1982. Both the owners are certified members of the '''Professional Photographers of America''', and Bogdan is also a multiple-time Kodak Gallery Award winner. Fundalinski Studio mostly handles portrait photography, but a brisk secondary business here is selling archival-quality prints of the artists' original work — both Janice's placid nature scenes and Bogdan's colorful, whimsical fantasy images."
"S & M Market looks like just another corner bodega of the type that's so common on the West Side, but a peek inside is sure to surprise the unsuspecting visitor. S & M began life in 2009 as a friendly, all-purpose bedding and linen store; indeed, the bread and butter of the inventory here is still a full slate of sheets, comforters, and a wide variety of original blankets (including Disney designs) to fit all bed sizes, as well as mattresses and pillowtops for unbeatable prices. Towels, curtains, rugs, and carpets are on offer as well. However, newly armed with a food store license, S & M expanded its oeuvre in 2012, and now boasts an intriguing mishmash of wares including high-quality hookah pipes, a variety of halal meats, body oils and perfumes, and more."
"The Serendipity Shoppe is back — after being displaced two years previously by construction at its previous home, Elmwood Avenue's '''Lafayette Presbyterian Church''', Buffalo's favorite high-end secondhand store reopened in summer 2014 on burgeoning Amherst Street. The location has changed, but the goods on the shelves remain the same: this place specializes in fine-quality, previously-owned jewelry, artwork, books, furniture, home decor, collectibles, and more (but, interestingly, ''not'' clothing). There's some really unique and offbeat finds here, the kind of stuff you don't generally see at thrift shops, and fans of quirky vintage styles are in luck. Best of all, your money goes to a good cause: the Serendipity Shoppe is run on a not-for-profit basis, with all proceeds benefiting the '''Buffalo AIDS Plus Fund''', which helps residents of the eight-county Western New York area living with HIV and AIDS. Tax-deductible donations are accepted; see website for details."
"The central node of a trio of related shops on the corner of Niagara and Hudson Streets, Kings of da West sells West Siders a variety of new and secondhand urban clothing, shoes, jewelry, and fashion accessories as well as a small variety of cigarettes and smoking supplies. Ladies aren't left out in the cold either: '''Queens of da West''' extends the business into the storefront next door, with ladieswear, purses and other accessories, wigs, and fragrance on offer in similar styles. Lastly, '''Kings Wireless''' is a destination for cell phones and accessories as well as electronics repair."
"Newly moved to Connecticut Street from its former home in Allentown, Positive Approach Press works with customers to create custom-designed screen-printed t-shirts, sweatshirts, and even jackets and pants, handcrafted in-house by some of the best designers Western New York has to offer. The folks at Positive Approach offer great rates and even better turnaround times (less than seven days in most cases) and will also custom-design business cards, posters, wedding invitations, stationery, and other paper goods."
"After a successful run in the downtown Theater District during the 2015 holiday season as a '''Queen City Pop-Up''' shop, RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard, moved their line of handmade clothing, accessories and custom artwork to the newly renovated '''Club Utica''' building in the heart of Five Points. As newcomers to Buffalo (they originally hail from Shreveport, Louisiana), the Ballards were conscious from the start that networking with others in the local arts community would make or break their business, and on the shelves at RudeBoyz you can find a wide variety of jewelry, decorative baubles, and others goods produced in limited quantities by local artisans. The dominant presence, though, is Qean's: a street artist by trade, you can find his signature aesthetic — graffiti-inspired designs tempered by superhero and Japanese anime motifs, as well as other influences — all over the place, but especially in the custom artwork he creates in the studio in the store's back room. You can even bring in your own clothing and commission him to airbrush or screen-print custom designs on them. RudeBoyz also serves as a nexus for Buffalo artists with the temporary exhibitions that often grace the store's walls, as well as the music concerts and community functions held there."
"Authentic and gritty with no hint of the supermarket gloss of '''Wegmans''' (or even '''Tops''' on Niagara Street), Á Châu International Market's crowded aisles are stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of Indian, African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Included in the inventory are delicious and unusual meats, fresh fish, a blockbuster selection of Asian produce such as durian, bok choy, and flaming hot Thai chilies, tea and energy drinks, frozen foods, and in the words of one reviewer, ""every kind of spice, edible sea critter, and sauce you could ever ask for"". If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, this is not a bad place to stop into. Á Châu's helpful employees — who double as the owners of '''Niagara Seafood''', the Vietnamese restaurant next door — are happy to assist customers in navigating the disorganized clutter. They even sell chopsticks, woks, and other housewares. A word of warning, however: the ""authentic Asian grocery"" part of this blurb is not to be taken lightly, meaning that the squeamish may need to avert their gaze from sights like whole frozen bullfrogs in the freezer cases, buckets of freshly eviscerated organ meats, and whole ducks, chickens and rabbits strung up as window displays. There's also a smaller satellite location on the East Side."
"Situated on bustling Connecticut Street a stone's throw from '''Masjid al-Eiman''', Arbin Halal Meat is a new food store that stocks a modest but intriguing selection of halal meat, fresh produce, and dry groceries geared toward Buffalo's growing Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indian population. In addition to what's already been mentioned, Arbin also stocks large sacks of ''channa daal'' and other grains, Indian spices, a small range of Islamic clothing, as well as Western-style snack foods and a surprisingly ample selection of household goods. At Arbin the aisles are cramped and the shelves are not particularly well organized, but the small size of the store means that if they carry it, you'll probably find it before too long."
"The hipster-fication of the West Side logged another benchmark in December 2015 with the opening of this specialty shop dedicated to all things pickled and fermented, situated in the heart of the historic West Village a literal stone's throw away from '''Johnson Park'''. Owner R.J. Marvin is a self-styled ""Willy Wonka of pickles"", a 17-year veteran of the local restaurant industry who, while working at the '''Elm Street Bakery''' in East Aurora, hit on the idea of a store that sold unusual varieties of pickles, made in-house from local produce. Flash forward to opening weekend, when he and his wife/partner Lindsey had to abruptly close up shop the day after their grand opening after completely selling out of all their stock; the lines had been out the door all day long. Barrel + Brine's selections change frequently — on a given day you'll find creative twists on everyday favorites such as sauerkraut (""classic recipe"" as well as homemade kimchee and red beet and caraway kraut) and pickled cucumbers (both full sours and bread-and-butter varieties; popular favorites include the ""Million Dollar Pickle"" based on an old Amish recipe, the self-explanatory ""Bloody Mary Pickle"", and a ""Southern Tier IPA Pickle"" with fresh hops added to the spice blend), as well as more exotic finds such as fennel-pickled beets, Chinese-style pickled peanuts, ''kkakdugi'' (Korean-style spicy pickled radishes), pickled watermelon rind, and pickled sausage sourced from '''Spar's''' on Amherst Street."
"Buffalo Grocery & Halal Meats is owned by the same people who run '''United Super Bazaar''' on West Ferry Street, and the selection of items is much the same as well — ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, African, Spanish, [and] American food and spices"" are proudly touted on the exterior sign. Like its newer counterpart, though, in reality the selection here isn't as impressive as all that, and skews far more heavily in favor of the Subcontinental and Southeast Asian sides of the equation than the Arabian, African or Latino."
"Along with a range of hair and beauty supplies, braiding, cosmetics, and ethnic clothing, African food is the specialty at this newly established market at the north end of the Niagara Street strip. A modest variety of both fresh and frozen groceries are available for aficionados of the cuisines of West and Central Africa. Also, for anglers who are keen on trying their luck at nearby '''Broderick Park''' or elsewhere along the West Side riverfront, live bait is offered for sale."
"Established in 1950 by West Side native Frank Caruana, The Chocolate Shop is a longstanding neighborhood mainstay that has delighted thousands of Buffalonians over the years. Caruana learned from the best, cutting his teeth at the legendary '''Merkens Chocolate Company''' on Jersey Street before striking out on his own, hand-dipping and hand-molding the confections at first before the sheer volume of his shop's popularity forced him to invest in automated machinery. Years later, The Chocolate Shop is still in business custom-molding chocolates to its customers' specifications, whether it be reproducing a sample item or bringing their zaniest fantasies to life in chocolate form. The bulk of the Chocolate Shop's business is corporate orders and fundraisers, but at their Niagara Street retail location can be found a range of chocolates and candies (including sponge candy, Buffalo's favorite chocolate treat) as well as personalized gift packs made fresh daily with only the finest ingredients."
"In the words of their website, Five Points Bakery is all about ""raising the bar on local food"" and ""striv[ing] to overcome the limitations of our food system and reclaim our food heritage through education... and a dedication to sustainability"". Sound a bit high-concept and expensive? It is, but visitors who persevere past their initial reaction to Five Points' prices soon see that what's sold there is worth splurging for. After a brief hiatus, this heaven for foodies is now reopened in a new location around the corner from the original — a spectacularly restored turn-of-the-century brick block with greatly expanded seating at tables and along the bar. As well, in summer there's additional seating on a rear patio that's one of the most pleasant and distinctive in town: rustic furniture and adobe-colored stucco applied to the walls and foundation of a former outbuilding give it a distinctly Southwestern feel. There's Ethernet ports for laptop jockeys, and both dining room and patio have kids' play areas that are fully stocked with toys, games and books. But the core of the business remains the same: homemade artisanal multigrain, whole-wheat and ciabatta breads made with organically-grown grain from right here in Western New York (specifically, the Zittle Farm in Hamburg), along with delectable pastry — their huge cinnamon rolls are a favorite. Folks especially like the toast bar, where you can choose from various breads to pop in the toaster and top with your choice of honey, peanut butter, and various fruit compotes and cheese spreads. As always, vegans and those with special dietary needs will be delighted that all ingredients are scrupulously labelled."
"The sign on the outside of this bodega, located on the corner of Massachusetts and Plymouth Avenues where '''Mama's Kitchen''' used to be, proudly advertises ""fresh produce, halal meats, and variety groceries"". Sadly, that's an exaggeration (as is the place's name). At Less Price there's no meat at all and only a small freezer full of frozen vegetables, with the inventory mostly given over to general groceries, kitchenwares, toiletries, and snack foods and other corner-store fare. However, they do offer a small selection of Indian and South Asian spices, dried chilies, cooking oil, and ethnic snack foods that might do in a pinch if you've got a hankering for Indian food but are missing a few ingredients."
"Mike's Tropical Market is a popular gathering place for the West Side's burgeoning Latino community, a crowded little corner store jam-packed with specialty groceries including a huge range of Goya products. This is probably the best place in the city for those in search of ingredients for delicious Puerto Rican and Dominican recipes who want a more distinctive experience than what's offered at a supermarket. One-upping other bodegas in the area, Mike's also boasts a sizable frozen-foods section, a small selection of quality butcher meats and deli items, and fresh tropical (and other) produce. Best of all, Mike's carries a great selection of specialty coffees at prices that can't be beat."
"Mineo & Sapio is arguably Buffalo's favorite locally-produced brand of sausage — and almost inarguably its best-loved Italian sausage. The business has built a sterling reputation from its humble beginnings in 1920, founded by John Mineo as a neighborhood meat market on the main drag of the Italian West Side, to a ubiquitous presence in the meat coolers of Western New York supermarkets and on the tables of some of the city's finest restaurants. In addition to their most famous product (which comes in both links and patties, sweet or spicy), Mineo & Sapio also manufactures chicken sausage, andouille sausage and chorizo, delicious Italian meatballs, meatloaf, and, most recently, several varieties of stuffed hot peppers. Uniting all these products is an unrelenting emphasis on quality — their classic-recipe Italian sausage uses 100% pork with no preservatives or artificial colors, the chicken is a boneless and skinless mix of white and dark meat, and the sausages are packed in all-natural hog casings. Best of all, despite the growth of the business, Mineo & Sapio's Connecticut Street retail store retains a friendly, intimate atmosphere — impregnated with the delicious aroma of sausage spices, to boot. Frozen sausage of the same type that's sold in grocery stores can be bought there, but since you have the opportunity, you really want to go for the fresh stuff."
"'''Horsefeathers Market''' is the home to the newest entry in Buffalo's growing roster of vegan restaurants and food shops: Nature's Apothecary is where Elena Capozzi, a young entrepreneur and recent graduate of the '''Institute for Integrated Nutrition''', shares her knowledge of and enthusiasm for healthy, holistic eating — not to mention her wonderfully prepared recipes — for hungry folks from across Western New York. The stock in trade here is a mix of yummy baked goods (so delicious that more than one reviewer outright refused to believe they were as healthy as claimed!) as well as raw salads, cold-pressed juices and smoothies, and other prepared foods, all of which are made from organic, sustainably sourced ingredients with no meat, dairy, or corn syrup, and prepared so as to retain as many of the original vitamins and nutrients as possible from the source foods. All items sold at Nature's Apothecary are meticulously labeled with not only a list of ingredients, but a brief description of how each one is beneficial to the body. While most business is to go, there's also limited indoor seating."
"It's not the largest Asian food store on the West Side, but the Niagara Asian Market is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside — and far better-organized than most of its competition! This store stocks mostly Burmese and Thai items and is set up for the maximum convenience of customers who are in search of the essentials of Asian cuisine, with a friendly staff that is eager to assist those who may still need a bit of help finding what they need. The Niagara Asian Market is two floors of deliciousness, with fresh Asian produce, frozen meats (including unique items such as frog and eel), and staples such as noodles and rice downstairs, and the upper level given over to packaged groceries and a range of health and beauty items. A drawback is the store's exterior signage, which is written almost entirely in Burmese, making the place easily missable from the street."
"After four years spent in the Elmwood Village, the grand reopening of Buffalo's favorite purveyor of ""udderly unique"" cheeses and other gourmet edibles was a gala event at '''Horsefeathers Market''' in August 2016. Nickel City Cheese's new location is much larger, and really done up nice — like the rest of Horsefeathers, it's an airy space that mixes 19th-century rustic with 21st-century industrial chic, with exposed brick and wood-panelled everything coexisting with trendy exposed ductwork on the ceiling. But the heart and soul of the place remains the same: a selection of domestic and imported cheeses that is second to none in the local area, all cut to order, plus a wide variety of artisanal specialty foods such as jams, pickles, coffees, pasta, mustards, vinegars, sauces, and marinades. And if you're looking for a gift, you can't go wrong with Nickel City Cheese's custom-made gift baskets and cheese-and-charcuterie platters. Best of all, though, with their expansion into new digs has also come an expansion into a whole new arena of business: owner Jill Gedra Forster also operates a full-service restaurant in the adjacent space, '''Lait Cru Brasserie''', open for breakfast and lunch ''(q.v.)''."
"Phu Thai is a family-operated Asian market that was established in 1994, more than a decade before the West Side retail scene was transformed by a tidal wave of similar ethnic food stores. In stark contrast to the pan-Asian selection at supermarkets like '''Sung's''' and '''Hoowa''' — and even to the pan-Southeast Asian inventory at West Side competitors like '''Á Châu''' and the '''Niagara Asian Market''' — the groceries available along these jumbled, narrow aisles are almost exclusively Thai in provenance. Staples such as dried noodles and huge sacks of rice, spices, sauces and cooking oils, and a variety of packaged foods are on offer; in the coolers along the walls are a small selection of vegetables (produce delivery day is Thursday, so try to show up around then if you're in the market for Thai chilies, fresh ginger, or other exotic greens) and a surprisingly ample one of frozen meats and fish. Pluses for this place are a decent variety of good-quality housewares and what must be the best selection of Southeast Asian soft drinks in Buffalo; drawbacks include an unfortunate tendency to not label their merchandise with prices."
"Though co-owners Neil and Carrie grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables on this lovely agricultural oasis in the heart of the West Side, one look at the name and there's no secret to what the specialties here are. On the one hand you've got onions and garlic — those are the ""alliums"" — but more noteworthy than that is the astonishing selection of herbs they cultivate: multiple different varieties of basil, mint, sage, and rosemary; other well-known pantry staples like parsley, oregano, and dill; not-so-well-known ones like lemon balm and buzz buttons, and an encyclopedic range of medicinal herbs that are perfect for teas and tinctures. Whatever your pleasure, these folks take care to provide their customers with a product that's high in quality and produced in an environmentally conscious way — all of West Side Herbs & Alliums' produce is grown without the use of pesticides, in raised beds so as to sidestep the issue of soil contamination that is the bane of urban farmers across the Rust Belt. And, if you can't make it over on Friday evenings when the onsite farm stand is open, you can buy up these vegetal goodies on Saturday mornings at the '''Elmwood-Bidwell Farmers Market''' or sample them as ingredients at a number of local restaurants including the West Side's own '''Providence Social'''."
"Much more than the average corner bodega that it appears to be from the outside, Zip's Deli and Grill actually carries a full line of ethnic groceries that splits the difference between Middle Eastern (a great selection of halal meats such as chicken and lamb, as well as packaged goods) and Latino (Goya products galore). Groceries are only the beginning, though — at Zip's you can find items as widely varied as hookah pipes, blankets, and prepaid cell phones, and even have your electronics repaired at hard-to-beat prices. The chummy friendliness with which the Arabian owners treat their customers is the icing on the cake."
"This is not your ordinary bookstore, but if you're on the lookout for a unique gift for that hard-to-buy-for far-left radical on your list, Burning Books probably has what you're looking for. Helmed by Nate Buckley, a former '''Earth Liberation Front''' spokesperson whose other claim to fame involves a lengthy legal battle stemming from his arrest at '''Occupy Buffalo''', sold here are an array of books, magazines, and leaflets regarding a diversity of themes of social injustice and revolutionary politics — histories, biographies, reference materials, and even kids' books on topics from the Black Panthers to the Stonewall Riots to the Zapatistas; in the words of one reviewer, ""books that people in power don't want you to read"". T-shirts, calendars, posters, and a selection of documentary films on DVD and audio recordings of speeches and lectures round out the inventory, and concerts, guest speakers, panel discussions, and other events are held frequently. True to its mission and the personality of its soft-spoken yet outgoing owner (this place has doubtless been the scene of some of the most interesting political conversations in the city), the interior of Burning Books is all business: a minimalist scheme of unfinished wood panels draws no attention away from the socially conscious literature for sale. Best of all, the prices here are decidedly 99%-friendly."
"Snicker all you want at its name, but the selection of red wine at this newly established West Side liquor store is no joke. In the short time since it's been founded, Beaver Liquors has already earned accolades for the range and quality of its vintages. Wine is only the beginning here, though — this place also does a brisk business, seven days a week, in a great variety of reasonably-priced spirits of all kinds which trend heavily toward well-known upscale brands. Best of all, curious fans of potent potables can enjoy an active schedule of wine and liquor tastings."
"Opened in March 2015, this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise, is a former pastry chef turned self-described ""wine nerd"" who, before she struck out on her own, was a favorite at Amherst's '''Premier Wines & Spirits''' for her encyclopedic knowledge of wines (especially local vintages), discriminating palate, and natural way with customer service. Little wonder, then, that Paradise Wines has already made quite the name for itself in Five Points. With a huge range of products that you won't find anywhere else, Paradise's inventory eschews big-name vintages completely and consists solely of a handpicked selection of organic, biodynamic, sustainably crafted wines (and ciders, craft spirits) sourced from small family wineries in the local area. You might think that all this high-concept stuff is out of your price range, but think again: an integral part of this place's mission is making holistically produced products available to those of all budgets, and the owner is enthusiastic about sharing her treasure trove of wine knowledge to serve each customer's individual needs and palate."
"Newly opened, West Side Liquor & Wine is at the center of the action on Connecticut Street. This is a cute little place, brightly lit and with a cozy ambience, and the friendly employees are eager to steer customers toward some of the best-priced libations in the city — in fact, if you find the same product for less money anywhere in Buffalo, they will beat or match the price. The selection leaves something to be desired, but for those on a budget, West Side Liquors is the place to go. Those who are planning large parties will be happy to know that you can save even more money buying in bulk."
"When she's not tearing up the local rollerderby scene as part of the '''Queen City Roller Girls''', Ilana Gordon can often be found at this out-of-the-way West Side skate shop that she owns. Recreational roller skates, inline skates, and roller-hockey gear are all sold at Turnaround Skates, but the bias here is toward rollerderby gear. As many experienced skaters will tell you, beginners to the sport often battle foot and leg pain that comes from ill-fitting skates lacking in support; one of the goals here is to head that off at the pass, providing customers with honest, expert one-on-one guidance on skates and protective gear to fit their individual needs. The selection is wide and friendly to all budgets — quality brands including Pro-Tec, Atom Wheels, and Sure-Grip are represented on the shelves, and Ilana will even special-order products that aren't in stock for those searching for a specific brand or item. Turnaround's experienced staff provide custom in-store fittings, and you can even trade in old skates for store credit to maximize the already great value you get for your money. Cap off your purchases with stylish skatewear such as hot pants, laces and socks (Day-Glo colors abound). The folks here are friendly as can be and really know their stuff."
"Urban Roots is a ""community garden center"" that was founded in 2004 by a group of longtime West Side green thumbs who sought an opportunity to spend their hard-earned dollars in the city rather than wasting time and money driving to suburbia for gardening supplies, as well as to help build synergy with their neighbors to promote the beautification and revival of their up-and-coming, but still struggling, neighborhood. Their store opened three years later in the Five Points district, and is run as a cooperative: $100 will buy you lifetime status as a ""member-owner"" with access to exclusive promotions and discounts, first notification of special events and new items in stock, and a voice in store policy. However, you don't need to be a member to shop at Urban Roots! Locals can peruse a gamut of plants of uncommon quality — from the everyday to the unusual, including annuals, perennials, trees, herbs, heirloom plants, and local flora — and if you're a visitor, you can still avail yourself of supplies and accessories such as gardening gloves, flowerpots, bird feeders and birdhouses, cute garden art, and books on gardening, as well as an encyclopedic range of seeds, including '''Baker's Creek''' heirloom seeds and organic, non-GMO '''Seeds of Change'''. Urban Roots' merchandise tends to be pricey, but your money goes to a great cause, and you get a higher-quality product than you'll find elsewhere. Plus, their selection is huge, especially given the modest size of the store, and there's even space left over for frequent seminars, workshops, and seed swaps offered free of charge to members and non-members alike."
"Located in the '''Dollar General''' shopping plaza on Tonawanda Street in Black Rock, Eve Fashion is a place where clothes, cosmetics, and hair care products are available at prices that defy logic. This store is ''crowded'' — the walls are covered from floor-to-ceiling with merchandise on hangers, and the sales floor is packed with displays — but bargain hunters know that means the selection at Eve can go toe-to-toe with the big department stores. Vivacious tops, dresses, and accessories such as belts and sunglasses represent sassy urban styles, name-brand sneakers at discount prices are available, the selection of jewelry and earrings (big hoops are a recurring motif) is impressive, and fans of pretty much any sports franchise can find their favorite team's baseball cap — but the crown jewel of Eve's inventory is a comprehensive range of hair accessories such as barrettes, beads, pins and clips, as well as styling products for all hair types. As well, the back of the store is given over to a selection of wigs in a variety of styles. Best of all, Eve's staff is friendly and helpful, and those who are interested in taking advantage of Eve's extended evening hours will be happy to know that the place is kept safe under the watchful eye of a collection of security cameras."
"This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, is not known for the great diversity of its selection. Nor are folks who come looking for usual thrift-store fare — kooky vintage clothing, hip band t-shirts, designer jeans, and the like — likely to leave satisfied. There ''are'' bargains to be had at Hearts, but the order of the day at this ""businesswoman's thrift store"" (as one reviewer put it) is high-end office attire and formalwear, in tip-top condition and generally dating no earlier than the late 1990s, at prices that can't be beat. Many of the items that fill the racks on the crowded sales floor are sold for as little as $3.00, and occasionally even less. As well, Hearts stocks jewelry, shoes, toys, housewares, and miscellaneous gifts, and boasts an ample selection of kids' clothing. Best of all, the money you spend here could not go to a better cause: the store was set up to benefit '''Hearts for the Homeless''', a faith-based charity that feeds, counsels and ministers to the homeless population of Buffalo. Those who want to donate new or gently used clothing, accessories, or housewares can do so whenever the store is open, and online donations are also accepted through PayPal."
"Recently moved to a new location on Niagara Street right on the border between Black Rock and Riverside, 3 Star Fashion will be familiar to those who enjoy the selection of designer sneakers at '''Empire Kicks''', located on West Ferry Street and run by the same owners. Like its sister store, the fundament of this place's inventory consists of Nikes, Timberlands, Air Jordans and other well-known brands of footwear, but there's also a full range of name-brand clothing for the streetwise man, woman or child on your list, as well as a blockbuster selection of fitted New Era caps. Notably, 3 Star is also a great place to seek out designer jeans at reasonable prices."
"Don't be fooled by first impressions: this small, unassuming Black Rock storefront on a mostly residential stretch of Niagara Street houses a real heavyweight of the local retail scene. Here you can purchase Tomahawk brand leather goods — coats, vests and jackets, biker gear, accessories such as belts, gloves and handbags, wallets, backpacks and on and on — produced right in Western New York and united by an unrelenting emphasis on quality. This stuff is really top-of-the-line: it's no wonder Tomahawk leatherware sells for a pretty penny at fine department stores in the area, but at their Niagara Street outlet you can get it for 50 to 70% off retail prices. As if that weren't enough, a ""web discount"" is available for those who call Tomahawk's toll-free number, and customers who live outside New York State can have items shipped to them with sales tax — and in some cases, even shipping charges — waived."
"The big, '50s-looking '''Streng Oldsmobile''' sign just past Exit 13 is a familiar landmark to those Western New Yorkers whose daily commute takes them along the northbound I-190, but what many of them don't know is that the junk lot on which it sits isn't a junk lot at all: it's Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts. Family-owned and operated since 1971, Gothic City specializes in restoring historic homes and buildings with proper period architectural elements — but even if you don't own a drafty old Victorian of your own, anyone who's looking for that perfect piece to bring character to their home would be well-advised to spend a day here. Gothic City's massive footprint includes not only the lot visible from the Interstate — a full acre (4,000 squ. m.) filled with planters, statuary, garden tchotchkes, old lampposts, and the famous sign that once stood guard outside the Oldsmobile dealership on Main Street — but also 19,000 square feet (1,750 squ. m.) of showroom and warehouse space in the restored former '''Unity Temple''' Masonic lodge, which contains a dizzying array of antique furniture, lamps and sconces, doors and doorknobs, mantels, vintage plumbing fixtures such as sinks and claw bathtubs, and even a fine collection of ornamental ironwork and religious artifacts. Other antiques, such as toys and collectibles, are also represented. This place is only open three days a week, but no matter — if you're here at the beginning of the week, just get into contact with owner Charlie Leone and he'll open up shop for you if he can."
"Once a drive-in ice cream stand, contained within this unassuming little building in Riverside is a dazzling wealth of delicious Middle Eastern foods. Not surprisingly, baked goods are the star of the show here — the fresh, crusty bread whipped up in-house every day by friendly owner Omar Aldulaimi comes in several varieties, all out of this world, and he'll also bake custom orders if you call in advance — but at Aldulaimi Bakery you also have your pick of hummus, falafel, cheese, and delicious Levantine pastries. This is as authentic as it gets in Buffalo, so don't miss out."
"An anonymous-looking industrial park backed up against the old '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks in an out-of-the-way corner of Black Rock may seem like an odd place for Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers to locate one of their seven Western New York-area chocolate shops — but after all, this is the same building where their chocolate factory has been located since 1993. Unsurprisingly, the small retail space just off the production floor keeps abbreviated hours compared to the other Fowler's locations, but if you happen to be in the neighborhood on a weekday morning or afternoon and have a hankering for sponge candy, chocolate truffles, or any of the other goodies these folks are famous for, you're more than welcome to stop in."
"Gondola Macaroni Products is a longstanding local business whose deep West Side roots endure despite the radical changes the surrounding neighborhood has undergone since 1958. That's the year when Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''', designed and built his own pasta maker and began cooking ravioli in the kitchen of the West Side house he shared with his wife Maria — ravioli which quickly became a neighborhood sensation. Ravioli is still the marquee product customers line up for in this cramped little shop in Black Rock. It's made daily in-house from scratch with a simple recipe of durum flour, water, and eggs — there's no additives or chemicals in this stuff, which is likely why its quality puts supermarket fare to shame. Into the ravioli are stuffed your choice of cheese, meat, spinach, or lobster (imitation — it's only $4 a tray, after all — but still delicious), and they along with other filled pastas like cheese tortellini and stuffed shells are available fresh or frozen. Gondola's dried pasta boasts a bit more variety; options range from the expected (plain, angel hair, roasted red pepper, garlic pesto) to the unexpected (squid ink?!?) All this for prices that can hold their own with much larger players like '''Wegmans''' and '''Tops''', and served to you with a smile by owners that obviously appreciate your business, even if their English isn't quite up to snuff."
"Yet another in the seemingly endless parade of Burmese grocery stores on the West Side, Htar Ni Asian Market is located on Ontario Street toward the north end of Riverside. Inside, you'll find walls lined with rows upon rows of canned goods, jars of preserved vegetables, packaged groceries, frozen foods, and crunchy snacks. If you like Sriracha and other spicy Asian sauces and condiments, Htar Ni is the place for you."
"The second, somewhat larger location of this place that opened in Riverside in December 2014 features more of the same specialty Asian groceries that you can find at Lin's Grant Street location. The store is connected directly to '''Lin Restaurant''' next door, so if you just finished dining and you want to try your hand at making your own version of the Burmese and Thai specialties served there, you're in luck."
"Owners Ed & Brian Hogle worked in the construction industry for over a quarter century before striking out on their own in 2004, setting up shop in the former '''Black Rock Harbor Commons''' warehouse complex and translating their experience in structural iron- and steelwork into designing customized works of metal art, handcrafted with expert precision by their experienced staff using the latest in computerized design technology. Steel Crazy Iron Art specializes in ""gifts for the ungiftable"" — they'll custom-design everything from key racks to desk mounts to custom-themed clocks, and they're even responsible for many of the bright blue ""buffalo head"" bike racks you see along the sidewalk in trendy neighborhoods like the Elmwood Village and Allentown. Military-themed items are particularly popular; American servicepeople are honored with specially designed medallions, wall hangings, personalized dog tags, and the like representative of every branch of the U.S. military. Similar goods are available for police officers and firefighters, and even that hard-to-buy-for dentist or chiropractor on your list are covered with stainless-steel wall hangings in the shape of spinal columns and teeth!"
"Custom-designed stained and beveled glass windows — produced and delivered with, in their words, ""old-world craftsmanship and service"" — is the specialty at this renowned workshop that recently moved from Grant-Amherst to the former '''Jubilee Library''' in Black Rock, right next door to '''Gothic City Antiques'''. The designs favored by owner Jace Totaro tend toward abstract patterns, but he and the other craftsmen at Totaro Stained Glass are happy to help bring to life any idea the customer may have. The staff here is also known for their expertise at restoring and repairing antique stained glass windows."
"The small size of this neighborhood liquor store at the north end of Riverside belies the huge variety of name-brand beers, wines and spirits available within. What's more, City Liquor's staff is knowledgeable and friendly and sells its wares for some of the best prices around."
"Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store is located, as it has been since 1943, just across the street from Riverside Park. Though a wide variety of potent libations are on offer at this friendly neighborhood business, the specialty at the Nuchereno Liquor Store is an ample selection of fine wines of all descriptions, carefully stored in a temperature-controlled environment at a constant temperature of 55°F (12°C) for maximum quality."
"At Big Catch Bait & Tackle, the name only tells half the story. Sure, it's a great place to pick up pretty much any type of bait you want, live or otherwise. Sure, its location on Niagara Street in Black Rock is convenient to lots of great fishing spots and boat launches on the upper Niagara River. Sure, you can get wholesale fishing tackle, pick up a New York State hunting or fishing license, and stock up on various and sundry other outdoor goods. But Big Catch also does double duty as a purveyor of a modest but high-quality range of paintball guns and supplies, with an emphasis on Tippmann brand products — the A-5 and X7 Phenom guns are particular favorites that are sold at great prices, and CO2 refills don't come cheaper anywhere in Western New York. Best of all, no matter whether you're a fisherman or a paintballer, the staff at Big Catch will provide you with helpful and friendly service to match the great deals."
"Even in the 21st Century, there are still a lot of folks who come to Buffalo by boat — perhaps as the finale of a pleasure cruise along the Erie Canal, perhaps from a port of call elsewhere on the Great Lakes. If you're one of them, and you're in the market for some new gear for your boat, Obersheimer's Sailor Supply is the place for you. Since 1970, owner and namesake Charlie Obersheimer has stocked a full range of marine supplies and accessories in this huge chandlery in the heart of Black Rock. Sailboat rigging is a specialty here — the upper level of this cavernous edifice is given over to a full sail loft where expert technicians happily fit out, sew or repair sails with spars up to 65 feet (20 m). Goods such as halyards, furlers and adjusters are sold for reasonable prices, ropes and wires are spliced, and knowledgeable staff are always on hand to give advice. Obersheimer's doesn't leave powerboaters out in the cold either — outboard motors representing a range of brands are sold and serviced, with a particular emphasis on Nissan and Tohatsu models, as well as a range of parts and accessories."
"It's a shame that Riverside Fabric Center's limited hours scare off a lot of would-be customers, because the quality of the goods sold here — especially the lace — is worth going out of your way for. If you're in the market for fabrics, various and sundry sewing supplies, or to have a dress or other piece custom-made for you, you can scarcely do better. The incredibly friendly staff, helmed by owner Lena Harnish, is the icing on the cake."
"Ed Taublieb is the man who holds court every Saturday at the String Shoppe, the music store of choice for Black Rock and Riverside that specializes in a full range of quality new and used guitars and other string instruments to fit all budgets, and is an authorized dealer in Martin and Taylor guitars and Hohner harmonicas. An aficionado of the local folk scene in the '60s who fell into the business after buying and repairing his own used guitars to play at '''The Lime Light''', '''The Lower Level''', and other storied Buffalo venues of bygone days, Ed's been in business for almost half a century now — and he's still the String Shoppe's owner and sole employee. You're never going to get the kind of sincere personal attention you get here at a big chain like '''Guitar Center''' — not only does Taublieb personally inspect and adjust every instrument prior to sale, but he's always on hand to guide customers through his ample inventory and draw on his encyclopedic knowledge of his craft to help them through the selection process. Taublieb will also proudly repair or restring your guitar or other instrument. Aside from the aforementioned range of instruments, the String Shoppe stocks guitar cases, accessories such as strings, picks, straps, and pearl inlays, amps and pedals, and a modest range of books and sheet music."
"Since 1990, this unpretentious hangout at the corner of Grant and Ferry has served up ""The Flavor of Old Times"", with reasonably-priced Greek and American fare and renowned fish fry ever Friday. Albert's is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and boasts a lively full bar where beer and cocktails are served."
"Boomerang's is so named because ""the food's so good, you'll keep coming back"" — and it must be true, because Buffalonians really love this place. In an ambience that is relaxed and welcoming despite its spartan decor is served an extensive range of delicious cuisine that comes in portions that are huge and prices that aren't. The menu is eclectic, if unadventurous: the slate of main courses is slightly skewed toward Italian food, with a wide range of pasta dishes on offer as well as chicken entrées served in marsala, florentine, parmigiana and cacciatore styles. This is not to deprecate the wide range of other items on Boomerang's menu: beef Stroganoff, BBQ spare ribs, and a variety of sandwiches and burgers all make an appearance. Worthy of special mention are several interesting takes on porkchops — the raspberry porkchops with crumbly blue cheese has been described as an interesting combination of flavors that, perhaps surprisingly, harmonizes well. Diners also heap special praise on the appetizers here: ""you don't really know corn chowder until you've had this"", says one reviewer about Boomerang's most popular soup. A kids' menu is also available. It should be said, however, that the service is this place's Achilles heel: it's not so much bad as inconsistent, ranging wildly from warm and friendly to bitter and sarcastic."
"This new restaurant opened in late 2014 in an enormous, beautifully restored former Oddfellows Hall which was most recently used as the '''Mount Major Banquet Hall''' (true to that former identity, they still host banquets and other special events here of up to 100 people). La Gourmet Empanadas does indeed serve the titular South American specialty, in savory versions stuffed with chicken, pulled pork, beef, or salmon, vegetarian options with black beans, as well as dessert empanadas with fruit fillings. Aside from that, though, visitors may find the name a bit deceiving: the rest of the menu reads like that of a neighborhood pizzeria, with a fairly mundane (if perfectly well-executed) range of offerings comprised of pizza and wings, hot and cold subs, burgers, chicken fingers and other simple fare, as well as barbeque ribs. But by far the most interesting — not to mention surprising — non-empanada option on the menu is Hawaiian-style ''huli-huli'' rotisserie, available in either chicken or pork."
"One of a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's is a Venezuelan sandwich shop that opened in December 2015 at the former location of '''Rascal's''', on an up-and-coming stretch of Niagara Street. Venezuelan food is the name of the game here: owner Joel Perez is a recently arrived immigrant who came to Buffalo from his former home in Aragua State, and he's already turning heads among the West Side's increasingly numerous foodie community. The specialty here is ''arepas'', flatbread sandwiches that are a popular breakfast food in Colombia and Venezuela. Rancho's serves theirs not only at breakfast time but all day long; the naturally gluten-free corn flour in the bread is fried to a crisp and stuffed with your choice of rotisserie beef, shredded beef, chicken, or roast pork. Those who've travelled to Venezuela and experienced the cuisine on its home turf say they can't tell the difference. The menu doesn't stop there, though — hearty appetizers and side dishes include baked ''yuca'' drizzled in delicious avocado salsa, ''patacón pisao'' (shredded beef sliders with mashed fried plantain fritters as ""bread""), and ''tequeños'' (sort of a South American take on mozzarella sticks: fried ''queso blanco'' with garlic and herb salsa for dipping). As well, available on weekends only is what may be the greatest selection on the menu: ''sancocho'', a hearty chicken and beef soup thickened with potatoes and cassava, sweetened a little with corn on the cob, and seasoned with fresh cilantro; Venezuelan comfort food ''par excellence''. Rancho's prices are extremely reasonable, with nothing on the menu over $10, and Perez and his staff seem eager to convert curious first-time visitors into loyal repeat customers — this means expect super friendly and attentive service, and maybe a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your order."
"A relic from the days when the West Side was Buffalo's ""Little Italy"", hearty family-style Italian meals have been served at Santasiero's for almost a century now. The Italian wedding soup is spectacular, and sandwiches and dishes such as chicken parmigiana are available, but Santasiero's is most famous for the heaping portions of pasta they serve along with legendary red sauce. Reasonable prices, too."
"Since 2007, Prish Moran has operated her friendly old-world coffee shop in this beautiful and historic old Victorian building on Grant Street. The opening of Sweetness 7 is largely the reason why the Grant-Ferry area has been as trendy and up-and-coming as it has been for the past few years. Popular with artists, hipsters, and Buffalo State College students, Sweetness 7 serves fresh gourmet sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza, and pastry along with the coffee, and their breakfast is also very popular with locals."
"The West Side Bazaar's '''International Kitchen''' is the center of the universe for local fans of exotic international flavors: its food stalls serve a dizzying range of international cuisines — including some (such as South Sudanese and Rakhine) that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo — and at unbeatable prices to boot. Best of all, the food here is as authentic as it gets; by and large, the Bazaar's customer base are immigrants and refugees like those who work there, so you won't be disappointed by watered-down, Americanized versions of your favorite ethnic fare."
"Abyssinia is Buffalo's fourth and newest Ethiopian restaurant — and, according to a growing consensus, its best. Helmed by owner Zelalem Gemmeda, an Ethiopian native who's lived in Buffalo since 2006, Abyssinia's menu is divided about evenly between meat-based and vegetarian dishes and populated by all the standard Ethiopian favorites — ''doro watt'', beef and lamb ''tibs'', ''kitfo'', ''alitcha'', and so forth. Also, like its competition, those who can't decide or aren't familiar with the cuisine can order combo platters: either a mixture of meat and vegetarian dishes or all vegetarian, for $9.99 and $8.99 respectively. However, what sets Abyssinia apart is the authenticity of the recipes — complex, nuanced and intoxicating flavors that, unlike many of Buffalo's other Ethiopian restaurants, don't skimp on the spice (this is especially true of the vegetarian dishes). The ''sambusa'' are so good you won't mind that they skimp on the chutney. Recently, Abyssinia's menu has expanded to include pasta with marinara sauce, as well as a few Arabian specialties such as ''foul'' and chicken ''biryani'', available on Sundays and Mondays only. Perhaps this place's only weakness is the ''injera'': they skimp on that too (though you can ask for extra at no charge), and it lacks that slight vinegary tang."
"Thanks to 007 Chinese Food, in the words of one reviewer, ""it's a happy day — dumplings are back at the West Side Bazaar!"" Indeed, despite the multicultural vibrancy of the restaurants that have come and gone from the International Kitchen in the years since '''Jolie's Traditional Chinese Food''' moved to the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the Lower West Side, it's always seemed to many like there's been something missing. Enter Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' and other delectable little Chinese appetizers whose recipes he perfected at the restaurant he and his family ran in Malaysia before coming to Buffalo. The stars of the show on 007's modest-sized menu are the ''lo mai fan'' (balls of sticky rice mixed with stir-fried chicken and mushrooms, with sriracha sauce on the side for dipping), and of course, the steamed ''shu mai'' stuffed with your choice of beef, chicken, or vegetables. You probably won't be able to make a full meal out of any of these items, but they work spectacularly as appetizers to accompany a main course from one of the Bazaar's other food vendors — whatever you order here, be assured it's prepared fresh by hand in front of you and bursting with flavor (the exception being the ''pau'', which, even more than usual with Chinese steamed buns, tend toward the dry and doughy.) Complimentary hot tea is served with any order on request. Service at 007 is as friendly as can be, but often complicated by a language barrier — Maung's wife, who you'll often see running the restaurant, speaks very little English; if you have more complex questions or comments, you should seek out her husband or son, who are fluent."
"It's perhaps a testament to the singular nature of the West Side Bazaar that Family Thai is its least ""exotic"" dining option. Served here at the International Kitchen's newest restaurant are an impressive variety of Thai dishes such as ''pad thai'', ''pad see ew'', ''yum'' salads, and various curries in sizable portions. The emphasis here is on authenticity, and though service tends to be slow, it's worth the wait: one reviewer described the fare at Family Thai as ""light-years ahead of the other [Thai] eateries in town""."
"Co-owners New Phanthady and Boulivone Serixay have taken the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''A&A Cookies''' to the next level. Yes, you can still find ''dok jok'' here — the confection that endeared this booth to legions of West Side Bazaar regulars; a light, crispy, and sublimely delicious cookie of thin, coconut milk-infused dough folded in a lotus blossom shape — along with all the other pastries and snacks as before, and the bubble tea too. But now they also serve a selection of main courses from their native Laos; a modest range of noodle salads, stir-fried meat salads, soups, and samosas that make up in fresh, delicious flavor what they lack in portion size. Also, as if to make up for a weak point in most of the International Kitchen's other food stalls, a full range of bottled soft drinks is also available."
"In 2015, the owner of the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''Exotic Japanese Crepes''' moved across the corridor from his small freestanding stall to a much larger window in the '''International Kitchen''', and with that expanded space came an expanded menu of delicious food. Thus was the birth of M Asian Halal Foods. The crepes remain — a bit of a misnomer as they don't come from Japan, these thin, crispy pancakes with sweet or savory toppings were invented in Thailand and inscrutably dubbed ""Japanese"", an object lesson in the cross-pollination of Asian culinary traditions — but are now accompanied by a full range of 100% halal Indian and Pakistani specialties. The bulk of the menu is a fairly run-of-the-mill roster of butter chicken, pakora, biryani, vegetarian and nonvegetarian samosas, and tandoori chicken, but M Asian's menu also boasts a few more offbeat items like ''chapli'' (savory patties of Indian-spiced ground chicken that come with a small salad on the side), and South Indian cuisine is represented by a fairly ample selection of ''dosas'' topped with coconut chutney and your choice of vegetarian or goat curry. Food is reliable but not outstanding in quality, but the reasonable prices and service with a smile make M Asian worthwhile."
"2016 was a banner year for the West Side Bazaar's resident purveyor of Burmese cuisine, as the torch was passed to a new generation of the Soe family, and the former '''Kyel Sein Hein''' was rechristened Pwint War. Along with the new name came a new menu that takes the prize as the most authentic in Buffalo: eschewing the Thai fare that sometimes makes up the majority of the menu at other so-called ""Burmese"" restaurants in the area, almost every one of the huge range of tasty specialties served up at Pwint War are made with recipes native to Myanmar, with the sole exception of a superlative ''yum nua'' wherein a touch of sweetness offsets the fire of the chilis and the tang of the lime juice. Also served are what are easily the most authentic Burmese curries to be found in Buffalo (your choice of beef, chicken, pork belly, goat, grilled fish, or fish cakes; opt for a side of white rice for $2 extra), a seemingly endless variety of fried rice and noodle dishes, a Burmese take on ''biryani'' with your choice of meat, as well as a few holdovers from the old Kyel Sein Hein menu such as tomato salad and Shan noodles — and yes, these days you can even get ''le peth thoat'' (pickled tea leaf salad) at the Bazaar! The only unfortunate casualty of the changeover was the dropping of ''mohinga'' from the regular menu, though it still reappears as a daily special from time to time. Prices have gone up a little bit, but so has the quality of the food, and you get the same friendly service as always."
"This place's menu is an interesting juxtaposition: 30 varieties of sushi accompany a range of options native to Myanmar's Rakhine State. The sushi made by owner Khaing Thein is not particularly inspiring, though it is fresh and tasty. Options include a ""Buffalo roll"" with cream cheese, crab salad, and cucumber, as well as the mango banana roll, probably the place's most popular, which is prepared with fish sauce for a bit of extra spice. In fact, ""a bit of spice"" is an excellent summation of the main non-sushi item on the menu: the ''rakhaing mutee'', a variation of classic Burmese ''mohinga'' particular to Rakhine State, though Rakhapura's version substitutes chicken broth for the usual base of conger eel. It's a hearty, healthy, and indescribably delicious soup; a garlicky, slightly tangy broth with rice vermicelli and coriander, served with dried, crushed red chilis on the side if you want a bit more heat. Perhaps the best part of Rakhapura, however, is the owner: a longtime pro-democracy agitator, Thein escaped Myanmar with his life in 1996 and now spends his off hours lecturing around the area on the political and human rights situation in his homeland, which often makes for interesting conversations with customers!"
"Freddy J's may be a tiny little place, but a tsunami of flavor is packed inside these walls. In these cramped digs — about a half-dozen bar stools and a few outdoor tables in season are all the place holds — supremely friendly chef Fred Daniel, a native of Liberia who now hosts the local cable-access cooking show ''Late Night Noise'', cooks up what some describe as the best barbeque in Buffalo. The recipes, cooked with fresh ingredients sourced as often as possible from local neighbors like '''Guercio's''' and the '''West Side Bazaar''', are as authentic and time-tested as it gets, yet Freddy J's also manages to incorporate subtle Cajun and Caribbean influences into their dishes — witness the jerk chicken and fish, whose subtle but noticeable heat is assuaged by sides of yellow rice and ""Honey Hush cornbread"". The wings and ribs are slathered with just the right amount of sauce, and the fried haddock, served with mac & cheese, green beans, and (once again) cornbread, is a serviceable Southern-style approximation of classic Buffalo fish fry. Brunch is served Sunday mornings and afternoons till 3PM with bottomless mimosas."
"Don't be confused by the red neon sign in the window that says ""PSYCHIC READINGS"" — this isn't that kind of gypsy parlor! Owned by Gabrielle Mattina and named and themed in an homage to her Roma ancestry, this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor serves delicious food in an ambience that's airy yet intimate (reservations are recommended on weekends), comfortable yet garishly decorated. The bulk of the small menu is made up of light fare such as salads and sandwiches; most interestingly, a selection of appetizers dubbed ""West Side Delicacies"" are offered in a nod to the neighborhood's cultural diversity, and the ''pastelillos'', samosas and Burmese spring rolls hold their own with anything that's available at the '''West Side Bazaar'''. Really, you won't find anything more substantial at the Gypsy Parlor than the pair of half-pound burgers that are among the most popular items on the menu — either ""Classic American"" or ""Black Sheep"", the latter a decidedly upscale concoction of peppercorn-crusted ground lamb topped with a dijon & beet coleslaw. What you ''will'' find here is friendly, attentive service and food at a decent price."
"Nowadays, chef Marco Sciotino is probably more famous around these parts for helming the growing lineup of '''Marco's Italian Deli''' locations, but this cozy old place on Niagara Street is where it all began in 1988, when he purchased the erstwhile '''Darone's Fargo Grille''' and adorned it with his own name. The restaurant still has the no-frills ambience of a humble neighborhood bar, and fans of hearty, homestyle red-sauce Italian fare won't find anything unexpected on the menu, but don't let that fool you — this is creatively conceived, artfully executed food (even though the bread and herbed olive oil still comes off as a bit of an affectation) served in copious amounts for fair prices. All the usual suspects can be found on the menu — starters of antipasto salad, pasta fagioli, fava beans, and stuffed banana peppers, veal and chicken served in marsala, parmigiana, piccata and florentine styles, pasta dishes such as pomodoro and linguine with clam sauce — but fans of spice might want to try the ""Paesano Inferno"", a fiery delight of hot Italian fennel sausage and sautéed hot peppers served over penne pasta."
"The East Side's '''Pho 99''' introduced Buffalonians to Vietnamese cuisine when it opened in 1999, and though many restaurants and noodle shops have come and gone since then, it was not for fifteen years that the supremacy of their food was seriously challenged on the local level. The new kid on the block is the oddly named Pho Dollar, which not only serves incredibly delicious food — intoxicating interpretations of the trademark flavors of Southeast Asia — but boasts far more interesting and creative options on its extensive menu than 99 or any other place in Buffalo. Diners will strain to read the small-print English translations on the menu options, but those who do will be dazzled by a wide range of Vietnamese specialties (along with a small sampling of Cambodian and Thai items) including Buffalo's widest selection of ''pho'' (almost but not quite as good as 99's), a range of other soups, ''bun'' vermicelli bowls, stir-fried rice and noodle dishes, as well as heartier entrees. The appetizer section features not only the usual spring rolls and pot stickers, but a slate of to-die-for ''banh mi'' sandwiches. This delicious ambrosia is served up in an ambience that is sleek if not exactly minimalist (it's a much larger and more upscale place than it looks like from the street!) by servers that are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Best of all, Pho Dollar is open late, and a liquor license is forthcoming."
"Rajinder and Sujata Chauhan, erstwhile owners of the similar but much smaller '''Lincoln Park Market''' in Tonawanda, purchased in December 2012 the 900-square-foot (830 m²) former home of '''Aaron's Rent-to-Own''' on Grant Street, opening this international supermarket named after their young daughter. An immigrant-run business rife with ambition, Vineeta International Foods is a one-stop shop for unusual and exotic foods and merchandise you won't find anywhere else in the city. Let there be no understatement: this is ''the'' place to come for an all-encompassing range of imported groceries from the Indian subcontinent, East and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, including spices, curries and chutneys, fresh vegetables, frozen foods, packaged groceries, an impressive line of Goya products, a butcher section including a modest range of halal meats, as well as housewares, bath and beauty supplies, and the like. Munch on some of Mrs. Chauhan's delicious samosas — some say they're the best in the city — while you shop. Vineeta's sole sticking point is the produce section, which as often as not consists of an uninspiring range of past-their-prime vegetables, but things seem to be improving on this front lately."
"Usually at a restaurant the condiments are little more than an afterthought, but at Hot Mama's Canteen they're the ''raison d'être'': this brand-new dining destination in Grant-Amherst was conceived by co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") as a showcase for '''Headstone Heat''' hot sauces, which she owns and whose company headquarters share space with the restaurant in a Civil War-era brick house at the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road that once housed the venerable old '''Hilliker's Pastime''' bar. The menu is short and to the point, and the food on it — described in a recent ''Buffalo Rising'' article as ""comfort food with a twist... familiar, but just different enough for you to think about why you had never thought to do that before"" — consists of simple favorites like homemade sandwiches and burgers, heartier mains such as meatloaf dinners, appetizers such as salads and massive softball-sized arancini, and even breakfast fare, each expertly paired with a fiery Headstone Heat sauce to accentuate the delicious flavors. Also, this place serves the most delectable homemade, hand-cut fries you've ever tasted, and the bar features not only a great selection of beers on tap but also a fully restored vintage shuffleboard table. Meli and co-owner Jeff Davis bring a funky Allentown-type vibe to this place — they're alumni of '''Nietzsche's''' and '''Allen Street Hardware Café''', respectively — for an overall effect that is ""a throwback to the old muscle car and pinup days"", according to one reviewer: friendly, efficient service with a heaping side of charming sass."
"Much like its namesake (a 3.2 million-year-old ''australopithecus'' discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at that time the most complete specimen of a prehistoric human ancestor ever found), Lucy is a pioneer — local foodies' prayers were answered in early 2012 when Abba Biyan and Naima Tesfu established Buffalo's first Ethiopian restaurant, serving a cuisine whose absence on the Niagara Frontier had long been noted. It was worth the wait: though three more Ethiopian places have since opened their doors, Lucy is still the hands-down favorite; according to out-of-towners, Lucy serves among the best Ethiopian food you can get anywhere in the country. Visitors are quick to forgive the crowded dining room, no-frills decor, and sometimes inattentive service (an inevitable side effect of this tiny place's popularity) to feast on huge portions of traditional dishes such as ''doro watt'', ''tibs'' and ''sambusa'' that come packed with flavor, perfectly spiced, and served with plenty of injera — a flat, spongy bread used in place of silverware to scoop the food into one's mouth. Many options are available for vegetarians and vegans, and unique among its competitors, a full slate of Ethiopian breakfast options are offered (go for the $9.99 ""Lucy Special"" for a sampler of four breakfast items of your choice). Wash it all down with some of the most delicious sweet chai Buffalo has to offer, but perhaps more interestingly, on Saturday evenings from 3PM-7PM a free traditional coffee ceremony is held."
"Described in the pages of the ''Buffalo News'' as ""an institution on Amherst Street"", Nick's Place was actually located for its first five years on Elmwood Avenue in Park Meadow, where it was founded in 1994 by Greek immigrant Peter Ananiadis. Open daily for breakfast and lunch, what sets Nick's apart are little homestyle touches like the delicious homemade bread baked daily, as well as its Texas sauce which is used not on hot dogs (as is customary in Buffalo) but as a topping for some of the omelettes that dominate the breakfast menu. These are huge and uniformly delicious, with items like feta cheese, souvlaki and gyro meat available alongside the usual ingredients as part of the ""create your own omelette"" option. Lunch is characterized by the usual Greek diner fare such as open souvlaki and gyro, with burgers, wraps and club sandwiches rounding out the selections. Portions are huge and prices aren't, and a full kids' menu is available."
"The Dapper Goose filled a longstanding void in the Amherst Street dining scene when it opened in September 2016 in the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar''' — and it did so with aplomb; the place began racking up accolades from satisfied customers and reviewers in the national (!) and local press almost from opening day. The man behind it all is Keith Raimondi, an Olean native who built his reputation at a series of increasingly trendy culinary hotspots in Philadelphia before returning to his old stomping grounds to pull off his crowning achievement. He certainly had big shoes to fill — Mark Goldman, his predecessor in this space, is a local legend — and true to form, the old BRKB has been extensively reimagined in a style described by ''Step Out Buffalo'' as a ""turn-of-the-century supper club feel"", but which Raimondi and his staff prefer to call ""classic French cottage"": the walls are painted with pastel tones, giving a pleasant airy feel to the dining room that's perfect for the rustic wood of the furnishings and huge bar. Speaking of, it's the bar that has earned the Dapper Goose most of its hype thus far — served is a modest but carefully selected range of creative cocktails with a highlight on locally produced craft spirits from the likes of '''Lockhouse Distillery''' and '''Tommyrotter''', as well as an impressive wine list founded on European (especially French) vintages and a respectable selection of beer and cider too. But regardless of what the reviewers say, Raimondi wholeheartedly rejects any notion that the food cooked up by head chef Peggy Wong is merely an afterthought to the bar. Similar to the drink menu, the food menu is small in size but well-curated, and focused on the very best of what local producers have to offer. This is ""New American cuisine"" at its best, drawing from a diversity of influences including Continental, Asian, and (especially) Latin American flares to craft a range of dishes that are among the most creative and well thought out you'll find anywhere in Buffalo. Small plates abound — favorites include an appetizer of crispy golden-fried cauliflower drizzled in a dill-rich ""Green Goddess"" dressing, as well as a snapper served in a ceviche with coconut broth and hot peppers (deliciously fresh and not as daunting as it sounds for those who can't handle spice) — but easily the most popular item on the menu is the sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken: a huge bone-in thigh, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, served on a bed of kimchi fried rice and spicy pickled cucumbers whose sharp taste is the perfect offset. Fresh seasonal produce abounds, as do ample options for vegetarians — and best of all, you won't break the bank on the bill that comes at the end of the meal. Brunch coming soon."
"The name ""The Phoenix"" is apropos on several levels: it pays homage to the resurgent neighborhood in which it's located, as well as to the building itself, a former working-class gin mill that was extensively renovated by owner Mary Logue after a devastating fire (preservationists rejoice: the original brass-railed bar, hardwood flooring and tin ceiling were saved and are still in place, and the exterior is bedecked by an unmissable metal sign, locally crafted just down the road at '''Atlas Steel'''). Opened in March 2013, this ""American Tavern"" is a place for simple but delectably-prepared food served in an ambience that is a pleasant blend of classy and casual. The menu betrays diverse influences — from Polish (lazy pierogi and kielbasa, one of the Phoenix's most popular main courses) to Belgian (steak frites) to South American (flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce) — augmented by a modest but expertly curated selection of wines and specialty cocktails that really attest to this place's upscale touch. A decent selection of bottled local and regional craft brews is available as well. Best of all, diners rave about the dedication displayed by the waitstaff, as well as Logue herself, who can often be seen working the hostess stand and ensuring with sincere concern that each guest leaves satisfied. Reservations are highly recommended for Friday and Saturday nights especially; in warm weather, try for a table on the patio out back, whose pleasant coziness is an extension of the dining room's."
"Located in the shadow of the gargantuan '''Connecticut Street Armory''' (hence its name), this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, is a throwback to the olden days of the West Side as Buffalo's Little Italy. The order of the day at the Armory Restaurant is simple, homestyle Italian, hearty and delicious. Interestingly, there is no set menu here — the offerings consist solely of a changing slate of daily specials, of which there are about eight or nine at any given time. Favorites include the lentil soup, a sausage sandwich made with spicy '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and a concoction known as ""The Brick"": an ample portion of baked ziti that features a blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses as well as the most mouth-watering red sauce you've ever tasted. The Armory has been a favorite meeting place and lunchtime hangout for Buffalo politicians since the 1960s, when the West Side's own Frank Sedita served as mayor. Political bigwigs aren't the only folks you'll see there, though; the place also has a loyal following among D'Youville College's student body (likely because of the prices, which are a remarkable value for what you get). The ambience is friendly and without a hint of pretension, and the service is remarkably quick."
"BreadHive was launched by local trio Emily Stewart, Allison Ewing and Tori Kuper, who adapted the philosophy of the '''Nickel City Housing Co-op''' — of which all three are former residents — to the concept of an artisanal bakery: the business is cooperatively owned by all its employees and selflessly gives back to the community that supports it through the ""bread-share"" program they've dubbed ""the Crust Belt"". As before, bagels remain BreadHive's best-known specialty, and they're out of this world — house-made the traditional way with locally-grown organic flour and wild yeast, deliciously hefty, and available in eight flavors slathered generously with goat cheese — and they still offer fresh-baked breads like the flagship ""West Side Sourdough"", multigrain, deli rye and Danish-style ''rugbrød'', as well as soft pretzels, pastry, and homemade granola. But with the new location has come an expanded concept, and at lunchtime BreadHive serves a slate of delicious sandwiches all named for the owners' favorite female musicians — favorites include ""The Robyn"" (basically a Reuben, except with pastrami in place of corned beef; the beet caraway sauerkraut is sourced from the West Side's own '''Barrel + Brine''') and ""The Bjork"" (a vegan-friendly concoction with tempeh ""bacon"" that really intrigued the reviewer in a recent edition of ''Buffalo Rising''). A somewhat smaller range of breakfast sandwiches are available in the morning as well, with locally-produced '''Public Coffee''' to wash them down. All these goodies are served to you either in a brightly-colored, well-lit dining room (the decor was described in a ''New York Times'' feature as ""psychedelic country house by way of Bushwick"" and by owner Emily Stewart herself as ""upscale '''Cracker Barrel'''"") where you can chill out to the strains of the latest indie music, or else on a small sidewalk patio perfect for people-watching."
"Once upon a time, hot dogs at '''Ted's''' followed by delicious soft-serve at Custard Corner was the classic West Side waterfront double-shot. Though Ted's Porter Avenue location closed in the '90s, its counterpart still hops during the summer months — and as if to make up for the loss of Ted's, Custard Corner's menu has expanded to include hot dogs, burgers, fries, chicken fingers, and other summery fare, including a decent range of salads. That's all well and good, but the standout here remains the changing selection of hard and soft '''Perry's''' ice cream (try the sponge candy flavor for a true taste of Buffalo!) that comes in cones, sundaes, or as part of an ""Arctic Swirl"" — their knockoff version of '''Dairy Queen''''s ""Blizzard"". Milkshakes, Italian ices, and frozen yogurt are also offered. There's nothing better on a summer day in Buffalo than relaxing here with a sweet treat on an umbrella-shaded picnic bench and taking in the pleasant view across the street to '''Prospect Park'''."
"Five Points' favorite hipster watering hole, now serving a full menu of pub grub. Barbeque is the specialty of the house at the Essex Street Pub: Texas- and Memphis-style platters of brisket, pulled pork and ribs served with cornbread, coleslaw, baked beans, or mac & cheese draw Buffalonians from far and wide. The meat is smoked in-house — slowly over hickory, the old-fashioned way — and they even make their own pastrami and corned beef (try their ""PLT"" which replaces bacon with delicious homemade pastrami). Elsewhere on the menu, diners can choose from a range of burgers and sandwiches, salads, as well as ample portions of ""snackatizers"" featuring some of the finest BBQ wings Buffalo has to offer, with just the right amount of sauce to accentuate but not overwhelm the smoky flavor of the chicken. Downsides include the service, which can be slow and gruff; also, no one would call this place the most comfortable in the world (seating is at the bar on high stools, or at one of the few wobbly tables if they're free)."
"Generous portions of delicious Puerto Rican specialties served up for a pittance in a genial, family-oriented atmosphere: that's the name of the game at La Flor. This combination restaurant/bakery boasts a menu that's small, but packs in a respectable range of tropical fare. Those in search of a light lunch or a quick snack can enjoy sandwiches that range from familiar standards like turkey and ham and cheese to Hispano-Caribbean selections such as their excellent Cubano, as well as deep-fried classics like ''alcapurrias'' (described by many as the best in Buffalo), ''tostones'', and ''yuca al ajillo''. On the other side of the spectrum, heartier entrees — ''pollo guisado'', ''pollo frito'', ''pernil'', and the daily specials that make up the true heart and soul of La Flor's delicious cuisine — are served with heaping sides of yellow rice and beans. No matter what you order here, you can be sure that it's absolutely delicious and served with a smile. Wash it all down with a cold bottle of malta or kola champagne, and don't forget to take home some of the delectable tropical desserts available in the bakery: ''bizcocho'', several varieties of flan, ''pastelillos'', and on and on."
"When local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz closed the doors of his namesake fine dining destination, '''Martin Cooks''', to embark on his next culinary adventure, '''Horsefeathers Market''' was left with a big expanse of space to fill — much bigger than its next tenant, '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile''', was accustomed to. What to do with the excess? Owner Jill Gedra-Forster had done a brisk business selling sandwiches and other light snacks at the old location on Elmwood Avenue, so the natural answer was to expand her operations into a full-fledged restaurant. Thus — with Will Peterson, former head chef of '''The Black Sheep''', the upscale foodie haven a little further down Connecticut Street that's co-owned by Gedra-Forster's sister, on board — was born Lait Cru Brasserie in August 2016. The fine domestic and imported cheeses Nickel City Cheese still sells the next stall over figure prominently into the gourmet breakfast and lunch fare served at Lait Cru (try the cheese plate if you want to go this route: it comes with a changing selection of three cheeses plus crunchy fried fava beans, wine-poached apricots, and — optionally — luxurious, 600-day aged prosciutto), but this place is no one-trick pony: a range of other locally-sourced goodies from Buffalo-area urban farms like '''Groundwork Market Garden''' and artisanal producers like the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''' are amply employed in the selection of sandwiches and other fare. Whether it's the ever-popular ""Nic Mac"" sandwich (house-roasted beef with crunchy sweet pickles and a tangy special sauce) that's caught your eye, or the house-cured salmon on German-style ''vollkornbrot'', or perhaps a selection from the all-day breakfast menu (standard egg, cheese, and meat concoctions enhanced with gourmet ingredients and well-thought-out presentations), you can be assured of fresh, well-balanced flavors, with full advantage taken of seasonal produce. Portions are on the small side and prices are on the high side, but — it bears repeating again — the quality of the ingredients justifies that. You can dine at one of the half-dozen or so tables scattered sparsely across the hardwood floor, but most people seem to opt for a seat at the long, low bar that's a holdover from the Martin Cooks days, where you have a great view of the open kitchen. Dinner hours are forthcoming, so it's claimed, as is a liquor license."
"Occupying the space in the rear of '''Horsefeathers Market''' that was previously home to '''Blackbird Sweets''', this family-owned eatery is open five days a week for lunch and on Fridays and Saturdays also for dinner, when an expanded menu is on offer. Michelle's is distinct from most of Buffalo's other Caribbean restaurants in that the food they serve is not Jamaican in provenance but comes from Trinidad and Tobago, a country where classic Caribbean flavors are tempered by a diversity of culinary influences including Hispanic, African, Indian, and even Chinese. Accordingly, head chef Marlene Bernard's menu accommodates everything from well-known favorites like oxtail and escoveitch fish, to Trinidadian particularities such as ""doubles"" (a sandwich of fried flatbread stuffed with curried chickpeas) and ''dhalpuri roti'', to full-blown fusion dishes like ''pelau'' salad (which bears a resemblance to both the South Asian rice dish ''pulao'' and the ''jambalaya'' of Louisiana Creole cuisine) and ""Caribbean Chinese"" chicken, lightly breaded and served over fried rice and mixed vegetables — the folks at Michelle's call it ""morish"" food, because as soon as you finish what's on your plate, you want more. All this goodness is served up with a heaping side of laid-back island hospitality, as friendly as can be."
"Located on Niagara Street, the main thoroughfare of Buffalo's West Side Latino community, the Niagara Café has been recognized by ''Artvoice'' as Buffalo's best Puerto Rican restaurant. Latin American specialties like ''pastelillos'', ''alcapurrias'', ''pollo guisado'', and rice and beans are all available here in a friendly environment for prices that cannot be beat. This place has won multiple awards at the Taste of Buffalo. More than its food, however, the Niagara Café is about Puerto Rican cultural pride and community identity."
"A business defined by an ethos of ethics, sustainability, and health-consciousness, Press opened its doors in the Lower West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''', graduated to a stand-alone location on Grant Street in 2013, and most recently, in 2016, has landed in an even larger space in Five Points. The flagship product here is a range of organic juices that are all cold-pressed onsite (a method of extraction that preserves three times as many nutrients as others) and offered either on a made-to-order basis or packaged in returnable glass bottles so as to reduce plastic waste. As well, delicious smoothies, organic energy shots and drinks, and cold-filtered coffee are sold. Those who've arrived for lunch can enjoy an all-new, chainging selection of daily salad and sandwich specials — all organic, locally-sourced, vegan, and GMO-free — as well as vegan breakfast in the morning. Executive Chef Esther Pica is happy to work with customers to accommodate any dietary needs or preferences they may have, and all ingredients for each item are helpfully listed on the menu. As well, all utensils are biodegradable or reusable. Local consensus is this food is pricey but worth it."
"This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side is all business, dishing out Puerto Rican specialties among a spartan decor — this place's food is so good that they don't need to distract you with fancy-shmancy bells and whistles. ""I think the operative word to describe Sazón Criollo best may be 'simple'"", says one reviewer, but an equally good word might be ""authentic"" — unlike the '''Niagara Café''', Buffalonians at large haven't yet discovered this place, and with a customer base that's almost entirely Spanish-speaking and Latino, Sazón Crillo couldn't afford to serve anything less than the real deal. Step inside and place your order at the counter (most likely with one of the extremely friendly husband-and-wife team who owns the place), then take your seat from among the half-dozen or so tables in the small dining room, and when the time comes, dig in to a whole slew of Hispano-Caribbean selections, from well-known favorites like ''alcapurrias'', ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil'' to delicacies that are harder to find in Buffalo, like stewed ''mofongo'' served with a variety of meat toppings, as well as an awesome ''tripleta'' sandwich offered at lunchtime — a messy, meaty trifecta of ham, ''pernil'', and whole sautéed chicken breasts smothered with melted cheese, ketchup and mayonnaise and served on toasted panini. Daily specials are also offered which include a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes on Fridays, including ''bacalao guisado'' and a delectable seafood salad. The service at Sazón Criollo is brusque but efficient, and the prices can't be beat."
"Niagara Seafood began its life as a seafood shop owned by Michael Nguyen — who also owns '''Á Châu International Market''' next door — and was later converted to a restaurant, a gradual process that ended in 2014 when the last frozen seafood coolers and grocery displays were taken out of the dining room. A few Burmese and Thai dishes are to be had here, but the main attraction at Niagara Seafood is Vietnamese cuisine, with an accent, not surprisingly, on seafood. Steamed mussels, crab, shrimp, clams, oysters, crawfish, and even whole lobsters are the backbone of the menu, along with fried appetizers, fish sandwiches, and even a fairly faithful interpretation of Buffalo-style fish fry — its only major departure from local tradition is that catfish, lake perch and tilapia are offered as well as the usual haddock. The menu also boasts a number of non-seafood mains, but most of them are not as good; it's especially advisable to stay away from the chicken curry, which contains more bone than meat (those little bones that are hard to eat around, no less). Worthy of special mention is the ''pho'': in contrast with the ample selection of permutations available at '''Pho 99''', there's only one variety available at Niagara Seafood — ''pho bo gan'', with tendons and beef meatballs (thinly sliced filet mignon can be added for a $2 upcharge) — but it's among the most authentic you'll find in Buffalo. Sadly, the flavor and freshness of the broth leave much to be desired, but the same is not true of the ''banh mi'' available as appetizers, which were good enough to win Niagara Seafood the award for Best Sandwich in 2013's ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' poll in ''Artvoice''. Though portion sizes are generous, the food tends to be a bit pricey, so beware."
"In 2014, '''Bistro Europa''' joined the growing legion of businesses leaving the popular but high-rent Elmwood Village for the newly trendy West Side: owners Steve and Ellen Gedra set up shop in August of that year at the former '''Golden Key Tavern''' on Connecticut Street with a new name and a slightly revised concept. The newly rechristened Black Sheep builds on the pan-European eclecticism of its former iteration with a menu that, while not much longer than Bistro Europa's, is even more wide-ranging and upscale than before (with prices to match). This expansion is a reflection of the expansion of its staff, kitchen facilities, and above all, dining room: The Black Sheep seats about 70 people, more than double the old place, and the capacity is expanded further in the summer months thanks to a large, pleasant rear patio. As always, the accent here is on locally-sourced produce, meat, poultry, and dairy products, which figure into the smoked pork chop entree that comes with a side of heirloom grits and braised greens. As for appetizers, the cheese and charcuterie plates that were so popular at Europa are still on hand (courtesy of Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile'''), along with new innovations such as a sweet-and-savory watermelon gazpacho that comes with kaffir lime granita. You can also enjoy a selection of beers curated by '''Community Beer Works''' at a bar made of wood salvaged during the thorough restoration process that preceded the Black Sheep's opening."
"Left Bank has been the cornerstone of the Five Points dining scene since its opening in 1992. Despite its name and the local misconception, the menu here goes far beyond French food, instead encompassing an eclectic sampling of Continental, Italian, and New American dishes — in fact, Left Bank was one of the first restaurants in the city to embrace upscale cuisine of that kind, hence its enduring reputation as one of Buffalo's most celebrated fine dining destinations. As well, the menu has remained remarkably static over that time — some locals even call it ""dated"" — but when you serve food this consistently good, why fix what's not broken? With portions that are big especially for a fine-dining establishment like this, the menu consists of a modest but high-quality range of appetizers and salads, a selection of small plates divided into rustic ""peasant fare"" (featuring the best fried calamari in the city) and more upscale ""bourgeois fare"" (the ahi tuna tartare is a particular standout), and a slate of creative and artful main courses of steak and chops, seafood dishes such as an out-of-this-world carrot papardelle tossed in a shellfish brandy cream with lobster, shrimp and crab, and a range of pasta dishes including a delightful chicken linguine with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. Left Bank also offers a changing selection of daily specials, as well as a wine list of encyclopedic proportions and impeccable quality; those who'd prefer to eat light have several delicious focaccia sandwiches to choose from. All this is served in a chic, intimate ambience that's been described as ""arty meets industrial meets pub"". It bears emphasizing that this is a small place where reservations are ''de rigueur'' and it gets uncomfortably loud when crowded, so if it's warm, opt for the pleasant, gardenlike patio in back. Service can be slow, but it's always friendly; anyway, this is the kind of place where you want to linger. Off-street parking is available — a rarity in this part of town."
"The September 2013 opening of this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' and most recently occupied by '''Prime 490''' steakhouse, was decidedly quiet. But Providence Social is the real deal. At the helm is chef/owner Josh Hanzlian, whose local credibility is beyond reproach: his stepfather is the late, great Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Martin, and another branch of his family owns '''Hanzlian's Homemade Sausage''' in Pine Hill. Hanzlian describes the cuisine served at Providence Social as a ""new American fusion"" where the focus is on tapas and small plates (though a small range of full-size mains is also available), and in a recent write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'' said he ""want[s] this [restaurant] to be a social experience"", hence its name. The food here consists of tried-and-true favorites with creative twists: nachos are topped with duck confit and lime-infused crème fraîche, sliders are made with ground lamb and boast a salsa of cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds, and the stuffed poblano peppers — arguably the most popular item on the menu — are filled with a mélange of aged cheeses and stone-cut oats, crusted with an olive panko breading, and served at dinner with a red pepper chipotle cream sauce and at brunch on Sundays with a side of eggs and toast. Indeed, reviewers reserve special praise for the Sunday brunch here, with $1 mimosas on offer. Appropriately enough for the place that was once the scene of a Mafia hit, the ambience at Providence Social is pure gangland-era Art Deco, right down to the stylized lettering on the huge neon sign. The speakeasy decor continues indoors, complete with chandeliers, for a package that one reviewer describes as ""rival[ing] '''Left Bank''' in atmosphere both indoors and on the patio"" — yet it's refreshingly less crowded (for now) than that nearby hotspot. Service is friendly and attentive."
"Every Saturday morning during the winter months, the ground floor of '''Horsefeathers Market''' is transformed into a winter farmers' market where over twenty farmers and vendors from all across Western New York sell fresh produce and locally crafted artisanal food products — cookies, jams and jellies, even organic dog treats and local wine. Visitors can enjoy performances by local musicians as they browse the market stands, or enjoy a bite to eat after shopping at permanent Horsefeathers tenants like '''Michelle's Caribbean Cuisine'''."
"One of the best-kept secrets in Black Rock, Angie's Pizza House is a friendly neighborhood hole-in-the-wall that dishes out cheap, delicious pizza and homestyle Italian fare in a handsome old brick block on Niagara Street. In the words of one reviewer, ""like the City of No Illusions [itself], there's no pretense here""; rather, its dated, spartan decor combines with friendly service to create true humble, homespun charm. The titular focus of the menu has a crust that's a good deal thinner than classic Buffalo-style pizza (though not foldable like New York pizza), and the pepperoni are the large, thinly-sliced kind you don't see too often here, but the sauce has the same sweetness you'll find elsewhere in the area. Pizza is only the beginning of the story at Angie's, though: the regulars rave about simple but reliable Italian favorites like ravioli, eggplant parm, and (especially) spaghetti with homemade meatballs and red sauce, and there are also hot and cold subs, more elaborate fare like steaks and chops, and a surprisingly competent chicken souvlaki entree. Hearty breakfasts are served weekdays, and Friday fish fry packs the house. Cash only."
"Open for breakfast, lunch and (except Sunday) dinner, Emily's could be accurately described as a classic blue-collar Buffalo Greek diner, but that would be selling the place a bit short: for one, a small slate of Lebanese specialties including ''kofta'' over rice and homemade ''labneh'' are now served; and also, the food served here is a cut above what you'd expect from a humble place like this. This is a mom-and-pop place in the most literal sense of the term: Sam, the friendly, personable owner/chef who's frequently seen chatting up the regulars in the dining room, is joined on Emily's staff by his wife Jocelyn, the sole waitress whose service is second to none. In a delightfully dated ambience is served a host of hearty, homestyle American fare like meatloaf, liver and onions, and porkchops; sandwiches, burgers, and wraps (including that old-school Buffalo standby, fried bologna); and — of course — all your favorite Greek diner standards such as souvlaki and gyro, served either ""open"" or as full-size entrees with a side of potatoes prepared how you like them. Souvlaki permutations also populate the breakfast menu, which otherwise consists of hearty egg-and-sausage fare as well as delicious homemade pancakes. All the food is delicious, homemade, and served with old-fashioned aplomb. A public lot is conveniently located across the street as an alternative to parallel parking on Hertel Avenue."
"No surprises at this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014. There are a few token concessions to local particularities — Texas hots available alongside regular hot dogs; souvlaki chicken and feta cheese among the ingredient selections in the ""build-your-own"" omelette — but by and large, George's sticks to the tried-and-true formula of classic American diner fare and does so with aplomb. The burgers, sandwiches, and copious breakfast options are reliably good and available at great prices. Service is efficient, the interior is sparkling clean and decorated in a pleasant if spartan aesthetic — one online review of this place included the sentence ""If an alien visited Earth and asked 'what's a diner?' this is exactly where I would take them"", and that's about as accurate and succinct a review of George's as you'll ever find."
"Riverside Café is a friendly, homey greasy spoon (actually, that's probably not the right term to use — this place is spic and span!) in the heart of the neighborhood of the same name, serving breakfast and lunch daily with several changing specials available each day. ""Local"" is the operative word here — Riverside Café's lunch menu features a rogue's gallery of Buffalo specialties like beef on weck, Texas hots, and fried bologna sandwiches made with locally-produced '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters, '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and '''Costanzo's''' rolls. Sandwiches are king at lunchtime — the slate of single- and double-decker concoctions include a delectable Monte Cristo made with either turkey or corned beef — and some interesting burgers are available too, all made with 100% Angus beef patties; these include a ""Buffalo-style burger"" (topped with a mix of blue cheese dressing and '''Frank's''' hot sauce) and a doughnut burger (exactly what it sounds like: a glazed doughnut replaces the bun). A decent selection of homemade soups are also available to go with. But Riverside Café may be even more popular at breakfast, with a gargantuan menu that ranges from the usual permutations of the eggs-toast-sausage-bacon template to more specialized dishes like a pepperoni and salsa omelette and flaky homemade biscuits topped with sausage gravy. Additionally, the Riverside Café is open into dinnertime on Fridays and Saturdays, when locals pack the house to enjoy delicious fish fry — another local favorite. Service here earns mixed reviews; it's quick and efficient but sometimes not so friendly."
"In 2015, Acqua changed the game: that's when the waterfront eatery at the former site of '''Harry's Harbour Place'''  launched a new ""casual menu"", boasting lower prices and a more laid-back atmosphere to go with the breathtaking views over the Niagara River. Seafood rules the day among Acqua's main courses — not surprisingly — but the appetizer menu adds interesting Asian influences to the mix, including an interesting noodle bowl with shredded chicken and peanut sesame sauce."
"Buffalo Supper Club's owners, Aaron Osborne and Christopher Williams, started with a vision: what if the Black Rock dining scene were more than just pizzerias, fast-food joints and greasy spoons? What if, instead, you could come to the uppermost reaches of the West Side for a real night on the town, with fine dining at a stylish, upscale sit-down restaurant? Flash forward to October 2014, when the Buffalo Supper Club opened its doors on Niagara Street. The owners promised that ""when you walk in here, you won't think you're in Black Rock; you'll think you're somewhere on Delaware or Elmwood"", and despite its unassuming look from the outside, all is as promised — the dining room makes up for in style and snazz what it lakes in size, with a sleek, minimalist decor, all-black furniture (including a comfy ''chaise longue''!), an electric fireplace, a vintage-style jukebox, and a lively bar serving up a mix of big-name domestic and imported beers as well as local craft brews. Best of all, without skimping on quality, the Buffalo Supper Club's food comes at prices that won't break the bank: nothing on the menu costs more than $30. The food here scores few points for creativity; instead, it offers well-executed takes on familiar favorites such as steak, a range of chicken and seafood mains, classic Buffalo-style fish fry, burgers (the ""Supper Club Blues Burger"", featuring one beef and one chicken patty topped with bacon, American and crumbly blue cheese is a particularly interesting option), and on the appetizers menu, chicken wings that come in Buffalo style, barbeque or your choice of specialty sauces."
"A surprise is in store for hungry Black Rockers who peruse Faso's unassuming, shopworn exterior and expect yet another round of uninspired red-sauce Italian. It's true that this is a small family operation located in a blue-collar neighborhood, and from the prices on the menu you wouldn't think you're in for anything remarkable. But Faso's is run by a real Italian — ""actually from Italy, not an nth generation [Italian-American who doesn't] know any Italian except throwing 'paisan' into conversation"", says one reviewer — whose authentic food boasts nuanced flavors and textures not typical of Americanized Italian food. Start by walking into a dining room that's much larger than it looks from the outside and doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be highbrow or lowbrow — delightfully tawdry decorative elements like colored Christmas lights (up all year), dangly baubles, framed portraits of the Rat Pack, and plaster Virgin Mary sculptures coexist with low lighting and soft Italian music on the speakers. Then, while munching on the most heavenly bread knots that have ever melted in your mouth, peruse menu options that range from well-known standards to more obscure dishes that are hard to find in these parts; this ""food so good you'll think we stole your mama"" is light, healthful, and prepared with fresh ingredients. Faso's pasta is scratch-made in house, the ""best seafood menu on the Buffalo Harbor"" includes shrimp fra' diavolo, swordfish steak Italiano, and scallops cooked any way you like, fine steaks and chops abound, and sandwiches and the like are on offer for those who want portions smaller than the heaping ones you otherwise get. Service is uncommonly warm and friendly — the owner is known for greeting customers personally with an impeccable, old-world tableside manner — but can be slow if the place is crowded."
"Yet another addition to the roster of options on the West Side for fans of Burmese cuisine, this place is run by the same folks who operate '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street (and, in tandem with the December 2014 opening of the restaurant, they also inaugurated a second grocery store location next door). In reality, Thai dishes comprise more than half of the options on Lin Restaurant's menu: mostly the standard lineup of curries, fried rice, and noodle dishes available with chicken, beef, pork, or seafood, but with a few surprises mixed in if you look. However, it's in the Burmese options where Lin's cooks really strut their stuff in terms of creativity and authenticity: savory ''samosas'' are the star of the show in the appetizers department, ''le peth thoat'' tea leaf salad is present in a version that rivals the one at '''Sun''', and ''mohinga'' is made the authentic Burmese way. Copious options are available for vegans and the gluten-free crowd, but those who like spicy food might not be quite satisfied with the preparation here (for best results, have them make your food ""Thai hot""). Service is friendly as can be and carefully walks the line between attentive and annoyingly obtrusive, and the pleasant if minimalist decor looks as if a spartan selection of Asian restaurant accoutrements (silver elephant engravings and the like) were grafted onto the template of a homestyle country diner, with walls painted pink and covered with charming wainscoting around the bottom."
"The Buffalo dining scene has come a long way since 2010, when Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur, felt compelled to lump the delicious specialties of his native Myanmar under the ""Vietnamese"" section of his restaurant's menu because he was unsure how locals would take to this unfamiliar new cuisine. He needn't have worried — Buffalonians practically beat down the door at Sun, and even if this place can't hold a candle to the West Side Bazaar's '''Kyel Sein Hein''' in terms of authenticity, it's still the only game in town if you want a full menu of Burmese food served in an actual, full-service restaurant setting. The ""full menu"" part bears repeating — the range of offerings at Sun is gargantuan, with a menu broken down into Burmese (labeled as such), Thai, and Asian fusion sections featuring tantalizing appetizers and salads, curries, rice and noodle dishes, and soups. Diners also love Sun's ""black rice menu"", a range of sushi rolls, salads and desserts prepared using a rare and nutritious variety of rice once reserved for the elites of the Chinese imperial court — and although in this author's opinion it's way overhyped, locals rave about the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') which is Sun's specialty. For newbies, the helpful waitstaff are always happy to walk you through the menu, explaining each dish in detail. On the minus side, Sun's food is pricey especially when you consider the unimpressive size of their portions, and service is often slow especially when it's crowded."
"The Viking Lobster Company is a classic case of ""don't judge a book by its cover"": hidden inside a somewhat shabby-looking building that could pass for one of the houses on the side street next to it is arguably the finest restaurant in Black Rock. The menu here is modest in size, but covers all the bases for seafood lovers — shrimp, scallops, broiled salmon and haddock filets, king crab legs, and, of course, myriad permutations of lobster — and also makes room for a few interesting innovations, such as steak-stuffed lobster and a creative take on paella. Prices may seem high at first glance, but it's justified by the impeccable quality of the food — it's shipped directly from processors on the North Atlantic coast for maximum freshness, and Viking also has the largest live-lobster holding pens in Upstate New York. For those who don't like seafood, a modest range of steaks, ribs, and roasted chicken dishes are served; these also tend to be lower in price than the rest of the menu. Sides such as soups, salads and bread are all prepared daily in-house. At Viking, service is friendly and attentive, the vibe is relaxed, portion sizes are ample, and the interior is cool without trying to be — pretense is eschewed in favor of what one reviewer describes as a ""quirky at-the-wharf kind of feel"". In summer, the patio (which features a raw bar and outdoor grill) is the place to be. Reservations are required. Cash only, but there's an ATM onsite."
"The West Side's newest craft brewery boasts a German-style outdoor beer garden featuring homemade brews and light snacks, as well as bocce courts and a fire pit. In the winter, the operation moves indoors to an indoor tap room with ample views over the brewhouse."
"Organic cold-pressed juices and smoothies, as well as coffee."
"Laundry and dry cleaning."
"All Saints Catholic Church was founded by Bishop Charles Colton to serve the largely Irish population of the then-new neighborhood of Riverside. The present building — the third to house the congregation — is a handsome Colonial edifice dedicated in 1937 and home to a ""Mighty Wurlitzer"" organ donated by famous hotelier and local native son Ellsworth Statler. All Saints remains a robust congregation headed by longtime pastor Angelo Chimera."
"With the completion of the New York Central Railroad's Belt Line in 1883, the eastern outskirts of Black Rock began to develop into Buffalo's second Polish neighborhood — a sort of little brother to Broadway-Fillmore — and Assumption Church, headed at the outset by the Rev. Theophil Kozlowski, was its nucleus. The current church, a majestic ""Polish Cathedral style"" edifice built in 1914 to a design by the local firm of Schmill & Gould, is still a fairly active one of about 2,500 registered members."
"Located on the Upper West Side, Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is where the Reverend Peter Hai Nguyen says Mass to Buffalo's Vietnamese immigrant community."
"Located in Prospect Hill, Holy Angels is one of the oldest Catholic churches in Buffalo, founded in 1859 in what was then a middle-class Irish community on the outskirts of town by Bishop John Timon, in conjunction with several Oblate Fathers from Marseille. The addition in 1874 of the transept, sanctuary, and choir completed the building to its present appearance. Holy Angels has been a West Side anchor in the midst of the myriad changes that have taken place since then — neighborhood demographics have shifted from Irish to Italian to Hispanic (one Spanish-language Mass is still said every Sunday) to a multicultural pastiche, and the building is now an island in the middle of the greatly expanded '''D'Youville College''' — but the friendly and welcoming church community, 1,400 families strong, soldiers on."
"Holy Cross was founded in tandem with the growth of the Italian community in its surrounding neighborhood, and has managed to remain a vital cornerstone of the Lower West Side despite the great changes that have taken place there over the century of its existence. Holy Cross today is a congregation that is vibrant and multicultural, but largely Hispanic, and Mass is said in both languages. True to the Italian tradition, the interior of the church is bedecked with scores of statues of the Madonna, many of which were brought over by the original parishioners from the old country."
"Our Lady of Hope is the West Side's newest Catholic church, founded in 2009 as a merger of Annunciation (in whose handsome Gothic edifice the current congregation worships), Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and Our Lady of Loretto parishes. Here, with the help of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the Rev. Mitch Byeck ministers to a congregation that's ever-growing in size and diversity."
"The former '''First Hungarian Baptist Church''' — a humble yet handsome wood-frame building on Austin Street in Grant-Amherst erected in 1912 as one of the few surviving works of local architect John Coxhead — has been reborn as the home to an ""independent, fundamental, Bible-believing, soul-winning, compassionate gospel-preaching Baptist church"" where the imposing Pastor Pete Wigdor offers old-fashioned, plainspoken solutions to the real problems of modern-day people. Charity Baptist Church's dedication to community outreach is exemplified not only in the Sunday morning services where regulars and visitors alike are welcomed with open arms, but with programs such as a weekly ""Movie Night"", a community food pantry, and occasional special events."
"As its name indicates, First United Methodist is the oldest congregation of its denomination in Buffalo, and one of the oldest, period — it was founded in 1819 in what was then the Village of Black Rock by the Reverend Glezen Fillmore, an itinerant frontier preacher who, besides being a cousin of President Millard Fillmore, was New York State's first Methodist minister west of the Genesee River. They moved to their current location in 1912, where Pastor Scott Lamont Johnson continues to lead weekly services for a small but vibrant and welcoming flock. If nothing else, the building itself is reason enough to come: it's a handsome English Gothic design in rough-cut limestone that's the work of architect John Coxhead, with an austere but lovely skylit interior."
"With an innovative and community-based approach to ministry, Grace Community Church is a multiethnic Wesleyan congregation that seeks to ""put the neighbor back in the 'hood"". At the ""House of Grace"" on Potomac Avenue on the Upper West Side, Pastor Casper ""Cap"" Farrow not only preaches the word to his own flock, but also teams up with three other congregations to steward a wide gamut of community outreach programs."
"Nazareth Lutheran Church has been a steadfast presence in Riverside almost since the dawn of the neighborhood's history: it's been located on the same site since it was founded in 1914 as a mission of '''Calvary Lutheran Church''' in Cold Spring, and its current building — a charming little red-brick church in a simplified English Gothic style, with stained-glass windows from '''Pike Studio''' in Rochester — was erected in 1949. Today, Nazareth remains a friendly and welcoming congregation headed up by Pastor Dwayne Hendricks and affiliated with the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church. The church also does double duty as home of the '''Boys' & Girls' Clubs of the Northtowns''', a testament to its commitment to community betterment."
"Founded in 1891 as a mission of the '''Richmond Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church''', the Ontario Street United Methodist Church is a community linchpin whose humble but handsome 1914 edifice has been spruced up with a community garden, learning center, meeting space for neighborhood improvement programs, and other resources for Riverside residents. Best of all, pastor Nathan Lange, who also does double duty as leader of Trinity Methodist Church in Grand Island, maintains a friendly, open congregation that receives visitors with the utmost hospitality."
"From humble beginnings as a small mission in a little-developed tract north of Black Rock, Riverside Baptist Church's storied, century-long history has as a common thread an emphasis on bringing the faith into the community at large — ministering to children, the sick, and the elderly, organizing charitable efforts and programs for the less fortunate, and, of course, feeding the spiritual hunger of a robust and diverse congregation. An independent, Bible-believing Baptist church headed by the Rev. Rick English, Riverside Baptist is an inclusive congregation that welcomes all."
"One of the oldest extant churches in the city, what was once called '''St. John's United Evangelical Church''' was founded in what was then the independent Village of Black Rock in 1847 — a fortuitous time, shortly ahead of a flood of German immigrants who would soon populate the vicinity. The interior of the current building, which dates to 1891, has been painstakingly restored to its original splendor. For all the history surrounding it, today St. John's United Church of Christ is a fairly unassuming place — set back on a leafy street surrounded by picture-perfect 150-year-old saltbox houses — and the congregation is as warm and friendly as all that sounds."
"The Reverend Henry Grace is the preacher at the West Side's sole Episcopalian church, the product of a merger between the two titular parishes that occurred in recent years. Adding to the pleasure of worship among St. Mark's & All Saints' friendly congregation is the building itself, a little sandstone church in Riverside built in a charming English country style."
"On Saturday nights at 7PM, Pastor Miguel Calderón preaches to a small congregation of about two dozen faithful in a handsome Lower West Side brick block."
"Active for over three decades and counting, the newly renamed Jehovah Jireh is Buffalo's first Hispanic Methodist congregation, active for over three decades and counting. Services that blend traditionalism with a contemporary, even innovative, touch that speaks to modern-day Hispanics are led by Rev. Dr. Alberto Lanzot in a gleaming new church building a few blocks from Niagara Street. Jehovah Jireh is a congregation that is inclusive, welcoming to visitors, and at the forefront in working to address the issues facing the Lower West Side community."
"At the former '''Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church''', the charismatic Pastor Daniel Nieves heads up rousing, modern-style Pentecostal services conducted bilingually and with an emphasis on youth-oriented ministries. At El Destino, music, dancing, and other performances are incorporated liberally into worship services to better reflect the concerns and lifestyles of real-life people."
"Affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, His Dwelling Place (which takes its name from a passage in the First Book of Chronicles) is a converted 1880s-era brick commercial building where the inimitable Pastor José Robles heads up two rousing, rollicking services each Sunday in both English and Spanish."
"Fuente de Vida is a Hispanic Protestant church where a friendly, close, and tight-knit congregation gathers for lively services conducted in Spanish by husband-and-wife pastors Pedro and Miriam Torres. The venue is the former '''Emmanual Baptist Church''', a stout English Gothic-style brick building erected in 1922 and located on the Lower West Side."
"A Free Methodist Church that serves Buffalo's Hispanic community, Nueva Visión was founded in 1996 by Pastor Miguel Carcaño, a native of the Dominican Republic who preached to a congregation that at first consisted of only a handful of people, but later grew to regularly overwhelm the Grant Street building it holds services in thanks to his tireless efforts in engaging the community, often on a door-to-door basis."
"Located at the corner of Hudson Street and Fargo Avenue, Iglesia Misionera Pentecostal has been active since 1991. In addition to the Spanish-language services that take place every Sunday, a youth ministry and men's and women's groups are also held, on Thursday and Tuesday respectively."
"Pastor Benjamín Bonilla helms friendly and lively Sunday services held at a lovely, stout stone building that was built in 1911 for the '''Trinity Swedish Lutheran Church'''. In addition, various ministries also take place throughout the week."
"This Hispanic Pentecostal congregation was founded in 1989 on the Upper West Side and features rousing bilingual services in the former home of the '''Normal Park Methodist Episcopal Church''', led by a husband-and-wife team of pastors, Ángel and Midian Gauthier."
"The stout, red-brick Richardson Romanesque edifice that was once home to the '''West Avenue Presbyterian Church''' — a storied congregation of old whose roots stretch back to 1831 — was pressed into use in 2010 by pastors Sean and Tammi O'Brien as the home of the independent Pentecostal church they lead. In addition to joyous, energetic services attended by a congregation that's multiracial but majority African-American, All Nations hosts frequent revivals, youth-focused events, and other happenings."
"Buffalonians of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo faith — a growing community of immigrants from Ethiopia, Eritrea and neighboring countries that's centered around Grant Street in the Upper West Side — now have a place of worship to call their own. The former '''West Side Hungarian Evangelical & Reformed Church''', a stout brick edifice in Riverside that dates back to 1923, has been repurposed as the Debre Selam Medhane Alem Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Lively, friendly, and multiethnic services led by head priest Aba Hailemariam Mewded take place weekly."
"A combination mosque and Islamic community center that is a gathering place for a wide variety of events relevant to the West Side Muslim community, al-Eiman is a small, quaint mosque with a diverse congregation and a traditional Sunni orientation. Services are held bilingually in English and Arabic and comprise all prayers, including formal jum'a."
"This humble storefront mosque on an out-of-the-way stretch of Forest Avenue on the Upper West Side serves a largely African congregation."
"Keleti, or ""Eastern"" railway station, grew to became Budapest's main railway terminal, handling the vast majority of international train, mostly coming actually from the west.

To navigate the rather vast station, you may want to take a look at the  [http://www.mav-start.hu/res/keleti_attekinto_terkep_1.pdf station map in PDF]."
"Nyugati (Hungarian for ""western"") is actually in the east of the city, but its name comes from the fact that it originally served western-oriented railway lines, which is no more the case, as the station is limited to handling domestic traffic, including this coming from the east like from Debrecen or Szeged. That said, you may also end up there when coming from abroad, as the trains stopping at Ferihegy arrive here - you can use those trains to connect to bus 200E from Budapest Ferihegy International Airport. The bus-train combination is the quickest way to get to the city centre from the airport. The square in front of the station (predictably named ''Nyugati ter'') also serves as a transport hub with several bus routes, tram routes 4 and 6, and a station on M3 line of the Budapest Metro."

"This synagogue is unique both because of its size, and its two onion-shaped domes, which are forty-three meters high. Onion domes are typically found on Catholic churches, and Hungary is a very Catholic country. Perhaps Ludwig Förster, the architect, meant for it to blend in a bit."
"The city’s Orthodox Jewish congregation decided to build its own independent synagogue in 1909. Late Art Nouveau architecture, built between 1912–13, by the Löffler brothers. The most characteristic synagogue is part of a complex including a school and communal Hall built in 1911. The façade of the synagogue which fronts onto Kazinczy Street is cons dered to be one of the outstanding works of Hungarian Late-Secessionist architecture.

"The same yellow-orange motif found in it, as the Dohány Street great Synagogue is. This is the house of worship built for the 'status quo ante ' Jews who have Neolog's building did not pass. The 'status-quo' synagogue in Rumbach Street was built in 1872, to the design of the Viennese architect, Otto Wagner; it is the only building in Hungary to be designed by him. Built in the Romantic style, the synagogue evidences a strong eastern influence; its two towers remind one of the minarets so characteristic of Islamic architecture. The interior of the synagogue, intricately patterened and painted in Islamic style, is defined by the octagonal, spacious, high, decorative dome which holds eight slender iron columns. It was built not as an exact replica of, but as an homage to the style of the octagonal, domed Dome of the Rock Muslim shrine in Jerusalem The column capitals are decorated with Alhambra Moorish character.

Already in 4th century was here a small,-early Christian, so called ""trichora"" form, similar like in Pécs, (which is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage list),-cemetery chapel.(not proved) - In fact in 1711 built a chapel for the patron saint of St. Roch (to eliminate the devastating plague). Expanded after the 1739-40's plague epidemic, giving thanks to God and the patron Saint, because this epdemic avoided Pest City.

"Not to be confused with the Hungarian National Gallery (''Nemzeti Galéria''), located in Buda Castle. Founded in 1802 by Count Ferenc Széchenyi, whose manuscript, map, numismatic and print collections formed its initial core holdings, the Hungarian National Museum was designed and built by the popular architect Mihály Polláck between 1837-1847. When it opened, it was the fourth largest museum in Europe and '''the first public museum''' in the Hungarian capital. The building became the symbol of the 1848-1849 Revolution so every year on the National Day (March 15) usually commemoration held here. However, it was far enough from the city proper that sometimes loose cattle from the weekly Kálvin tér market wandered into the museum.<br>Before entering, take note of the museum's '''exterior''', a fine example of neoclassical architecture, with an exceptional portico. Eight Corinthian columns support a frieze with an ornamental cornice and a large pediment. The pediment features the allegorical figure of Pannonia (''Pannonia'' was the Roman name for the Hungarian lands) sitting with the Hungarian coat of arms on her shield, surrounded on either side by Science and Art.<br>The exterior of the museum is also significant for what has taken place there. According to a popular urban legend during the 1848 revolutions that swept through Central Europe, on 15 March, Sándor Petőfi (perhaps Hungary's most famous patriotic poet) recited his emotionally gripping poem called ""National Song"" to a large crowd from the left pillar of the National Museum's exterior staircase. This poem pleaded with the nation to liberate Hungary from the Habsburg oppression. Not everyone was impressed. The director of the museum recorded in his diary that a noisy mob had gathered outside the building that day, disturbing his work so much that he left for home.<br>Major acquisitions and collections donated by the Kubinyi, Pyrker, Marczibányi and Jankovich families rapidly expanded the museum's holdings. Late in the 19th century some collections were separated from the general holdings to form new specialized museums such as the Museum(s) of Fine Arts, Applied Arts, Natural Science and Ethnography. Today the museum's five major divisions (archaeology, Middle Ages, modern era, numismatics, historical paintings), two permanent exhibitions, and archaeological library (with over 100,000 volumes!) make it one of the richest museums in Central Europe."

In the basement a labyrinth of prisons was created. Many people were jailed and starved or beaten to death here. 2002, the ""house of fear"" was converted into a stylish but depressing museum about Nazi and communist terror which helps visitors to understand Hungary's 20th century.

"In the 19th Century was a Casino and later as the city's first real acting as a large department store building now houses a huge book store. Bookcafé is located on the second floor of the former Paris Department Store, which currently houses the Alexandra bookstore. Quiet, grandiose space. The beautiful Lotz hall ideal for meetings and established. If you love books and you love the tarnished splendor, be sure to check out here! - The café is decorated with beautiful chandeliers and a fresco-style ceiling, painted by Károly Lotz. His paintings also decorate the rooms of the Parliament building. The grandiose, palace-like interior makes visitors feel like they are in the residence of an aristocrat who once used to live on Andrássy Avenue. What makes Alexandra Bookcafé particularly interesting is that both the building and its interior are fine examples of Art Nouveau, while the café is reminiscent of a renaissance-style ballroom. - The menu contains small, gourmet meals, like salmon on a bagel or cheese platter and a large selection of pastries at reasonable prices.

This café was rammed by a Russian tank in the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and the damage has still not been repaired!

"Great place to try Hungarian cuisine and wines, although quite expensive. Old-style interiors, looks very much like a museum. Tourist mix: half are locals in evening dresses, another are tourists (even backpackers) driven here by travel guide books.
