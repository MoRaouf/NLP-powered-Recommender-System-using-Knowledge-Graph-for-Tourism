For those who don't like seafood, grilled short ribs, Jamaican-style jerk chicken served with plantain fritters, and other land-based entrees call to mind the Cajun fare Guarino serves at '''Shango''' in University Heights.

Broderick Park is historically important as one of Western New York's major crossing points into Canada for fugitive slaves travelling the Underground Railroad, as attested to by a prominent historical marker and the occasional historical reenactments that take place there. Broderick Park was also the site from which the ferry service to Fort Erie, Ontario set off in the days before the '''Peace Bridge'''. Today, Broderick Park is a popular fishing spot where perch, yellow and northern pike, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, and other species native to the Niagara River are reeled in, and is also a haven for picnickers, sunbathers, and bicyclists who pass through Broderick Park along the '''Shoreline Trail'''. Amenities include a picnic shelter, as well as a newly constructed amphitheater, gardens, and interpretive exhibits. Broderick Park is also the northern terminus of the '''Bird Island Pier''' (see below).", "annotation": [[80, 92, "LOC"], [94, 108, "FAC"], [229, 253, "FAC"], [464, 472, "DATE"], [504, 509, "DATE"], [511, 525, "FAC"], [649, 666, "LOC"], [762, 776, "FAC"]]}, {"document": "This upscale restaurant has a great menu of French classics like onion soup and ''canard a l'orange'', excellent service, and good drinks, which can be difficult to find in Cairo.", "annotation": []}, {"document": "Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov (1730-1800) was one of Russia's most outstanding generals, a military strategist and army commander during the reign of Empress Catherine the Great and Emperor Paul I.
