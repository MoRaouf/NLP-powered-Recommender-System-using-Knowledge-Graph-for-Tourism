If you eat at the Pizza Hut restaurant just outside the entrance to the Sound and Light Show, there's a good chance you'll be offered to watch the Sound and Light Show from the roof of the Pizza Hut restaurant for a small tip. While it's not as good as watching the Sound and Light Show from a front row seat inside the fences, it's excellent value for money. As of November 2009, extremely bright lights have been pointed at the roof of the Pizza Hut restaurant and various other buildings to get tourists to attend the Sound and Light Show. They put projection lights towards the Pizza Hut restaurant so it's not easy to see much. the Pizza Hut restaurant has replied by putting up a barricade on the roof of the restaurant to try to block extremely bright lights."

Several frescoes from the early monasteries are displayed. The tapestries and embroideries on the second floor illustrate more homely but highly developed arts. The building itself is a treat, with elaborate wooden screens called ''mashrabiyya'' on the windows and ornately carved wooden arabesque ceilings."

Then wait for your reservation number to be called. Note that by the time you get to the reservation desk, your train may no longer be available, in which case you can try to reserve a different one.

"A huge selection of both macro and micro brews from all over the world, plus home-brewing supplies. Also has a large display filled with good cigars. Word to the wise: the owners are quite stand-offish, especially to first time customers and some of the beers are not that fresh. Watch out for dust!"

No museum admission is needed to get to the restaurant (or to the carousel, for that matter!)."

Just ask; the staff is extremely accommodating; the staff'll make sure you get something you like. The falafel comes highly recommended."
"This tiny joint northeast of the airport is no longer Rochester's best-kept-secret; Adam Richman's ''Man vs. Food Nation'' recently featured Campi's signature dish, the massive Steak Bomber. Take a huge pile of sliced chuck, top Campi's signature dish, the massive Steak Bomber with carmelized onions and other veggies, add Rochester's's meaty hot sauce, and put it all on a 12-inch-diameter toasted roll."
"Dog themed restaurant known for garbage plates and hot dogs with a huge variety of toppings. Tahou's will always be the original, but most locals hold up Dogtown's garbage plates as the best in town."
"One of ""Hot Dog Row"" burger joints in the Seabreeze neighborhood. Motto: ""Where Quality Predominates"". ""Hot Dog Row"" burger joints in the Seabreeze neighborhood have another location in Penfield at Lloyd's Corners."
"The best subs in Rochester, hands down. It's the rolls, freshly baked in-house, that do it. Red Osier roast beef and other high-quality toppings put Rochester to shame. The cookies are also among the best in Rochester."

"Though Duff's didn't invent Buffalo-style chicken wings, most Buffalo natives will tell you that Duff's perfected Buffalo-style chicken wings. Duff's opened Duff's's first Rochester franchise in December 2015, where Duff's serve wings (with a variety of sauces) and sandwiches."

"Mark's is where drunk college kids stumble off of Monroe Ave. to eat a garbage plate. The garbage plates from establishments that reside inside the city limits of Rochester have a decidedly more flavorful character than those in the suburbs. Mark's is the only diner you might ever visit that has a bouncer. Go if only for the spectacle."
"Tahou's is the origin of Rochester's authentic cuisine, the '''garbage plate'''. For a few dollars, Rochester's authentic cuisine, the '''garbage plate''' come with your choice of meat, macaroni salad, home fries, onions and special sauce.

"As if a little slice of Brooklyn has been transported to Rochester, the Pizza Stop makes pizzas the way the Pizza Stop do downstate; even NYC transplants approve! In addition to the thin Neapolitan style, the Pizza Stop make a mean thick Sicilian as well, and the Pizza Stop's stuffed pizza is just over-the-top ridiculous. the Pizza Stop's new location just down the street from the original opened in January 2015."
"The Greece location has the same great pizza and an extended menu."
"Red Osier is best known for Red Osier's Landmark Restaurant in Genesee County, which serves amazing prime rib. But Red Osier's catering division, which focuses on hot prime rib sandwiches, has been expanding in recent years (you can find their catering division, which focuses on hot prime rib sandwiches, at Frontier Field, Sahlen's Stadium, and even the airport, for instance). Red Osier's latest venture is this sandwich shop in the middle of downtown. amazing prime rib is as juicy and tasty as you'll find anywhere, but Red Osier've also got Zweigle's hot dogs, pizza, wings, and specialty sandwiches, all made fresh daily. You can put Dinosaur BBQ sauce on your beef, or try the beef-on-weck pizza (when available)."
"This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo, advertises that This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo ""deliver everything... but babies!"" But primarily, This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo deliver pizza, and This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo've become very successful doing so. Pizza experts scoff at the quality of Pizza experts's pies, but with almost 30 locations in Monroe, Livingston, Ontario, and Wayne Counties, This chain, founded by local legend Salvatore ""Soccer Sam"" Fantauzzo must be doing something right."
"Another Rochester burger joint that grew up along the beach, this one in Greece west of the river. The Greece location has some excellent ice cream."
"Just as authentic as Nick Tahou's, but in a safer part of the city and always open."

But Vic & Irv's closed in 2014, and the manager and many of the employees opened up a new spot just up Hot Dog Row, called Vic's Place. The menu of hots and ground steak sandwiches remains largely the same."

Formerly located in the Grove Place district on University Avenue, Abyssinia opened in 2000 but had to close after a dispute with the property owner. After over a year without a home, Abyssinia've moved to Mount Hope Plaza, and Abyssinia's many fans couldn't be happier. Go for the combos, which are served ''injera'' (Ethiopian bread) or the clay pots of lamb or beef."
"Serves lunch and dinner. Though located away from other travel attractions, the noodles are some of the best in Rochester. Second location in Perinton south of Fairport."
"Wegmans recently replaced Wegmans's old East Avenue store&mdash;the only one left in the city proper&mdash;with a brand new one, even carving out space along East Avenue for a brand new one. a brand new one serves up Italian classics&mdash;made mostly with Wegmans-brand ingredients&mdash;in a peaceful and casually elegant atmosphere. a brand new one's isolated from the rest of the store, so don't worry about dodging shopping carts or dealing with the noise of the grocery."
"If less traditional, more experimental/Western, sushi sounds interesting to you, pay a visit to this excellent sushi restaurant and bar. A special each day of the week; the best values for your buck are the Wednesday $20 all-you-can-eat and the Sunday 3-for-$12 deals."
"This restaurant, named after This restaurant, named after its location in Village Gate Square's location in Village Gate Square, specializes in burgers and flatbread pizzas, but with a distinctly upscale twist.

Of course, This restaurant, named after its location in Village Gate Square is Rochester, so you can even get a fancy version of a garbage plate. Reservations recommended."
"Rochester's last classic diner. A 1948 Orleans diner restored in 1986 to an art deco style. Their motto is ""real food, served real well at real prices"". A neighborhood joint with very good food. Friendly, personal service (the owner the owner himself often takes orders) and fantastic Sunday breakfast/brunch menu: berries & peaches stuffed French toast, tasty savory omelets and a glorious eggs Benedict. Be sure to ask for ""sweet cheese"" on your waffles, pancakes & French toast."
"A cozy eatery in the heart of the Park Avenue neighborhood, offering traditional fare with a slight upscale twist. Most entrees change daily, though a few are constants. Parking is iffy."
"Housed in a former firehouse, Hose 22 offers up great American grill fare."
"According to the jingle, ""Sooner or later, everyone dines at Jines,"" which may only be a slight exaggeration. Jines is one of a cluster of restaurants at the corner of Park and Berkeley, each with very popular sidewalk tables (at least in nice weather), which makes Jines a particularly lively and inviting stretch of Park Avenue. Jines was part of the wave of Greek-American diners that opened in the 60s and 70s, though Jines is more ""family restaurant"" than ""greasy spoon"". The atmosphere and service are familial (the Gines family still runs Jines), and the menu is extensive, hearty, and not without the menu's creativity."
"Located in Henrietta, a sprawling suburb that features mostly grimly terrible chain restaurants, this fantastic Thai spot features reasonable prices, lightning quick service (seriously, it's like they know what you're going to order before you get there) and food that always tastes uncannily fresh and yummy. The ambiance is not great, with a huge cavernous dining room and terrible, terrible art on the walls, but the food is consistently good and you can always get takeout. Make sure to try the Thai iced tea. No need to bother with reservations. Open for lunch and dinner."
"Located in Rochester's snootiest suburb, you wouldn't expect the best deal in Rochester's, but this charming restaurant will give you the most bang for your buck. Authentic and carefully prepared, don't miss the huge mezede village platter (an appetizer that can be easily shared by two or more), gyros and well-spiced kebabs. Lots for vegetarians, and unbelievable sweet potato fries. Reservations only taken for 3 or more. On the weekends Reservations're basically required, or you'll wait hours for a table."
"This popular Japanese restaurant specializes in sushi, particularly This popular Japanese restaurant's sushi rolls, each of which has a rather unique moniker. The Yummy Yummy Roll is highly recommended, but you can also try the Red Dragon Roll, BFF Roll, or of course a Rochester Roll. Other typical Japanese-American dishes are available as well."
"Vietnamese cuisine. Very large portions."
"Features extensive Korean menu -- Korean BBQ, scallion pancakes, spicy stews, etc. All meals come with lots of tasty extras, like fermented black beans and kimchee."
"Looks like nothing from the outside, an easily miss-able hole-in-the-wall place on South Clinton. But inside the outside, an easily miss-able hole-in-the-wall place on South Clinton is a little haven, authentically Japanese, with rice-paper screens and the most perfectly prepared sushi in Rochester. The only staff are the friendly Japanese owners who will offer lots of guidance if you ask."
"Classy yet casual, one of the newest and best-reviewed restaurants in downtown. They have positioned themselves as a great place to get dinner after seeing a performance at the Eastman Theater or Downstairs Cabaret. Dinner-and-theater packages available with some Auditorium Theatre shows; being able to park at the restaurant is a major benefit. Go for sandwiches if you want to spend less than $10, or steaks or seafood if you're willing to spend about $20."
"Upstate NY chain sports bar with an enormous menu. The real attraction is the chicken tenders and honey mustard which are nothing like the frozen variety served at most sports bars. There are dozens of televisions which makes it a good place to watch a game."
"The Beale is known for The Beale's great BBQ dishes, but The Beale've also got some good Cajun and Creole offerings. There is also live music&mdash;blues, primarily&mdash;five nights a week. In addition there is a good selection of beers at the front bar to go with the food."
"Amazing Ribs, Chicken, and Black Beans and Rice among many other things. Expect to wait though! Average wait for a table is easily an hour, they don't take reservations, and unless your whole group is there you can't get on the list. They're a tad vigilant about it, but the place pushes so much business through the place can afford to do so. The Dino is a must when in Rochester, if only for some of the sauce."
"Opened in July 2012, this establishment in Charlotte offers barbecue ""with a Spanish flair""."
"Again, Sticky Lips's not Dino, but Sticky Lips has Sticky Lips's own vibe and charm. Sticky Lips's sauce bottles are decorated with 1940s-style pinups, and the decor features advertisements and periodicals from the same era. The food is good, too, with a very wide variety of options and combos, and five different sauces to choose from. Best part: Sticky Lips're never as crowded as Dinosaur."
"The second location along Henrietta's commercial strip is much bigger, with live music just about every night and a full bar. The second location along Henrietta's commercial strip was absolutely slammed during The second location along Henrietta's commercial strip's first few months, but crowds have moderated a bit; still, it's not a bad idea to get there early on Friday and Saturday evenings."
"2 Vine calls 2 Vine's combination of French and Italian food a ""bistrotoria""&mdash;that is, a combination of a bistro with a trattoria. The new decor and menu, introduced in 2016, reflects a renewed focus on casual accessibility. Delicious vegetarian dishes, as well as a wide selection of fish, veal, etc. Moderately priced and near The Little Theatre."
"While the Bake Shop offers light sandwich fare and breakfast dishes, the real attraction here for foodies is foodies's Edible Atlas dinner series. Every two weeks, the kitchen selects a whole new cuisine to present to intrepid diners, be it Mexican, Korean, Greek, or anything else the chefs can think of. The menu is set in advance; all you have to choose is your beverage. You'll want to get reservations, though, as the Bake Shop offers only 18 seats for each of the Bake Shop's two seatings twice weekly."
"Pretty good reviews for this new restaurant. Check out the 18,000 pennies lining the floor of the lobby; altogether, this new restaurant'd pay for a meal for six."
"After several years of decline, the former Grill at the Strathallan has been rejuvenated as Char Steak & Lounge, and the former Grill at the Strathallan's still one of the finest dining options in Rochester. Upscale American cuisine in a contemporary lounge setting. (Also open for breakfast, featuring DoubleTree hotels' standard breakfast menu.)"
"Despite the name, this isn't some Chinese takeout joint. One of the most eclectic, see-and-be-seen restaurant/bars in Rochester, it's like Grinnell's for hipsters (but in a good way). The menu is ever-changing, but a few staples are always there, including the full pound hamburger. Other options often involve rabbit, duck, and squid, to give you an idea. Even the more pedestrian options, like the pizza and the steak sandwich, are made with high-end ingredients like bison-milk mozzarella. Whatever you order, plan to share it with the rest of your party; all of the dishes are meant to be sampled, family-style. Reservations strongly recommended."
"Grinnell's is the type of place your parents went to for your parents's 5th anniversary&mdash;take that as you will. While the menu is firmly rooted in the 60s and 70s, Grinnell's devoted customers keep coming back for the absolutely impeccable service. From the complimentary valet parking, to the maître d' up front (usually the owner the owner himself), to the veteran servers, Grinnell's's staff perfectly balances a friendly, welcoming atmosphere with the courteous respect that defined mid-century hospitality. The food is highly acclaimed as well, though The food's hardly adventurous; just basic well made steaks, chops, and seafood."
"With a name that means ""slow"", Lento prides Lento on taking no shortcuts in the preparation of fine meals. Everything on the menu, right down to the ketchup on the $12 burgers, is made in-house, from primarily local ingredients whenever possible. The care taken in preparation is reflected in the quality of the food. Lunch service began in Spring 2012, with a focus on getting diners in and out relatively quickly."
"Not an ideal destination for vegetarians, this offshoot of the other Max restaurants focuses firmly on red meat, with a bit of seafood for flavor."
"Considered one of the top restaurants in Rochester, with an elegant atmosphere and a menu to match."
"This restaurant is owned by Wegmans and showcases what Wegmans chefs can do. The menu changes frequently and covers a wide variety of cuisines. The cocktails are something special and are made with the freshest ingredients possible since the flagship Wegmans store is located across the street."
"The former location of Rochester's most upscale restaurant, the '''Rio Bamba''', is now a slightly less upscale Mexican-American restaurant. Rochester's most upscale restaurant, the '''Rio Bamba''''s unique Latin-themed decor remains, however, and the unique cuisine continues to get good reviews. Pig's ears, anyone? Or fried insects? If you want more traditional fare, the tortillas are freshly made in-house."
"The food is only ok, heavy, traditional French&mdash;good for a business lunch or unadventurous out of town guests&mdash;but the desserts are ''spectacular'', with emphasis on pies, tortes, tarts, cakes and specialty cheesecakes. Examples include their Chocolate Tiramisu Torte and White Chocolate Carrot Cake. The mere mention of a trip here for coffee and dessert will get Rochesterians salivating. A full dessert menu is available in the restaurant, but the cakes can also be ordered whole and picked up."
"Creative contemporary Southern/American fare in a very ''cool'' renovated industrial setting. Enjoy the lively bar and the lively bar's scintillating decor, the breezy and fresh patio, or the somewhat quieter upstairs dining room. Not a place for comfort food; in fact, the menu occasionally errs on the side of weirdness, but the menu changes seasonally so the menu's always worth taking a chance."
"Nestled in Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood, near the Highland Park Diner, Rooney's doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside, though, is one of Rochester's's best-kept secrets. Upscale dining in a rustic-romantic atmosphere makes Rooney's an excellent choice for anyone wanting to impress a guest. The menu is upscale American&mdash;veal, duck, lamb, swordfish, etc."
"Possibly the most expensive meal in Rochester... or, for that matter, in the entire six-county area. The menu represents all of the high-end standards without going overboard on the creativity. The service is regarded by locals as impeccable."
"An old military armory is the setting for this trendy, upscale-casual hotspot. What does upscale casual mean? Consider that there's a variety of contemporary dishes on the menu, but you'll also find a ""burger bar"". (Sunday brunch includes a ""hangover burger"" and fried PB&J among other treats.) Put on your best pair of jeans and enjoy. Some diners report inconsistent experiences with the food and service, but the unique setting and romantic atmosphere more than make up for any snags; this trendy, upscale-casual hotspot is all about the atmosphere and the environment. There's a rooftop bar and some amazing outdoor seating available; inside there are more bars and seating across three floors of space."
"Don't go looking for a storefront proudly signed as ""Uncle Ralph's""&mdash;Ralph takes Uncle Ralph's show on the road to different establishments around the city. Uncle Ralph's schedule varies seasonally, so check the web site. Wherever Uncle Ralph's at, and whatever the weather, Uncle Ralph cooks up a variety of meat-based entrees on Uncle Ralph's outdoor grills."
"A high-end, thoroughly vegan French bistro. It's a little piece of French countryside transplanted to Rochester, but without a drop of milk or morsel of meat anywhere. While the entrees are outstanding, the desserts and coffees suffer a bit from the lack of true dairy; almond-milk ice cream just isn't the same. Still, if you're looking for a truly vegan restaurant&mdash;and not just ""vegan-friendly""&mdash;you'll find yourself at home here."
"The walls display various works of art created by local artists, and the stage area/dance floor has an entire roomful of furniture arranged on the ceiling. Drink specials and live entertainment are featured here nightly, presenting popular local and national musical artists."
"This speakeasy-style bar serves up classic pre-Prohibition cocktails and inventive newly crafted ones with a sophisticated style."
"The founders of this newspaper-themed tavern (with a speakeasy feel) call The founders of this newspaper-themed tavern (with a speakeasy feel)'s establishment a ""gastro-lounge"", with a focus on custom cocktails and artisan foods."
"This popular sports bar and grill is expanding and now has four locations around Rochester. The food&mdash;including steaks&mdash;is quite good for a place known mostly as a sports bar. Also worthy of note are the specials: Before 10PM, there is a different draft beer on sale every day of the week. After 10PM, the beer sale ends, but all appetizers are half off. Naturally, the best time to arrive is 9:45PM."
"The epitome of the neighborhood bar, Jeremiah's is best known for The epitome of the neighborhood bar, Jeremiah's's award-winning wings."
"Lux is something of an alternative bar in Rochester and trades on being in the South Wedge to add cred to the atmosphere. Lots of tattoos and piercings and a good PBR special. The back yard is great. They have hammocks in the summer time and a huge wood burning stove for the winter. Lux is something you would expect to find in Brooklyn not Rochester."
"Once a speakeasy during Prohibition, this joint was one of the first in the area to get a liquor license after a liquor license was repealed. Today, this joint's a wild and raucous neighborhood bar; there's no food, but folks come for the drinks and the atmosphere. The deck extends out onto the beach for a great view of Lake Ontario. Parking is non-existent; you'll have to jockey for a spot on the south side of Culver. 21+ only."
"A Mexican restaurant and bar, known for its frozen drinks and Cinco de Mayo parties."
"Rochester's ""soccer friendly"" sports bar. Large selection of single malt scotches and port wine, beer with an emphasis on Belgian drafts."
"Nox eagerly embraces Nox's ""nerd pub"" reputation, naming Nox's menu items and cocktails with pop culture references, from Dracula and Sherlock Holmes to ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter''. The house-designed cocktails are the main attraction, while the food menu focuses on hearty comfort food that uses modern gourmet ingredients."
"Great English beer, poor English food, friendly English staff. A unique atmosphere with reasonable prices, the Toad is an excellent place to get sloshed."
"A retro contemporary lounge with nightly house music DJ's spinning."
"With a name that harkens back to the famous Pythodd Club, the Pythodd Jazz Room seeks to rekindle Rochester's jazz scene. Live music every night starting at 7:30PM."
"Although Rohrbach's is a bit out of the way, Rohrbach's's beer is worth the trip. Certainly the highlight is the Scotch Ale, and if you don't want to travel all the way to the actual brewpub, any number of establishments in the city will have the Scotch Ale on tap, including Frontier Field. However, if there, do try as many of the beers as possible, as it is some of the best craft-brewing in upstate NY. You can get a sampler of 3 oz. glasses before you decide. The food is also quite good and leans toward German fare such as sauerbraten and bratwurst."
"A new English-style pub has replaced the Table 7 lounge."
"This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave is truly a hidden treasure. This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave has some of the nicest staff you will find in the city and an overall friendly atmosphere. This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave also know how to pour the finest Guinness in the city. Although located near the U of R, This small pub tucked away on Mount Hope Avenue away from the hustle and bustle of the East End and Monroe Ave's is hardly a college bar attracting a diverse crowd. The food is also excellent, especially the fish fry that is served on Friday night."
"Where the martinis are as big as the day is long.... so kick off your heels, and loosen your tie."
"This place is the closest Rochester has to a NYC style club. Posh and dramatic a NYC style club spins dance/house music on one side with chill/down tempo beats on the other. a NYC style club is gay friendly, with Friday night being straight night."
"Turcott's Taproom is an English-style pub."
"Just opened in May 2012, Vibe is bringing jazz, blues, and comedy shows to the Village Gate."
"Tons of Belgian and Belgian-style beers on tap at this Downtown bar. Victoire has a large indoor seating area complete with fireplace, but the real attraction is the patio during warmer months, which also has a fireplace because this is Rochester."
"You can get meals here&mdash;with waitstaff, no less&mdash;but the drinks are the attraction at this spot that just opened in August 2012. In keeping with the name, drink prices fluctuate based on popularity... just like stock prices. Keep an eye on the price ticker; buy low and sell high!"
"The name is apropos, as this bar does indeed specialize in chocolates and wines&mdash;the former more so than the latter, some would argue. Still, the wine selection is expertly paired with the desserts, making this bar a very popular place for ending an evening on the town. Housed in an historic century-old house, this bar has a summer patio that looks out on the lovely Neighborhood of the Arts, a great place for people-watching."
"Dressy, sophisticated, and urbane, Flight might be the most well known wine bar in the city. As you might guess, Flight specialize in wine ""flights""&mdash;tastings of a selection of wines based around a theme. You can try three different wines made from the same grape, or perhaps three different grapes from the same region. It's not just wine, either: cheese, chocolate, and even olive oil are presented in flights of three."
"A small but high-quality wine bar in the South Wedge. Some people find the service a bit off-putting, and the lack of seating can be a deterrent, but the wine list is well curated. Also consider heading up the stairs to '''Cheshire''', a classic cocktail bar, which tends to get even better reviews."
"The owners of Veritas left Rochester for New York City, where The owners of Veritas developed The owners of Veritas's love of wine. But years later, The owners of Veritas returned to raise The owners of Veritas's family in a more affordable city. In 2012, The owners of Veritas opened this wine bar, which, in The owners of Veritas's words, aims to be ""casual, warm and educational"". This is achieved through a constantly changing menu of wines presented in a calm but cozy atmosphere. The owners of Veritas are happy to talk about wine with anyone, novice or expert, and this wine bar, which, in their words, aims to be ""casual, warm and educational""'s quickly becoming a destination for wine-lovers who enjoy company while they indulge."
"This cider-only bar just opened in December 2015 and has a dozen ciders on tap and over 100 more in bottles, as well as knowledgeable staff who can help you make a selection. As far as bar food goes, the house specialty is kettle corn, presented in seasonal varieties."
"While distilling has started to grow in the otherwise wine-mad Finger Lakes region, distilling's production has not been seen in Rochester in quite some time. Black Button uses local ingredients to make corn whiskey, wheat vodka, and gin at Black Button's new distillery. Tours and a tasting bar are the amenities available for visitors."

"Another downtown coffee shop, more popular with the art house crowd. Java's prices and products are similar to Spot. Java's also sell a variety of large homemade cookies in a variety of styles for about a dollar. At lunch time, an adjacent cafe-style restaurant serves for soup and sandwiches. Local art adorns the walls and local bands of questionable quality occasionally perform."
"A tribal arts importer orders select creations from area bakers, inviting guests to dine among large African statues. Take in a coffee while you wrestle with desires for an amber necklace."
"A coffee roaster and full service coffee and espresso bar located near the Neighborhood of the Arts, Joe Bean has been mentioned among the best coffee shops in the country. Joe Bean serve some food as well, but the real attraction is the java, which is fair trade and eco-friendly, and roasted right in-house. The focus at Joe Bean is on coffee education; Joe Bean believe that good coffee can be savored and analyzed like good wine, and Joe Bean even offer classes on how to make your own."
"A trendy, popular hangout housed in a former Chevrolet dealership, people come here to relax and socialize while enjoying a cup or two of the brown brew. It's quite acceptable to spend hours here while only buying a single small cup of coffee; students do it all the time. Local art of various sorts is often marked for sale on the walls."

"This property first opened in 1954 as part of the ""Treadway Inn"" chain; This property was the country's very first downtown motel. This property changed hands several times over the years, and had been in a state of disrepair and disrepute since the 1980s. In 2012, however, new ownership invested heavily in This property and now touts This property as Rochester's only downtown boutique hotel. Indeed, the updated decor, furnishings, and amenities have brought new life to This property, and early reviews are very positive. Between the much-needed updates and This property's prime location in the busy nightlife district of the East End, This property could once again become one of Rochester's's most popular hotels, as This property was in the 50s."

One of the tallest buildings in Rochester."
"The newest downtown hotel is five stories with 106 guest rooms. The developers converted three existing historic buildings into a modern hotel, in the process uncovering and restoring some unique architectural details dating back nearly a century. The developers's on-site restaurant is '''Drifters L.B.''', featuring higher-end comfort food made with local ingredients, and a wine list heavy on Finger Lakes vintages."
"Just opened in 2015, this new hotel is a fairly generic mid-priced hotel; this new hotel's main calling card is this new hotel's proximity to Strong Memorial Hospital and the adjacent College Town retail/lifestyle center."

"Famous for boasting the ""Finest in Underground Rock Since 1990"" until Mohawk Place's closure in January 2013, Mohawk Place is back and better than ever. Or, perhaps better said, Mohawk Place's just ""back"" — aside from a new floor, a few touch-ups to the original tin ceiling, and a bar that's more consistently well-stocked than before, new owner Rick Platt has kept Mohawk Place true to Mohawk Place's divey, eccentric roots, to the delight of the local musicians and fans who considered Mohawk Place almost a second home. Mohawk Place's previous iteration was known to book the occasional nationally-known touring act and was beloved for such annual events as the Irving Klaws Halloween Party, the Annual Joe Strummer Tribute Show, and The Smiths vs. The Cure Dance Party; at this early date there's no word on whether any of such annual events as the Irving Klaws Halloween Party, the Annual Joe Strummer Tribute Show, and The Smiths vs. The Cure Dance Party will continue to be the case, but the punk, metal, and hard rock scene in Buffalo is glad all the same to have Mohawk Place open again."

"The first of the four '''Shops at HarborCenter''' to open The first of the four '''Shops at HarborCenter''' to open its doors, in July 2015, at Red Siren owner Sharon Randaccio's doors, in July 2015, at Red Siren owner Sharon Randaccio offers a range of inventory that might best be described as a more carefully curated version of the fare sold at beachside clothing boutiques at the Jersey Shore or other summer resorts, with an accent on the unusual and eye-catching. The offbeat yet stylish summer dresses, one-of-a-kind jewelry, handbags, and accessories, and other options for trendy urban women are miles away from what you'll find at a run-of-the-mill '''Macy's''' or '''JCPenney'''.

"Newly relocated in the '''Market Arcade''' after a successful run of several years in the Elmwood Village, SaiOne is run by Angel Rodriguez, a gregarious native New Yorker who is as enthusiastic about giving impromptu tarot card readings as he is about the fashions he offers at his store at fantastic prices. Sold here is a wide variety of one-of-a-kind clothes, jewelry, handbags, and gifts, including many of his own designs (look for the ""OMI Clothing"" label) as well as other locally produced pieces available only in Buffalo. However, what makes SaiOne stand out among SaiOne's competition is SaiOne's extensive and fashionable selection of menswear — some customers have even opined that the men's clothing here is better than the women's! Prominent among SaiOne's selection of menswear are stylish t-shirts with bold prints and a refreshing lack of ironic pop-culture references or other '''Urban Outfitters'''-style hipster cutesiness, as well as a range of smart accessories and stylish sunglasses."
"Taking over the reins from Sarah Danielle's predecessor at Suite 101A of the Ellicott Square Building, '''Destination by Lee Powers''', Sarah Danielle offers affordable ladies' apparel and accessories in a diverse range of styles — the dresses, casual tops, pants and leggings sold here run the gamut from classic looks to the latest trends, attracting a similarly diverse range of customers. The operative word at Sarah Danielle is ""bold"" — bright colors and vibrant patterns rule the day here — but not so bold that you'll never be able to wear the dresses, casual tops, pants and leggings sold here out and about. A modest range of accessories such as jewelry and handbags, as well as bath and body products, round out the inventory. Best of all, the prices at Sarah Danielle (nothing is over $100!) belie the high quality of the 100% American-made materials and workmanship of the dresses, casual tops, pants and leggings sold here, and frequent sales and promotions sweeten the deal even more."

"Trend Up is the project of Giovanni Centurione, a fashionista, photographer, and local booster-turned- downtown retail pioneer who cut his teeth on the runway scene in New York City around the turn of the millennium before returning to his hometown in 2005 to strike out on his own. Contemporary clothing for the modern male of New York City is the name of the game here: the overarching aesthetic of the jackets, jeans, and t-shirts you'll find at this at this '''Market Arcade''' boutique is an über-stylish take on urban streetwear for teens to thirtysomethings. The ''raison d'être'' is to provide a local retail outlet for great clothing by hard-to-find designers from arounfd the world, and to that effect Trend Up is today Buffalo's only seller of DOPE, European Apparel, and Other UK branded clothing."
"A brand-new boutique selling a range of vintage and modern clothing, jewelry and accessories in the heart of the Theater District, Yar Mo's Muse specializes in mixing and matching pieces from among Yar Mo's's vast inventory of dresses, hats, jewelry, and other accessories to create one-of-a-kind, head-to-toe ensembles that balance timeless elegance with nods to any of a kaleidoscope of head-turning styles.

"Founded in 1892 and run by four generations of its eponymous family, Tiftickjian Oriental Rugs is one of downtown Buffalo's longest-standing businesses, not to mention by far Western New York's largest and best-known dealer in fine Oriental rugs. That uncommon longevity is probably creditable to the second-to-none care taken by the Tiftickjian family of the Tiftickjian family of their customers's customers — buying an Oriental rug is a complicated process that requires extensive knowledge of what you're buying, and the staff here is not only knowledgeable but also trustworthy, even to the point of allowing customers to ""live with"" an Oriental rug for a while in customers's own houses before making a final decision on whether to purchase.

Berger Building''''s namesake department store closed in 1991. returns is thanks to indefatigable owner Joe Incao, whose three-decade career in upscale retail began right in the former '''L. L. Berger Building''', as a shoe salesman in the waning days of the former '''L. L. Berger Building''''s, before taking him to greener pastures in Manhattan where he served as a senior vice-president at Prada, and then full circle to his hometown right in time for his hometown's renaissance. There's a wide gamut of merchandise on offer at the former '''L. L. Berger Building''', much more than just the furniture that gives the former '''L. L. Berger Building''' the former '''L. L. Berger Building''''s name (small-scale items such as chairs and lamps, mostly) — you also have stylish home decorative goods, men's and ladies' fashion accessories (check out men's and ladies''s great selection of unique ties!), and a wide selection of Buffalo-themed souvenirs and gifts, all united by a common thread of eye-catching, vintage- and Midcentury Modern-inspired designs with a witty sense of humor.

"Winner of multiple awards in ''Buffalo Spree'' magazine's annual ""Best of Western New York"" feature, City Wine Merchant was described in ''Buffalo Spree'' magazine's annual ""Best of Western New York"" feature as having ""one of the most discriminating and thoughtful wine selections Western New York has ever seen"".

"With the Niagara Distilling Company, Nick Kotrides, once best known as the former owner of Hertel Avenue's '''Empire Grill''' and Elmwood's '''Toro Tapas Bar''' and '''Faherty's''', along with partner Eric Heuser, who brings to the table ten years of experience at a distillery in Germany, manufactures and bottles a range of organic farm-to-bottle craft spirits sourced exclusively from New York State suppliers. the Niagara Distilling Company currently churns out 2,000 bottles a day of vodka and gin sold under the '''1812''' brand name — with plans to inaugurate a line of moonshine, bourbon and rye in the near future — in a former carriage house and stable whose historically-sensitive restoration was inspired by the revived Distillery District in nearby Toronto. Set back a good distance off Ellicott Street, you pass through a lovely outdoor courtyard with patio seating — a sort of ""beer garden"" for cocktail aficionados — to get to the spacious tasting room/retail outlet in the front of a former carriage house and stable whose historically-sensitive restoration was inspired by the revived Distillery District in nearby Toronto. Tours are also offered on request, and seminars are offered for those who'd like to try those who'd like to try their hand at home distilling's hand at home distilling."
"The second and perhaps more fortuitously-located branch of Buffalo Adore — South Buffalo's favorite outlet of one-of-a-kind Buffalo-themed gifts run by the husband-and-wife team of Andrea and Eric Dacey — opened up shop in the '''Market Arcade''' in September 2015. Here you'll find essentially the same merchandise as at the original Abbott Road store — the usual clothes and coffee mugs augmented by posters, embroidered wall hangings, decorative throw pillows, and other tchotchkes that are the work of locally-based artisans — but in a much more convenient and centralized location in the heart of the downtown Buffalo action."
"The August 2015 opening of the second location of Clayton's Toyland marks a return to the city for a dearly-beloved local institution that left the Elmwood Village for suburbia years ago. At Clayton's Toyland there's not as much floor space to work with as at the main location in Williamsville, so instead of a massive emporium of every kind of toy, game, and stuffed animal imaginable, here you have a carefully curated selection of products specifically selected with Canalside visitors in mind. Naturally, that means a lot of outdoor toys — get your kites, Frisbees, stomp rockets, and paddleball sets at Clayton's's — as well as a cuddly stuffed buffalo free with every purchase of $40 or more. As at the Williamsville store, name brands, Disney and other corporate tie-ins, and video games and other electronics are eschewed in favor of a decidedly old-fashioned selection of quirky, high-quality toys that feed children's imagination."
"Described succinctly and accurately by one reviewer as ""the only decent store left inside the '''Main Place Mall'''"", there's scarcely a better place to go than the Gift Loft if you're in the mood for the kind of souvenir or tchotchke that could only have come from Buffalo. The main stock in trade here are locally-designed, locally-printed and locally-themed t-shirts, glassware and other gifts that pay homage to all the facets of Buffalo's identity. From points of Buffalo pride like chicken wings and fabulous architecture, to dearly departed landmarks like the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', to local politicians and celebrities like Jimmy Griffin and Irv Weinstein, to Buffalo's vibrant Irish, Polish, Italian, German, and other ethnic communities — if there's something you noticed as unique during your trip to Buffalo, there's probably a gift here for you to commemorate something you noticed as unique during your trip to Buffalo. (Yes, that even includes the smell of Cheerios that fills downtown courtesy of the '''General Mills''' factory.) The inventory also includes art and literature by local artists, posters and postcards, handmade jewelry, and an ever-changing range of miscellaneous kitschy baubles. Best of all, the staff — helmed by owner Edwin Jablonski — are supremely friendly, helpful, and will answer any question you have about the staff — helmed by owner Edwin Jablonski —'s products or Buffalo in general."
"The second location of the upscale boutique of the same name that has made such a splash on Hertel Avenue has been in business at the Hotel Lafayette since 2012. In contrast to the focus of the original '''room''' on luxury furniture and housewares, room2 places more of an emphasis on quality gifts, many of which are locally-themed: quirky items such as buffalo-shaped bottle openers and throw pillows with the geographical coordinates of the city printed on throw pillows with the geographical coordinates of the city printed on them are a great way for visitors to downtown to commemorate visitors to downtown's visit to the city. A modest array of accessories such as scarves and jewelry are also on offer, and the typical stock in trade of the Hertel Avenue location is not neglected either: interestingly, many of the same upscale furnishings found in the Hotel Lafayette's guest rooms upstairs are available for sale at room2. As with the original '''room''', the items at room2 are high-end and priced accordingly — the aforementioned throw pillows sell for upwards of $100 — so do not expect any bargains here."
"After six years of selling online the hand-poured soy candles Sharon Snell still produces at Sharon Snell's home in Alden, runaway demand finally got the best of Sharon Snell, and Sharon Snell made the leap in late 2014 to a brick-and-mortar storefront on the ground floor of the '''City Centre Building''' in the Theater District. Still today, the pleasant interior of ScentCerely Yours!, all light-colored wood with rustic folk-art touches, brings a bit of the downhome charm of Alden to the downtown core — and it's a feast for the nose as well as the eyes; customers are encouraged to sniff-test the candles for customers, and there are even coffee tins provided on each shelf as a sort of olfactory palette cleanser. Sharon Snell takes pride in formulating each of these scents Sharon Snell, and there are some really creative and unique options to be had here — ""Forget-Me-Not Linen"", ""Watermelon Lime Splash"", and the musky, manly ""His Place"" are some of the more interesting ones — all boasting aromas that are subtly pleasant without overpowering you with their odor. Sharon Snell individually tests each candle before sale, and perhaps most importantly of all, unlike many eco-friendly candle manufacturers all of ScentCerely Yours' products are made of 100% soybean wax, with no paraffin or other dirty-burning additives. A range of decorative candle holders and other related accessories are also on offer."

From Connie's former career as a photo restorer, Connie has brought to bear dedication, patience, and an unwavering eye for detail to this new venture which began in the family basement before growing into a storefront in suburban Williamsville in 2012, and from there to this new venture which began in the family basement before growing into a storefront in suburban Williamsville in 2012, and from there to its current location four years later's current location four years later — with end results that are a cut above what you'll find elsewhere. The interior of Abino Mills is perfect for browsing — the hardwood floors, dark-toned walls, and warm lighting (brought to you by Buffalo's own '''Litelab''', best-known for designing the light-up dance floor in the movie ''Saturday Night Fever'') really draw shoppers' eyes to the merchandise on the shelves. Speaking of, the selection here consists of a wide variety of bowls, vases, wine glasses, decanters, and the like, crafted in the finest Riedel and Darlington crystalware whose etchings often reflect a Buffalo theme — the kind of upscale, intimate shopping experience that brings to mind the Delaware Avenue of old. If none of that is to your liking, you can work with Abino Mills's staff to create your very own designs."
"If the name of this place brings to mind a bakery for dogs, that's entirely intentional: the Buffalo Barkery opened the Buffalo Barkery's doors in downtown's '''Market Arcade''' in April 2016, the brainchild of a pair of dog-loving sisters-in-law who'd been searching for an alternative to mass-produced, overprocessed pet foods before taking matters into their own hands, offering a line of all-natural, homemade dog biscuits and treats made with all human-grade ingredients (and without preservatives, by-products, or unnecessary fillers). The ""Buffalo"" half of the moniker is done justice as well — specialty biscuit flavors include beef on weck and Buffalo chicken wing, and the Buffalo Barkery also sell a yummy pumpkin treat in the shape of Canalside's own '''Shark Girl'''. Beyond the realm of the edible, the Buffalo Barkery also offers a carefully curated range of high-quality squeak toys, shampoos and grooming supplies, and collars and leashes, all manufactured in the United States. Cat fanciers aren't left in the cold, either: a range of collars, catnip mice, and the like are sold as well."
"Fowler's was one of the quartet of businesses that opened in the brand-new '''Shops at HarborCenter''' in summer 2015, but really the brand-new '''Shops at HarborCenter''''s just the latest iteration of a Buffalo tradition of over a century running. Here sweet-toothed visitors to Canalside can pick up what's considered by wide local consensus to be the best sponge candy in Buffalo, along with a range of other locally-manufactured chocolaty treats and ice cream from Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''."

A wide and changing selection of coins and stamps of all descriptions are available, as are supplies and accessories for the collector. Appraisal service is also available. Despite Lincoln Coin & Stamp's's downtown location, ample free parking is available!"
"M. Steffan's Sons was founded in 1851, and is the oldest continually-operated leather goods store in the United States. Once a powerhouse in the industry, furnishing supplies from M. Steffan's Sons's own tannery to the majority of the United States's shoemakers and harnessmakers as well as selling M. Steffan's Sons's own shoes under the '''Winchester''' brand name, M. Steffan's Sons's today is a smaller business, occupying an unassuming storefront at the north end of the Theater District. There, a huge variety of merchandise is available — buckles, rings, rivets and snaps, leather shoelaces, leatherworking supplies such as needles, shears and thread, and a myriad of other items — all curated by Linda Steffan, scion of the same family that's owned M.

"Bada Bing was one of the last holdouts at the former '''Delaware Court Building''', which was demolished at the end of 2013 to make way for a new high-rise — but now Bada Bing's back in a new location at the other end of Chippewa Street. Much more than just another rowdy Chip Strip nightspot, head chef Dominic Paladino has set to work transforming Bada Bing into an authentic Italian restaurant where guests are treated like family. An ''Artvoice'' feature story described Bada Bing's fare as ""pub grub with an Italian twist"" and gave a succinct description of the ""sangwiches"" served there — garlic bread and grated cheese concoctions that are head chef Dominic Paladino's own creation. Pasta, chicken and sausage parmigiana, chicken wings and fingers, and salads are also available."
"For a light lunch or dinner in a setting unlike any other, the place to be at Canalside is The Blue Line. An outdoor café situated on a pedestrian bridge above the reconstructed Erie Canal — right above the site where the Buffalo Sabres used to face off against the Buffalo Sabres's opponents at the old '''Memorial Auditorium''', hence the name — The Blue Line's menu is a combination of the best of two separate Buffalo restaurants. '''Code Blu Juice Bar''', formerly of Allen Street, sets up shop at lunchtime seven days a week with a menu of healthy smoothies and juice blends, as well as a modest range of light salads such as lentil, wheatberry, and curried chicken. Then, four days a week at dinnertime, '''Just Fries''' (whose brick-and-mortar location can be found on Genesee Street) serves up '''Just Fries''' (whose brick-and-mortar location can be found on Genesee Street)'s eponymous food in a myriad of different gourmet permutations — appetizer-sized potions topped with a variety of sauces and aiolis (including numerous vegan options); main-course ""loaded fry"" platters topped with ground hamburger and cheese, souvlaki meat, and more; desserts of sweet potato fries topped with marshmallow sauce, Nutella, brown sugar and butter, and more."
"After 62 years on Elmwood Avenue, Casa-di-Pizza moved downtown in 2015, making Casa-di-Pizza's mark on the revitalization of Buffalo's business district in Casa-di-Pizza's new home just off the burgeoning 500 Block of Main Street. Though Buffalo's business district in its new home just off the burgeoning 500 Block of Main Street has changed, the menu is much the same as before: at heart Casa-di-Pizza remains an old-school neighborhood pizzeria, Italian restaurant, and bar, whose food — chicken wings and fingers, subs, salads, sandwiches and burgers, pasta dishes, simple yet hearty homestyle entrees such as barbecue chicken and ribs, and, of course, pizza — is as delicious as the menu is unpretentious. One new addition to the menu are the ""breakfast pizzas"" served up to hungry downtown office workers on weekday mornings."
"When The Dish opened in 2011 The Dish was little more than Canalside's answer to '''The Hatch''' at Erie Basin Marina, with a pleasant and summery but fairly unimaginative menu of hot dogs, burgers, and ice cream. But lately owner Kate Elliott has revamped The Dish with a more upscale focus: to the pleasant surprise of diners, interesting new additions such as a tofu ''banh mi'' and curried lentil fritters have appeared on the menu, and old favorites were given innovative new twists, such as a burger made with a blend of short rib and sirloin sourced from '''Pat LaFreida Meats'''. Breakfast time sees a variety of egg sandwiches served up for early birds. As always, ''al fresco'' dining is the rule at The Dish: long communal tables line the boardwalk along the side of the river, with refreshing lake breezes caressing you and the plaintive wail of seagulls serenading you as you eat."
"The aptly named E-Café is more than just another lunch-break destination for the suit-and-tie crowd — The aptly named E-Café's a veritable Internet café, rare in these parts, with free WiFi and a collection of wired PC terminals available free to customers. In The aptly named E-Café, you can get simple but well-prepared lunches and breakfasts served with a smile and lightning speed. The usual range of subs, wraps, burgers, soups, and salads are all on offer and all delicious, but The aptly named E-Café's customers reserve special praise for the dozen or so melt and focaccia sandwiches on offer at lunchtime, from hot ham and roast beef to turkey reuben on rye to tuna on sourdough. Breakfast sees office workers savoring the scent of bacon in the air as office workers gobble up omelettes and breakfast sandwiches (available on English muffins or bagels) before the workday begins. The downside is the coffee, which is just okay. On Fridays The aptly named E-Café close early, but make up for it with free fountain beverages all day."
"Emerson Commons is a food court that's staffed by high school students and faculty from the Buffalo Public Schools' '''Emerson School of Hospitality''' and open on school days. Appropriately enough, the fairly pedestrian cuisine here can be likened to school cafeteria fare kicked up a few notches in quality — the upside, however, is that the fairly pedestrian cuisine here is among the most affordable food you can get in the downtown core. Lunchtime offerings change daily; the menu usually contains two soups, two hot sandwiches, and three heartier main courses. The current week's menus are posted at the website for those who want to make those who want to make their mind up in advance's mind up in advance. Pizza by the slice, a salad bar, and an assortment of homemade desserts are available every day. Breakfast is also served."
"The founding credo of the Pan-American Exposition, held in Buffalo in 1901, was all about ""bringing closer together the peoples of this hemisphere in the peoples of this hemisphere's social, political, and commercial relations"", and The founding credo of the Pan-American Exposition, held in Buffalo in 1901's that collective community spirit that inspired the name of EXPO Market, opened in 2016 in the former home of '''Perfetto''' restaurant by a partnership of local real estate developer Nick Sinatra and restaurateur Paul Tsouflidis, owner of Elmwood Avenue's '''Acropolis''', '''Newbury Street Café''', and '''Crush Juicery''' (the latter two of which have satellite locations here). EXPO Market has been described variously as a ""food court"" for the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''' and as Buffalo's fancier, less culinarily daring answer to the '''West Side Bazaar''', but perhaps a better comparison would be to an upscale take on a university dining hall — compete with colorful contemporary decor on the walls, ''loud'' piped-in music (mostly upbeat, singalong-able '90s and early '00s alt-rock hits), and an overall surprisingly youthful feel to EXPO Market. The dimly lit interior of EXPO Market accentuates stylish decorative accents like the exposed brick of the wall and the track lighting and exposed ductwork on the ceiling, while also calling attention to the brightly lit LED screens and lighting elements that make up an important component of the decor. EXPO Market is home to five food counters, most of which are satellite locations of brick-and-mortar restaurants elsewhere in Buffalo, and all of which offer quick service to the downtown lunch crowd. There's also '''GBGB''' — Gypsy Bohemian Grove Bar — where a team headed jointly by the folks behind the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''' and Allentown's '''Duke's Bohemian Grove''' pour a range of craft brews as well as some of the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''''s signature cocktails — and, in the morning, locally brewed '''Public Coffee'''."
"Run by a partnership helmed by Charlie Goldman of '''Allen Street Hardware Café''' fame, Bobby Alfman's can be compared to a gourmet (and gourmet-priced) version of '''Subway''' sandwich shop. On the menu are your choice of seven deli sandwiches served on same-day-baked 12-inch hoagie rolls — the Number 4 (pastrami and corned beef with Swiss cheese and onion) packs a nice kick courtesy of the spicy mustard the Number 4 (pastrami and corned beef with Swiss cheese and onion) comes slathered in, while the Number 1 (Italian beef with stewed tomatoes and provolone) is pretty underwhelming. Potato chips, fountain drinks, and a soup of the day are available as sides, but on an ''à la carte'' basis only — sadly, there's no ""Fresh Value Meal"" equivalent in the '''Subway''' analogy."
"Unlike many EXPO Market vendors, the menu at the satellite location of Crush Juicery is comparable in range to Crush Juicery's original location: all thirteen of the smoothies and all four of the granola fruit bowls that are available at their little counter within '''Newbury Street Café''' on Elmwood can also be enjoyed at their stand-alone booth downtown, and although its original location's cold-pressed juices and herbal teas are missing, cold-pressed juices and herbal teas's made up for by an enticing menu of $5 breakfasts that are available all day: oatmeal bowls with your choice of fruit topping, yummy Greek yogurt parfaits, and spicy, savory avocado toast topped with crumbled goat cheese. As at Crush Juicery's counterpart, though, the smoothies are the biggest draw at Crush Juicery — standouts include the ""Ventura Boulevard"" (with kale, banana, raw cashew, agave nectar, and almond milk) and the ""Oxford Street"" (avocado, kale, pineapple, banana, coconut water, and spirulina) — all clean, green, healthy, and packed with energy and nutrients. If you want an extra bit of oomph, you can even order your smoothie ""enhanced"" with boosters such as whey protein, turmeric, bee pollen, and creatine."
"'''Osteria 166''''s EXPO Market outlet offers an abbreviated but respectably diverse selection of a half-dozen signature pasta dishes that run the gamut from familiar but well-executed favorites like spaghetti and meatballs, to more interesting creations such as tortellini alfredo with peas, as well as changing daily specials. However, the most recommendable thing on the menu at '''Osteria 166''''s is almost inarguably the $10 build-your-own pasta option that enables many combinations that are more creative than the menu standards. You get your choice of one pasta, one sauce, one meat (perennials like grilled chicken and Italian sausage but also pancetta and Italian pulled pork), and an unlimited number of the two dozen or so vegetable toppings '''Osteria 166''''s offers (unique standouts here include escarole, pine nuts, and wild mushrooms). Throw in a side of risotto sticks or parmesan truffle chips, add a San Pellegrino soda to drink, and you're good to go."
"Another Paul Tsouflidis-owned Elmwood Avenue health-food purveyor with a presence at EXPO Market, at Newbury Street you can choose from a curated selection of their well-beloved wraps and burritos, the ever-popular spicy quinoa bowl with chicken, as well as the full range of signature salads that you can get at the original — yes, this includes the Brainy Beet and the Jalapeño Chicken. However, most visitors to Newbury Street opt for the build-your-own salad — you choose a leafy green as a base, any of four additional vegetable ingredients, premium toppings if you like, and dressing — and build-your-own quinoa bowls and wraps work under similar principles. The locally-baked multigrain bread offered for a paltry 35-cent upcharge, sourced from the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''', tops it all off (figuratively, and literally too if you like)."
"The EXPO iteration of the West Side's ever-popular '''Sun Restaurant''' focuses not on tasty Burmese specialties but on sushi, many varieties of which incorporate chef/owner Kevin Lin's signature ingredient, black rice. Aficionados of the original location will be pleased to know that the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') is indeed included in the selection of side salads, and if you're not in the mood for sushi, you can also avail yourself of black rice pudding, steamed chicken or vegetable dumplings, or refreshing Thai iced tea or coffee to drink."
"Best known as the locally-owned specialty food shop that has inspired such a rabidly loyal fanbase in the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo, the locally-owned specialty food shop that has inspired such a rabidly loyal fanbase in the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo, the Globe Market also operates a small gourmet cafeteria in the '''Cathedral Park Tower''' that's regularly filled with corporate power lunchers from the nearby office buildings. Those who've experienced the the Elmwood Village or Hertel locations will feel at home immediately among the large selection of gourmet specialty salads, sandwiches and wraps on the menu, not to mention the thing that's really put the locally-owned specialty food shop that has inspired such a rabidly loyal fanbase in the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo, the Globe Market on the map: Those who've experienced the Elmwood or Hertel locations's daily selection of delicious soups made from scratch."
"Pretty much the only lifeline keeping the '''Main Place Mall''' alive is the '''Main Place Mall''''s food court (see infobox above), which at lunchtime on weekdays is filled with workers from the attached high-rise office tower. Indeed, if you're downtown on a weekday and you're in the mood for an inexpensive bite, it can be worthwhile to make your way through the corridors past the empty storefronts and enjoy pizza at '''Zesto's''' or '''Gino and Joe's''', deli sandwiches at '''Hoagie Brothers''' or '''H. B. Carver''', Mexican food at '''Tijuana Taco''' or Chinese at '''Ding How Express'''. On weekends it's a dicier proposition; though the '''Main Place Mall''' is open seven days a week, many of the restaurants are closed and the ghost-town ambience can be downright eerie."
"The Hatch is the snack bar at the '''Erie Basin Marina''', serving tasty burgers, hot dogs, fries, and a wide selection of ice cream and other frozen treats. The real appeal of The Hatch, though, are the lovely lake breezes and the stunning waterfront views that grace The Hatch's visitors on hot summer days. the lovely lake breezes and the stunning waterfront views that grace its visitors on hot summer days is why the '''Erie Basin Marina''' is popular not only with boaters but also with joggers, sunbathers, and people-watchers. Convenient to the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Military Park and all downtown attractions. Watch out for seagulls!"
"Downtown Buffalo's staple street food, and probably the most affordable lunch you'll find there, is served by the open-air hot dog carts that work the busy street corners of the business district. Unmissable with the open-air hot dog carts that work the busy street corners of the business district's big, bright red and yellow umbrellas, the most popular selection here is, of course, hot dogs (invariably '''Wardynski's''', for some reason), which go for around $2. Also available for a bit more money are jumbo all-beef franks, Polish and Italian sausage dogs, and, in some cases, burgers. Most carts also offer a value pack of two hot dogs and a drink, which usually run about $4.50. The friendly vendors cook your food before your eyes on portable outdoor grills, slather on the condiments of your choice, and customers can fish soft drinks out of Styrofoam coolers on the sidewalk nearby. On weekdays from roughly 9AM-4:30PM you'll find a dozen or more hot dog carts up and down the Main Street pedestrian mall (especially in '''Lafayette Square''' and around '''Cathedral Park'''), as well as other spots with heavy foot traffic, such as '''Niagara Square''' and '''Canalside'''. Some operate on weekends too, but they're much fewer and further between outside of business hours."
"Located in the splendiferous lobby of the '''Ellicott Square Building''', this corporate power-lunching hotspot is operated by Joseph's Catering Service. As this corporate power-lunching hotspot's name implies, this corporate power-lunching hotspot's specialty is a huge selection of delicious made-to-order panini and wraps. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose, according to conventional wisdom, but for something especially unique try the apple tuna panini or the onion teriyaki burger wrap. Add to this a wide variety of salads (small side salads, specialty main-course salads and a full salad bar), delicious homemade soups that are the highlight of the menu according to local consensus, and smoothies and smoothie shooters made with real fruit, and you have one of the business district's favorite spots for light, healthy and inexpensive lunches on the go. Vegetarians, vegans and the gluten-free crowd are well taken care of too, and not just with salads."
"Ask local foodies what was the most anticipated restaurant opening in recent memory on the 500 Block of Main Street, and local foodies'll invariably say '''Raclette's'''. But a solid second place has to be Don Warfe's lunchtime spot just a few doors down, which opened Don Warfe's's doors in June 2016 at the end of a 19-month-long, stem-to-stern restoration of the historic '''Genesee Block''', the oldest building on the 500 Block of Main Street (''c.'' 1845). The first rule of thumb for Don Warfe's is not to let yourself be put off by the lines that routinely stretch out the door — service is lightning-fast, and the food is worth it. That being said, for best results you should not bother holding out for a table in the postage stamp-sized dining room: if it's a nice day you can enjoy a nice ''al fresco'' lunch at one of the tables on '''Roosevelt Plaza''', or else take your order to go. As for the menu, the inevitable comparison is with Buffalo's other ""French fries as main course"" eatery, the ever-popular '''Allen Street Poutine Company''', and there are indeed some similarities — real, honest-to-goodness poutine is one of the biggest sellers here, available in both the classic fries-gravy-cheese curd setup and ""Buffalo's style"" with blue cheese and hot sauce. But for the most part, the loaded-fry platters that make up the real backbone of the menu are distinct entities: the low prices the loaded-fry platters that make up the real backbone of the menu charge belie the size of the portions and the high quality of the ingredients. Standouts include the souvlaki fries (topped with marinated beef, feta, and ''tzatziki'' sauce), the ''pizza fritta'' (melted mozzarella, marinara sauce, and pepperoni), and the cheeseburger fries (ground Angus beef, cheddar, ketchup, and pickles). Surprisingly enough, the place's major weak spot are the fries the fries themselves: Don Warfe's makes much of the imported German ""air fryer"" Don Warfe's's purchased to that method up healthier fries with 40% less fat and 30% less calories, but consensus says a bit of the flavor is lost with that method. To drink you have a selection of locally-bottled '''Roosevelt Plaza''' craft sodas or — in a nod to '''Roosevelt Plaza''', the old-school malt shop and soda fountain Warfe owns a block down Main Street — homemade milkshakes."
"Mark Marotto may be better-known these days as the chef, owner and namesake of '''Marotto's Restaurant''' in Kenmore. However, the original restaurant where Mark Marotto and Mark Marotto's two brothers cut he and his two brothers's teeth is still alive and kicking in downtown Buffalo, a block from Niagara Square. Founded in 1958 by Mark Marotto's father Jerry Marotto and continuously owned by the family since then, Mark Marotto's DuBois complements the elegant upscale Italian fare available at the Kenmore location with a smaller but equally delicious slate of breakfast and lunch options perfect for on-the-go downtown office workers. Burgers and fries, club sandwiches (featuring turkey roasted and hand-carved in house), and similar items are available, as well as pasta dishes and other somewhat more elaborate fare. Marotto's DuBois wears Marotto's DuBois's old-school identity on Marotto's DuBois's sleeve — the serving staff here is decked out in ""waitress whites"", and Kenmore has the feel of a private club — and Marotto's DuBois's the perfect setting to bear witness to judges and officials from the nearby courthouse talking shop over lunch at ""The Roundtable"", or local hotshot attorneys relaxing at the cocktail bar which stays open long after the kitchen closes."
"After having done a brisk business for over twenty years at the original Natalie's in Amherst, Tony Mansour brought Tony Mansour's trademark slate of quick, light, all-homemade Greek and Lebanese specialties to a second location at the '''Genesee Gateway''' in late 2015. At Natalie's, downtown power lunchers have downtown power lunchers's choice of copious Mediterranean favorites such as shawarma, souvlaki, and gyro that can be ordered either as wraps or full-size platters; fresh, flavorful ''fatoush'' and ''tabbouleh'' salads, ''hummus'' and ''baba ghanoush'' appetizers, and — in the morning — a killer range of breakfast sandwiches. The vegan and vegetarian crowd will be particularly delighted with the wide selection of veggie-, falafel- and hummus-based wraps. Natalie's's delivers, too."
"Serving the best pizza in downtown Buffalo, Prima Pizza & Pasta is situated at the east end of the Chippewa Strip and is a popular place to grab a bite to eat after a night of clubbing. In addition to the astounding variety of pizza, subs, wings, pasta, salads, and tacos are served."
"Opened in January 2015 by Jason Davidson, best known as the proprietor of the nearby waterfront seafood eatery '''Liberty Hound''', Roux Soup Bar occupies the space on the fifth floor of the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}} that was once Roux Soup Bar's cafeteria; as you can imagine, the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}} is still most popular with Roux Soup Bar staffers, but the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}}'s open to the general public too (sign in at the security desk in the lobby), and the {{marker|type=listing|name=Buffalo News Building|lat=42.877643|long=-78.875544}}'s a great place to grab an affordable lunch or light dinner downtown. With a wide variety of po' boys on the menu as well as a delicious seafood gumbo — not to mention a delicious seafood gumbo — not to mention its name's name — it's safe to say that the cuisine here skews Cajun and Creole, an idea that was born of Jason Davidson, best known as the proprietor of the nearby waterfront seafood eatery '''Liberty Hound''''s nostalgia for Jason Davidson, best known as the proprietor of the nearby waterfront seafood eatery '''Liberty Hound''''s former home of New Orleans. But Roux Soup Bar is no one-trick pony: the menu includes local favorites like beef on weck, familiar Greek diner fare like chicken souvlaki served on a pita, and even the po' boy template is used for sandwich fillings that have little to do with Creole cuisine, like chicken Milanese. Most diverse of all are the homemade soups, four apiece that change daily and draw from chef Jamie Zynda's encyclopedic repertoire of delicious recipes. Breakfasts are among the heartiest downtown has to offer, and there's a gargantuan self-serve salad bar. As for ambience, Roux Soup Bar mixes corporate sterility with a few delightfully unique touches: for a taste of local history, there's a glass display case at the front entrance where every day they hang the front cover of the 100-years-old-to-the-day issue of Roux Soup Bar, and the dining room boasts unsurpassed views over both Canalside and the ''News'' building's fourth-floor atrium, ringed with a giant trough where tropical plants grow year-round."
"Open weekdays for breakfast and lunch, this perennial favorite with the downtown office crowd serves simple but tasty Greek diner fare for reasonable prices. The interior is spartan and dated (try to snag one of the unfortunately limited number of outdoor tables if weather permits), but customers rave about Taki's fried-to-perfection French fries, homemade Greek dressing, and light and healthy souvlaki."
"Easily Buffalo's most famous restaurant, and one of the few places in town that could justifiably be called a ""tourist trap"". Whether the Anchor Bar is recommendable to you largely depends on why you've come. If you're a hardcore chicken wing fan who wants to make a pilgrimage to the place where they all began, and maybe pick up some chicken wing-themed T-shirts and other merchandise while you're at the Anchor Bar, you'll likely leave happy: the Anchor Bar is indeed the place where, in 1964, chef Teressa Bellissimo fried up a platter of wings that chef Teressa Bellissimo was about to throw away and served a platter of wings that she was about to throw away and served them, doused in spicy sauce, doused in spicy sauce, to a group of chef Teressa Bellissimo's son's friends who arrived at closing time. But if you care more about a quality dining experience than paying homage to chicken wing history, look elsewhere: service is generic, utterly indifferent, and seems designed to get you in and out as fast as possible, and the food quality and price point are pretty much what you'd expect from a place where the majority of patrons are out-of-towners rather than potential repeat guests. Offerings include wings in various sauces such as barbeque, mild, medium, hot, or ""suicidal"", and also a variety of salads, sandwiches (including that other standout of Easily Buffalo's cuisine, beef on weck), and simple but hearty Italian fare."
"Bambino Bar and Kitchen is a new restaurant downtown that has earned rave reviews for Bambino Bar and Kitchen's casual, simple, and old-fashioned — yet upscale — Italian cuisine served up in an airy, inviting ambience in the Theater District. Wood-fired pizzas are a specialty, with the pizza oven open till midnight M-Th and 2AM F-Sa. By way of appetizers, the mozzarella bar — featuring balls of homemade, hand-stretched mozzarella cheese served with a choice of garnishes that includes Sicilian and Greek olive tapenade, prosciutto di Parma, and Caprese salad — is the most interesting choice. Completing the picture is the modest but delectable range of pastas, soups, salads and heartier entrees, the latter characterized by delicious pork and chicken cutlets of the type that made chef/owner Noel Morreale's previous restaurant, '''Fiamma Steak''' on Hertel Avenue, locally renowned. Some of Bambino Bar and Kitchen's best cocktails are served at the bar, catering and private party space are available, and live music performances happen periodically."
"One of the Theater District's finest dining establishments, the Bijou Grille specializes in upscale Continental and Italian cuisine in a prime setting just across the street from the historic and beautiful Shea's Buffalo Theatre. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads are also available, and the second floor features two elegant and spacious banquet rooms."
"In the heart of the Theater District, Cabaret is a popular place to enjoy high-quality upscale cuisine before or after shows and musicals. A wide variety of delicious salads, sandwiches, and entrees are on offer, with Continental and Italian selections predominating. A banquet room is also offered."
"Conveniently located across the street from the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Buffalo, the Century Grill serves fine food in the majestic ambience of the historic former '''Ancient Landmarks Masonic Lodge'''. Entrees such as steaks and chops, roasted chicken, and pasta dishes are complemented by sandwiches, salads, and an extensive and creative array of appetizers. Local specialties such as fish fry and beef on weck are also served."
"Situated on the ground-floor storefront of the '''Colonial Apartments''' on the northern fringe of downtown, this popular lunch spot is a family-run operation, which cuts both ways: this popular lunch spot's website is not lying when their website touts this popular lunch spot's ""generous sandwich[es] with the freshest bread and finest ingredients"", but it's hard to fire your own flesh and blood, which makes for less-than-stellar service. If you luck out, you might end up with a waitress that's friendly and efficient, but more often the service at this popular lunch spot is slow, indifferent, and downright surly. (Luckily, take-out and delivery are available.) Still, this popular lunch spot packs 'em in during this popular lunch spot's brief lunchtime opening hours, seemingly on the deliciousness of this popular lunch spot's food alone. The sandwiches served here are creative concoctions that are sure to be delicious no matter what you order, on your choice of ten different breads and with a variety of optional toppings. A particular favorite is the smoked turkey salad sandwich blended with fresh dill for an incomparable flavor. All sandwiches come with chips by default, but try a side of sweet potato fries for a $3 upcharge. Grilled fare such as burgers and steak sandwiches are offered (if you're a fan of turkey burgers, this popular lunch spot has an unusual abundance of varieties), specialty salads include a variation on caprese salad with lemon basil vinaigrette in place of balsamic, and fish fries are served on Friday. Prices at this popular lunch spot are high, but — if you're willing to put up with the aforementioned lousy service — you really do get what you pay for."
"In August 2015, the revitalized 500 Block of Main Street landed the eighth and newest location of locally renowned olive oil and vinegar purveyor '''D'Avolio''', and the second to feature an attached restaurant. D'Avolio's Kitchen sates the appetites of the downtown lunch crowd with a menu of ""build your own"" salads, pizzas, antipasto plates, and sandwiches (the latter come with a side salad or cup of soup) for $11.95 apiece. When you enter, you're shown to your table and given a laminate-surfaced blackboard menu and a dry-erase marker; just mark off your selection of ingredients (choose a bread/crust/base of some sort, one or two meats, one or two cheeses, veggie toppings, and condiments) and hand it to your server. There's not much in the way of side dishes or other items on a menu of ""build your own"" salads, pizzas, antipasto plates, and sandwiches (the latter come with a side salad or cup of soup, but a soup du jour and seasonal fruit bowl are offered, as is a wide range of hot and iced teas and other nonalcoholic drinks, plus a somewhat more modest selection of beer and wine. The food is prepared simply but beautifully with time-tested Old World techniques that really bring out the subtle flavors of the ingredients, and portions are large. Best of all, before or after your meal, you can browse the sales racks filled with the same selection of gourmet olive oils and vinegars as at D'Avolio's's retail locations."
"November 2015 saw the debut of yet another entry in the roster of the emerging ""restaurant row"" on Ellicott Street: Deep South Taco is an upscale taquería situated in a former storage warehouse just off Lafayette Square. Paying tribute to owner Richard Hamilton's roots in the Southern U.S. with the name of Deep South Taco, owner Richard Hamilton is an Oklahoma native and veteran restaurateur whose inspiration for Deep South Taco was the authentic, downhome Mexican cooking owner Richard Hamilton dabbled in as a sort of antidote to the hoity-toity fine dining of the places owner Richard Hamilton owned over the years. Far from the sleepy cantina you may be picturing, though, a meal at Deep South Taco is a real experience: as you walk up to Deep South Taco you see a giant rotating ''lucha libre'' mask on the front wall of the building facing Ellicott Street, framed by psychedelic lights and visuals courtesy of an outdoor video projector; indoors you're bathed in garish blue, purple and red LED lights punctuated by the eerie greenish glow of illuminated heating ducts and bar taps. (If that sounds like too much sensory overload for you, there's also the more subdued environment of the heated rooftop patio, open all year, as well as the outdoor street-level patio perfect for warm summer days.) Deep South Taco's menu is small but packs a punch, dominated by a range of different tacos that you order singly — at $4-5 apiece, you can mix and match a combination of several; favorites include the ''taco de pescado'' (with crispy or grilled tilapia and chipotle mayo) and the ''taco de carnitas'' (spicy pulled pork and guajillo serrano salsa). Tacos are served on homemade tortillas that draw mixed reviews: fresh as can be, but fluffier than you may be used to and sometimes prone to falling apart in your hand. Elsewhere on Deep South's menu, there's a meal-in-itself nacho platter smothered in melted ''cortija'' cheese for that extra touch of authenticity, bean and cheese tacos and mushroom tostadas for vegetarian visitors, a chips-and-salsa starter that comes with your choice of three of six salsa options, and side orders of Mexican street corn that are as authentic as Mexican street corn gets."
"Local buzz began to build about Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide — in 1998, when Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide —'s second location opened in Rochester, and Local buzz amplified further when Dinosaur-brand barbecue sauces and other items began turning up in area supermarkets. And when the Buffalo location finally opened in February 2014, the local barbecue scene, formerly nothing to write home about, got a major shot in the arm: even the most ardent ""Buffalovers"" who've experienced its second location concede that Buffalo has some major catching up to do. Situated in a former Universal International Pictures film vault on Franklin Street, its second location is smaller than others in Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide —, but its second location's got the same rowdy roadhouse vibe and is brimming with historic character to boot. Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide —'s fare is Kansas City barbecue done to perfection, lauded on the Travel Channel series ''Man v. Food'' and cited by many reviewers, media outlets, and satisfied customers as the best barbecue north of the Mason-Dixon Line — and by ABC's ''Good Morning America'' as the best in the whole country. Start with appetizers like out-of-this-world fried green tomatoes or ""Dino poutine"" topped with pulled pork, then move on to mains such as barbecue chicken, pulled pork, hand-sliced brisket, and catfish that come with your choice of sides (the mac & cheese is to die for and the peel-and-eat ""drunken spicy shrimp"" are gargantuan, but stay away from the bland ""A.K. Chili"") or as part of a range of combo platters, including a build-your-own option. Also available are some of the most mouth-watering ribs you've ever tasted, marinated all day in a secret spice rub then slowly smoked and glazed with just the right amount of Dinosaur Bar-B-Q — the awesomely popular Syracuse-based chain whose meaty, saucy tentacles spread statewide —'s own barbecue sauce. Prices are decent, especially given the ''huge'' portions — those who are not so hungry might prefer lighter fare such as brisket and pulled pork sandwiches or various burgers — and service is efficient and exceptional, with a staff that's friendly to a fault and happy to point newbies to the best dishes on the menu."
"Opened in December 2015, Frankie Primo's is another milepost in Chippewa's evolution from one-dimensional strip of thumping dance clubs to multifaceted fine dining and entertainment destination. After 16 years as owner of '''Soho Burger Bar''' just down the block, Jay Manno jumped at the chance to open a second Chippewa Street eatery that would serve up some of the Italian food Jay Manno grew up with — simple yet creatively conceived and well-executed specialties from Jay Manno's ancestral homelands of Sicily and Campania — in the former home of '''City Tavern''', whose old-school interior, with its exposed brick, warm-toned woodwork, and original tin ceiling, was a perfect match for the ""Little Italy-type restaurant"" Jay Manno envisioned. Even the ""+39"" suffix in Frankie Primo's's name is a subtle nod to Jay Manno's roots, being Italy's telephone calling code. The backbone of Frankie Primo's's is a deceptively straightforward-seeming yet wide-ranging range of pizzas (fired in a brick oven; not too greasy, with a thin, crispy crust), pasta dishes (including the Roman specialty ''cacio di pepe'', the only place in Buffalo where you can find the Roman specialty ''cacio di pepe'', the only place in Buffalo where you can find it), panini sandwiches (served on fresh, crusty ciabatta bread baked in-house), and main-course salads (the ''cavolo toscano'' is especially interesting; a heaping mound of kale topped with currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino romano cheese, and lemon vinaigrette), which come in ample portions and at prices that aren't half bad for what you get. About a dozen specialty cocktails are served up at the homey bar — classics like Negronis and Manhattans, plus more newfangled creations that still betray a strong classicist influence — and if you prefer your drinks at the table with dinner, the wine selection is encyclopedic."
"Kaydara Noodle Bar opened in August 2012 in the historic Sidway Building with a promise of ""a food experience unlike anything Buffalo has seen before"". True to Kaydara Noodle Bar's word, Kaydara Noodle Bar's ambitious Asian-fusion cuisine delights lovers of Vietnamese, Lao, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine. The focus here is on noodle bowls — Kaydara Noodle Bar's ''pho'' and beef udon bowl are particular favorites — which are complemented on the menu by fried rice dishes, salads and appetizers, and heartier entrees such as spicy black bean pork ribs and beef tenderloin. Vegetarians and vegans will also be pleased with the options offered at Kaydara Noodle Bar."
"Located inside the '''Buffalo & Erie County Naval Park''' at Canalside, Liberty Hound is a celebration of seafood from across the U.S. and the world, in a wonderful lakeside setting convenient to all downtown and waterfront attractions. Traditional offerings such as Maine lobster rolls and crab boil share space on the menu with exotic and innovative offerings, such as steamed littleneck clams with chorizo garlic butter and a Vietnamese-style ''banh mi'' sandwich stuffed with crispy fried calamari, that can be found nowhere else in Buffalo. Best of all are the refreshing lake breezes and lovely views over the waterfront and downtown."
"Justin Anderson that designation Justin Anderson's new eatery as a ""kitchen and beer bar"" — and true to that designation (and mirroring the evolution of Chippewa Street as a whole), the former '''Noir''' nightclub has been revamped into a completely new establishment that offers something more than drinking and rowdy clubbing. The ""kitchen"" half of the equation serves up a classed-up take on pub grub — one major standout from among the list of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers (mostly of the deep-fried variety), personal pizzas, and main-course salads is the ""Ultimate Chicken Sandwich"", where flavorful, well-seasoned grilled chicken comes topped with avocado, goat cheese, tomato, fresh basil, bacon, alfalfa sprouts, potato chips, and pesto mayo for a dazzlingly complex yet ultimately harmonious blend of flavors. A few heartier entrees are on offer as well, including a beer-battered fish fry made with the '''Southern Tier Brewing Company''''s ""One Buffalo"" American blonde ale — a huge seller on Fridays. As for the latter half of the surname, the latter half of the surname's a bit of a misnomer — sure, you've got a pretty good selection of craft beers on tap from local and regional brewers such as the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''', '''12 Gates''', and '''Resurgence''', but also cocktails made with about 50 types of bourbon, Scotch and rye. In every aspect of the experience, Local does justice to Local's name — from the local craft brews, to the Western New York-based suppliers Local uses in many of Local's recipes ('''Camellia Meats''' provides the ham for the Cuban sandwich and the ham and mozzarella melt, for example, while the jalapeño mustard for the soft pretzel appetizer comes from '''Deb's Delights'''), to the huge ""Buffalove"" sign adorning the back wall, even to the interior: wooden beams from an old barn in Clarence were reused here as wall paneling and to build the bar, for a rustic look redolent of nothing so much as an Old West saloon."
"Those who have been paying attention may have noticed subtle changes afoot lately on the Chippewa strip — from a one-trick pony of thumping nightclubs to a much more multifaceted entertainment destination. The Lodge fits right in to subtle changes afoot lately on the Chippewa strip — from a one-trick pony of thumping nightclubs to a much more multifaceted entertainment destination. Opened with great fanfare in December 2013, The Lodge is the brainchild of Adam March, a newcomer on the local restaurant scene who came to own the former location of '''Bayou''' nightclub by winning '''Bayou''' nightclub from '''Bayou''' nightclub's former owner in a pickup basketball game. The Lodge is still part nightclub — The Lodge has a bar and party area on the upper floor that swings after dark, featuring a balcony with a sweeping panoramic view of Chippewa Street below — but The Lodge's main raison d'être is an upscale restaurant, serving what head chef Fortune Macri describes as ""Bold New American"" cuisine, creative and upscale fare of diverse culinary influences. If it's a quieter experience you're after, head to '''The Observatory''', The Lodge's secluded second-floor patio with firepit and attached game room. Seafood reigns supreme on the menu, especially lobster, served milanese style and in a delightful take on mac & cheese; a selection of steaks and chops as well as more inexpensive pasta entrees are also to be had. The Lodge's appetizers are somewhat more adventurous, with Korean short ribs, chile rellenos, and moûles frites as popular options, as well as interesting sandwiches and burgers. The interior is intended to mimic the look of a mountain chalet or ski lodge, but architect Rohit Kapoor has brought a much less rustic and more modern touch to the design."
"Newly opened at the corner of Franklin and Mohawk Streets and already receiving rave reviews from hungry Buffalonians, Osteria 166 is a ""casual Italian eatery and pub"" that walks a fine line between the humble ""red-sauce Italian"" restaurants of Hertel Avenue and what's left of the Italian West Side, and the upscale establishments more typical of downtown. Entrees trend heavily toward the former, with classic favorites such as spaghetti and meatballs, shellfish fra diavolo, and an Italian sausage sandwich all making appearances on the menu. However, the appetizers are far more imaginative, with the creativity of the offerings in that category exemplified by grilled octopus, pork confit, and stuffed pepper risotto cakes. An impressive wine list caps off Osteria 166's menu in grand style."
"The fact that the Pan-American Grill was the first business to open when renovations to the Hotel Lafayette were completed in early 2012 is quite apropos: the Pan-American Grill's lush decor, featuring furnishings original to the Hotel Lafayette that date back to the first decade of the 20th Century, is a tribute to the Pan-American Exposition, which took place in 1901 and for which the Hotel Lafayette was constructed. the Pan-American Grill shares the same owner as the '''Pearl Street Grill & Brewery''' (see below), which means that aside from the fact that many of the delicious craft beers brewed and served at Pearl Street are also available here, the menu at the Pan-American Grill bears a great deal of similarity to the one at the Pan-American Grill's sister restaurant. To call the cuisine here ""pub grub"" would be to do it an injustice, but nonetheless, the fairly elegant take on classic American cuisine served here splits the difference between upscale quality and prices that are far more reasonable than other the Hotel Lafayette dining destinations such as '''Butterwood Sweet & Savory'''. A familiar yet creative range of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees are accompanied by an ample selection of flatbreads and a range of homemade pizzas available in ""Speak Softly"" (12"") and ""Big Stick"" (18"") sizes — another evocation of the Pan-American Exposition era. Simply put, the Pan-American Grill is one of the best options in downtown Buffalo for those in search of a decent sit-down meal that won't break the bank."
"One of the first fine dining establishments to challenge Chippewa Street's previously monolithic identity as a thumping clubber's paradise, Papaya opened Papaya's doors in 2005 on the ground floor of the '''Hampton Inn''' hotel. Serving daring Asian fusion cuisine with an accent on Thai and Vietnamese influences, as well as sushi, Papaya's menu is one of downtown's most innovative. Beer, wine, sake, and cocktails are served including excellent martinis."
"Located in a 1841 brick block in the middle of the former Canal District, which the menu describes as once having been ""the most evil square mile in America"", the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery does the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery's best to evoke those bygone days with an upscale — and unmistakably Buffalo — take on traditional pub grub served in a setting that has been beautifully restored to mimic the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery's 19th-century ambience. An interesting variety of burgers, sandwiches and wraps — including an astounding pulled pork sandwich served with North Carolina-style barbeque sauce, and of course, beef on weck — and hearty entrees are all served, but particularly recommendable are the variety of pizzas on offer at the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery. Best of all, the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery also doubles as a brewery, with a variety of award-winning beers such as the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery's signature brew, ""Trainwreck"", that are brewed on the premises, as well as a rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery is very busy on nights the Buffalo Sabres play at home, due to the Pearl Street Grill & Brewery's proximity to the arena."
"After over a year of preparation, Bob and Dan Syracuse opened Bob and Dan Syracuse's long-awaited downtown Buffalo location of Pizza Plant in fall 2015, in the building at Canalside that's also home to '''Courtyard By Marriott''' hotel. Those who are familiar with the original location on Transit Road will be happy to know that the menu is exactly the same; for the uninitiated, the specialty of their long-awaited downtown Buffalo location of Pizza Plant are '''pods''': like calzones but bigger, '''pods''' are as long as your forearm and contain your choice of pizza topping-style fillings (select from about two dozen specialty pods, or build your own). Equally worthwhile, though, are the selection of thin-crust and stuffed deep-dish pizzas, pasta dishes, and bread bowl salads (including, oddly enough, the best Greek salad in town), not to mention a craft beer selection that rivals anywhere else in town. Vegetarians, vegans, and the gluten-free crowd have a lot to choose from on Pizza Plant's menu, and craft beer tastings, live music, and other events are frequent."
"In what must be a contender for longest lag between initial announcement and opening day, Raclette's the delay Raclette's's doors on the 500 Block of Main Street in March 2016, after just a bit over four years of preparation. The fact that the delay was due to the need for a complete top-to-bottom reconstruction of Raclette's's building — one that many claimed was too far gone to be saved — is testament to the dogged perseverance and dedication of owners Paul and Sandra Wilkens, equally to the preservation of downtown's period buildings as to the provision of a topnotch dining experience to owners Paul and Sandra Wilkens's customers. The specialty to which Raclette's owes Raclette's's name is a Swiss French dish that one might describe as a cousin to fondue — you place a large block of cheese on a flat grill to slowly melt, then scrape a large block of cheese off onto a platter that includes buckwheat crêpes, potatoes and/or gherkins, and your choice of charcuterie meats. The specialty to which Raclettes owes its name's a dish that's available nowhere else in downtown's, and the friendly staff is happy to walk newbies through the process, but a quick meal this is not — Raclette's's advises you to allow at least an hour and a half for the whole experience. If you're pressed for time or otherwise not interested, the balance of the menu is made up of serviceable bistro fare — an interesting selection of Belgian-style ''moûles frites'', main-course salads, and ''coq au vin'' and other classic Gallic fare are dished out at dinner, the lunch menu boasts a range of croques and baguette sandwiches, the French onion soup and vegetable bouillabaisse (the latter one of the few items on the lunch menu suitable for vegans) are spectacular, and there's an extensive and reasonably priced selection of wines available by the bottle or by the glass. All this goodness is served up in one of two environments: an oddly laid out but warm and comfortable dining room, with exposed brick walls full of old-school charm and comfortable, slightly offbeat furniture for an effect described by one reviewer as ""like dining in a wealthy friend's cozy library"", or else outdoors on the breezy sidewalk patio facing Roosevelt Plaza. If there's a complaint to be made about Raclette's's, it's that the portions are more European-sized than American-sized (let alone Buffalo-sized), but the reasonable price point goes a long way to compensate."
"Aside from being one of Buffalo's finest sushi restaurants, Seabar is one of the premier destinations in downtown Buffalo for cocktails and a wide selection of entrees, with Japanese cuisine accompanied on the menu by specialties such as short ribs, glazed duck breast, and linguine with clam sauce. Convenient to the Theater District and the Chippewa strip."
"Located at '''HarborCenter''' a stone's throw away from the '''KeyBank Center''', Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' is the perfect place to catch dinner before a Sabres game — and even if you don't have tickets, the experience at Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' is, in the words of one reviewer, ""probably better than actually going to a Sabres game"". That's because you can watch the Sabres (or pretty much any other team) in grand style on the 38-foot-high (11m high) big-screen TV situated front and center above Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' and visible from all over Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'', as well as some 70 more HD screens covering pretty much every interior surface right down to the mirrors in the restrooms. Fans of traditional sports-bar pub grub will be happy with the menu, but those looking for something a little more distinctive won't be disappointed either — the fare at Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'' includes interesting twists such as beer-can chicken seasoned with a secret-recipe dry rub and served with jicama slaw, Buffalo mac & cheese and fresh hand-cut fries, as well as a charcuterie pizza topped with soppressata, prosciutto, spicy Calabrese salami, pepperoncini, peppadew peppers, and a blend of mozzarella, provolone, and ricotta cheeses. All the food is reliably good, but special praise is heaped on the ""Power Play Poutine"", smothered in locally-produced Yancey's Fancy cheese curds and a gravy that boasts a spicy kick (some speculate that they add Frank's hot sauce). At the extra-long bar, bright white and illuminated to imitate the ice of a hockey arena, you can enjoy a choice of three or four dozen beers available on tap and in bottles, including a great selection of local craft brews from places like the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. The weak link at Buffalo's sports bar ''par excellence'') is the service, which is often dashed-off and indifferent, if still passable."
"""LetTappo's enjoy city dining again"", implores Tappo's website, echoing the sentiment of a growing number of Western New Yorkers. Developer Rocco Termini and Buffalo restaurateur extraordinaire Mike Andrzejewski teamed up in 2013 to convert the former Horton Coffee building into Tappo's. Diners rave about delicious interpretations of classic favorites like lasagne, chicken cacciatore, and Italian wedding soup, as well as more imaginative options such as a basil prawn risotto and Tappo's's lauded brasciole. The wine list features no fewer than 41 imported vintages, with a few domestic wines for good measure. Best of all, the value for what you get can't be beat — and neither can the view of the downtown skyline from the rooftop patio."
"With Toutant, owner James Roberts pays homage to owner James Roberts's roots in Louisiana bayou country — owner James Roberts took the name of the trapping and fishing camp that has family operated there for many years and applied the trapping and fishing camp that has family operated there for many years to the Southern and Cajun food destination owner James Roberts opened in downtown Buffalo in 2015. Local old-timers may remember Toutant's previous tenant, the '''Golden Swan''', one of the diviest of the dive bars of downtown Buffalo — but oh, how times have changed. Toutant has been utterly transformed into three floors of class, with a beautifully restored bar at street level and upper floors that boast great views over the skyline. The decor is understated and mindful of Toutant's historic character, with exposed brick predominating. But you're not here for the view or The decor, you're here to eat, and at Toutant the choice is from a menu that's underwhelming in size but superlative in quality. Start off with a slate of small plates (""sharing is caring"", the menu reminds you) that include delicious, flaky ""cast-iron cornbread"", fried pork cracklins that according to one reviewer ""taste like bacon-flavored chips"", and sausage and bacon smoked in-house, then graduate to main courses including excellent fried chicken — crunchy and not too greasy — or jambalaya whose spiciness you can adjust to your taste, like in an Asian restaurant. All the dishes at Toutant are made with locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible. Weak spots include the service, which tends to be fumbling, thoughtless, and glacially slow (Toutant is newly opened as of this writing, so take those criticisms with a grain of salt) and the noise level, which can be deafening when Toutant is crowded (''i.e.'' more often than not)."
"Opened in 1868 and named for a later owner, German immigrant Michael Ulrich, Ulrich's Tavern is Buffalo's oldest operating restaurant — despite the fact that Ulrich's Tavern spent most of 2013 and 2014 intermittently closed due to the fiduciary woes of Ulrich's Tavern's former owners. Sadly, the German specialties that made up the heart and soul of Ulrich's Tavern's former iteration's menu are paid mere lip service, with maybe a half-dozen options, dubbed ""Ulrich's Favorites"", cordoned off to an isolated sector of the menu: you can get ''wienerschnitzel'', potato pancakes, ''rouladen'', and the ""Oktoberfest"", a platter of three German sausages and sides of sauerkraut and potato salad, but ''wienerschnitzel'', potato pancakes, ''rouladen'', and the ""Oktoberfest"", a platter of three German sausages and sides of sauerkraut and potato salad's about it. The balance of the offerings consist of a slate of sandwiches, burgers and main-course salads that are upscale, but for the most part aren't anything you can't find elsewhere in Buffalo's. sandwiches are big and hearty, though: local favorites like beef on weck and fried bologna with onions are present, the burger is a full half-pound of meat, and the shredded pork sandwich comes with pickles and is served on olive-pressed French bread. And while borscht is technically native to lands east of Germany, Ulrich's Tavern's is one of the few restaurants in Buffalo's where you can find borscht (and borscht's really good). As for drinks, Germanophiles who were disappointed with the food might like the beer and wine list better, with offerings from Germany and elsewhere."
"Appropriately named for the Roman god of wine, Bacchus has always been Chippewa Street's odd-man-out, offering a decidedly upscale and laid-back experience since long before the rest of Chippewa Street's's thumping party bars began to follow suit. Located in the historic Calumet Building, Bacchus is owned and operated by Buffalo's premier restaurateur, Mark Goldman, which locals know makes for an experience of unrelentingly high quality where meticulous attention is paid to every detail. Impeccably prepared specialties of diverse influences — entrees such as panko crusted ahi tuna, steamed Prince Edward Island mussels, and duck confit share space on the menu — are complemented by an impressive wine list with a variety of glasses, half-bottles and full bottles available to suit all tastes. Now open for lunch."
"Proudly serving mouth-watering cuts of the finest aged USDA prime beef in an elegant setting, the Buffalo Chop House is the most exclusive restaurant in the city, with prices to match. What guests to the Buffalo Chop House can expect, however, is luxury that is unmatched in the region, with a variety of steaks as well as pork, lamb and veal chops, chicken dishes, and mouth-watering seafood selections taking center stage on a menu that also features a huge selection of elegantly prepared salads and appetizers, the latter category predominated by seafood selections such as clams casino with apple-smoked bacon and tuna tartare with tomatillo and mango. In October 2014, owner Mark Croce also launched a ""5 for $55"" ''prix mixe'' menu inclusing an appetizer, main course with two sides, and dessert, the better for people to experience the Buffalo Chop House ""without taking out a second mortgage"" (in owner Mark Croce's words). As for the interior ambience, the Buffalo Chop House boastsh a '40s Rat Pack theme that was introduced as part of a recent $750,000 renovation, including a wood-panel inlay on the second-floor wall imported from Indonesia that features an image of Frank Sinatra. the Buffalo Chop House also has the city's finest banquet facility, the '''Franklin Room'''."
"In spring 2014, after a twelve-year stint on the corner of Franklin and Tupper, local restaurateur-turned-real estate magnate Mark Croce closed '''Laughlin's Beer & Barrel''', saying ""it was time for a change"". a change has come in the form of Buffalo Proper, a Roaring Twenties-themed cocktail bar and fine dining restaurant helmed by some of the heaviest hitters of the Western New York restaurant industry: executive chef Edward Forster, formerly of '''Mike A's at the Lafayette''', is joined by '''Vera Pizzeria''' founder John Karel and a pair of young upstarts executive chef Edward Forster, formerly of '''Mike A's at the Lafayette''', brought over from executive chef Edward Forster, formerly of '''Mike A's at the Lafayette''','s most recent creation, Rochester's '''The Revelry''': Zack Mekida and Donny Clutterbuck. In a write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'', Buffalo Proper, a Roaring Twenties-themed cocktail bar and fine dining restaurant helmed by some of the heaviest hitters of the Western New York restaurant industry's food is described as ""honest American cuisine that honors the low country of the South"", but the maddeningly eclectic, immensely creative, and ridiculously upscale concoctions on the menu would be nearly unrecognizable to the average Southerner. For instance, Buffalo Proper, a Roaring Twenties-themed cocktail bar and fine dining restaurant helmed by some of the heaviest hitters of the Western New York restaurant industry don't serve rabbit here: instead, rabbit's ""tartine of rabbit en terrine"" with whole-grain mustard, arugula, pickled onions, and armagnac-apricot mostarda (whatever that is). Even that Southern favorite, slow-roasted pork, is crusted with candied malt, drizzled with an alegrette flavored with local craft beer, and accompanied by kohlrabi sauerkraut. A variety of steaks are offered, and if you're a fan of seafood, try the roast fluke with haricot, brown butter and toasted almonds, or the grilled wild sturgeon garnished with shallots and shaved apples. And yes, all this is as expensive as it sounds."
"Rated one of America's top ten steakhouses, E. B. Green's is located at the elegant Hyatt Regency Hotel & Suites, and is named after the man who was almost inarguably Buffalo's greatest architect, whose firm designed some of Buffalo's's most architecturally significant buildings including the Hyatt the Hyatt itself. Skillful and attentive service, high-quality cuisine, and an upscale ambience combine to furnish patrons with a singularly elegant dining experience. Entrees include veal chops, seafood, duck, rack of lamb, and — of course — a dozen or more different cuts of steak. Sandwiches are available as well."
"At Marble + Rye, Mike Dimmer and Christian Willmott take the upscale touch Mike Dimmer and Christian Willmott brought to Buffalo's food truck scene in 2013 with the '''Black Market Food Truck''' into the world of brick-and-mortar restaurants, with smashing success. Located across from the restored '''Genesee Gateway''' buildings in a part of downtown that's become known as an up-and-coming hotspot for fine dining, Marble + Rye's small but well-curated menu is divided up into a selection of small plates and a somewhat more modest slate of full-sized main courses, emphasizing in both cases fresh, seasonal ingredients that are locally sourced whenever possible. small plates are more expensive but a good sight less creative — a half or whole chicken comes with various mildly interesting accoutrements such as pork-fat potato and oyster mushrooms, while the steak is a run-of-the-mill if well-executed 24-ounce seasoned T-bone — but it's with small plates where Marble + Rye really fires on all cylinders (and don't worry, you won't leave hungry if you order one; portion sizes are much larger than what you'd expect in an upscale restaurant). On that half of the menu, you have pickled onion rings with green garlic aioli; a grilled octopus appetizer that's inconsistent in quality but out of this world when at its best, with charred scallion, jalapeños, and romesco sauce; and a choice of four phenomenal burgers served on homemade buns and cooked to order with a mix of sirloin, brisket, and chuck, perfect for those on a budget. These and other culinary delights are experienced in a dining room that's rustic and homey yet urbane — exposed brick and finished wood abound — and the bright lighting is a welcome change of pace for those who are tired of squinting to read the menu in fancy restaurants. The character continues at the trendy yet laid-back bar, where the selection is dominated by regional microbrews and a range of truly creative house-exclusive craft cocktails making heavy use of rye whiskey, that newly trendy spirit to which Marble + Rye owes half Marble + Rye's name. Service is topnotch: attentive, knowledgeable, and not dashed-off. Marble + Rye gets crowded, so reservations are recommended especially on Friday and Saturday nights."
"Building on Jim Guarino's smashing success at '''Shango''' in University Heights, in September 2014 Jim Guarino launched downtown Buffalo's first seafood restaurant in forever in a 1940s-era building that once housed the '''Waldorf-Astoria Lunch Counter''' and was later a shoe store. Named for the Yoruba goddess of the sea, here a range of amazingly creative seafood concoctions are plated up with aplomb by a staff of servers that really knows their stuff. '''Shango''' in University Heights also has one of the most delicious raw bars you've ever seen, featuring between eight and ten changing varieties of shucked-to-order oysters from all over the world. The menu consists mostly of small plates — if you're dining with a group, they say it's best to order two to three selections per person and pass two to three selections around to share — and boasts standouts such as a creative take on calamari (coated with a pineapple tamarind glaze and topped with a grilled corn salsa), seared bay scallops over coconut rice topped with popcorn (it works, surprisingly), and delectable king crab, lobster, and fish dishes. For those who don't like seafood, grilled short ribs, Jamaican-style jerk chicken served with plantain fritters, and other land-based entrees call to mind the Cajun fare Guarino serves at '''Shango''' in University Heights. At '''Shango''' in University Heights is served an ample selection of wines, creative cocktails, and a slate of regional craft brews. Best of all at '''Shango''' in University Heights, though, is the decor: the extensive renovation not only preserved original Art Deco interior elements such as the frescoes on the wall, but enhanced original Art Deco interior elements such as the frescoes on the wall with modern touches for an upscale ambience that blends the Roaring Twenties with the 21st Century in luxurious style: an Atlantean decadence that seems a world away from downtown Buffalo's."
"One of Buffalo's finest French restaurants, Rue Franklin has served creative and upscale cuisine for over 20 years in a setting redolent of an intimate café in Paris.

"Formerly Shanghai Red's, Templeton Landing is located at '''Erie Basin Marina''', a popular summertime hangout for boaters, walkers, joggers, and people-watchers. Boasting fine food and stunning views of Lake Erie from their patio that is open seasonally, Templeton Landing's entrees comprise hearty fare such as steaks, pork loin, burgers, and ribs, but the true pride of Templeton Landing is Templeton Landing's side dishes, which often share the spotlight with the main course rather than mere afterthoughts. Open all year, but summer is when you really want to come."
"The 31 Club began in the 1940s as Buffalo's premier supper club; though The 31 Club's original incarnation closed in 1983, The 31 Club has now reopened in The 31 Club's original historic brick building on Johnson Park at the north end of downtown. The style and sophistication of The 31 Club has returned, but with a contemporary twist. Freshly prepared Continental cuisine, such as Australian rack of lamb and filet mignon au poivre, is the rule at The 31 Club, as well as martinis and other specialty cocktails. Brunch and lunch are also served."
"Though the Buffalo waterfront is still primarily a warm-weather attraction, the slow growth lately in the trickle of wintertime visitors to places like the '''Erie Basin Marina''' was significant enough by 2015 for local restaurateur Molly Koessler — coming fresh off a successful makeover of local restaurateur Molly Koessler's Black Rock restaurant, '''Acqua''' — to take a chance on a waterfront restaurant that would be open 12 months a year. Appropriately enough, it was on New Year's Eve that the ribbon was cut on William K's. Located next to '''The Hatch''' just past the entrance to the '''Erie Basin Marina''' (there's always ample parking in the huge lot across Erie Street), William K's's dining room is gifted with spectacular views over Buffalo and across the mouth of Buffalo to the historic lighthouse — but unlike some other waterfront restaurants that are content to sell some other waterfront restaurants that are content to sell themselves based on scenery based on scenery, William K's dining room follows through with food that's a cut above the competition in quality, elegance, and price. The menu here is smallish and could be described as an especially innovative take on the upscale steak-and-seafood template with the balance tipped decidedly in favor of the latter: the grilled Spanish octopus over chorizo and chickpea stew is a tantalizing combination of flavors and textures, and a changing selection of fresh seafood from the Gloucester Fish Market comprises the ""Boston's Finest"" seafood platter. Elsewhere on the menu, you've got a variety of steaks and chops, a roasted beet salad topped with burrata, masala milk powder, and locally sourced honey that's arguably the most popular item on the menu, and — for those with a smaller budget to work with — a selection of thin-crust brick-oven pizzas with some very interesting toppings (how about bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, fresh horseradish, and pecorino romano cheese?) Portions tend to be a bit on the small side for the money, but the service is unfailingly attentive and friendly, and there's an extensive wine list and some great craft cocktails at the bar."
"The newly renamed downtown outlet of '''Vasilis Express'''."
"Though it's the only game in town when it comes to downtown Buffalo grocery stores (for now — word is '''Tops''' has signed on as a tenant for a new high-rise planned for a site behind the '''Central Library'''), for years the Washington Market stocked an underwhelming selection of goods that could be charitably compared to an upscale convenience store. No more. A recent change in ownership has breathed new life into this stagnant downtown institution: drawing inspiration from the places new owner Michael Khoury used to frequent in new owner Michael Khoury's hometown of Brooklyn, like '''Foragers Market''', the Washington Market has teamed up with '''Buffalo Cheese Traders''', Niagara County's own '''Dispenza Meats''', and other Western New York producers to offer a much wider range of fine foods with an emphasis on locally-sourced items."

Originally built for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, it is perhaps not surprising that the Exhibition is a particular focus of the exhibits at the newly renamed Buffalo History Museum.

An essay by Charles Beveridge on the Frederick Law Olmsted's park system in Buffalo's describes how well Delaware Park continues to fulfill Delaware Park's intended role as a place for Buffalonians to experience nature and greenery without leaving the city limits; Delaware Park, as per Charles Beveridge's essay, is ""the only public space designed by Frederick Law Olmsted's in Buffalo's that met Frederick Law Olmsted's's definition of the term 'park' — a setting of pastoral scenery extensive enough to provide complete escape from the artificiality and noise of Buffalo's.""

"You might be able to catch the occasional play such as ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" at this intimate black-box performance space on the third floor of the '''Pierce-Arrow Factory''', but the ALT Theatre is much more than a theater, let alone an off-Broadway playhouse. Describing the ALT Theatre as ""a hub for experimentation and innovation in the performing arts"", the ALT Theatre is the place to catch avant-garde performances of new dramatic works as well as in diverse genres such as music, film, and dance.

"Situated at the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street and especially popular with students of nearby Buffalo State College, Voelker's may seem like Voelker's was plucked from another time. Behind a lively bar redolent of old-school Buffalo — the kind of place where you might see Pabst Blue Ribbon being drunk by rough-around-the-edges blue-collar types, rather than ironically by hipsters — are 36 bowling lanes, as well as three pool tables and a few dartboards. Open daily till 4AM, Voelker's's is the place to go for late-night bowling in Buffalo State College."

And, for those who'd rather skip the history lesson and just shoot a few games of pool, The oldest continually operating billiard hall in North America, Hippodrome Billiards's rate of $4 per person per hour is hard to beat."
"After six years spent plying Emily Sajban's wares as one half of the duo behind the Nyack, New York artisanal smithery '''Torch Song Metals''', Emily Sajban packed up and moved west, opening Bon Fire Craft in February 2016 at the recently vacated former home of '''Queen City Shaken & Stirred'''. Jewelry is the game here, and Bon Fire Craft is perhaps the only jewelry shop of its kind in Buffalo in that all stages of production take place in-house: these earrings, necklaces, birthstone pendants, rings, and other pieces are hand-forged, hand-cast, hand-carved, and gems and other inlays are hand-set by Sajban Emily Sajban. There's definitely a house style here, but it's hard to put your finger on and may be impossible to describe in any succinct way — ""rustic"" might be the word that comes closest; popular artistic motifs include trees, leaves, and bears and other forest animals, as well as skulls and Indian-head nickels — and since every piece sold here either comes in a limited-edition run of no more than 50 pieces or else is custom-designed by Emily Sajban to the specifications of a particular buyer, you can be assured that no matter what strikes your fancy on the shelves at Bon Fire Craft, you'll be the only one of your friends to have one! The selection is plentiful for men as well as women, and prices are easy on the pocketbook."

"Modern Nostalgia is a cute women's clothing boutique owned by Nikki Polasik and Brianne Klejdys-Long, a pair of lifelong friends who are described on Modern Nostalgia's website as ""Buffalo all-stars when it comes to style and fashion"". The ""style"" in question takes equal inspiration from elegant classic designs and exciting contemporary looks from up-and-coming designers — hence the name of Modern Nostalgia — and makes the owners' infectious love of fashion all the more obvious. Customers adore Modern Nostalgia — and forgive Modern Nostalgia's somewhat high prices — because of Modern Nostalgia's wide and changing selection of clothes (ranging from formalwear to more casual designs), lingerie, jewelry and accessories. The last two on that list are a particular specialty, with a massive range of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, handbags and clutches from collections by local and national designers, such as Pura Vida, Ornamental Things, and Made By Anatomy. As well, Modern Nostalgia recently absorbed Modern Nostalgia's erstwhile sister (brother?) shop, '''Blue Collar Buffalo''', and now stocks Modern Nostalgia's line of rugged and masculine yet contemporary and stylish menswear under the same roof."
"The first thing a customer may think upon entering Peek-a-Boo Baby Boutique might be that for a storefront that looks so small from the outside and is so packed with merchandise, a storefront that looks so small from the outside and is so packed with merchandise has a remarkably airy, expansive feel, clean and cheerily decorated. Once that first impression is over, the customer may very well marvel at the large and adorable selection of previously-enjoyed items for children from newborns through toddlers — clothes, high chairs, bassinets, strollers, toys, and miscellaneous merchandise — all in impeccable condition. Most of the merchandise is consigned to Peek-a-Boo Baby Boutique by parents of growing children (call for details), but there are also some new items as well, much of which is the unique work of local designers.

"P.S.

The new items that constantly arrive at the store's ensure that there's always a fresh slate of trendy items for shoppers to pore over. Best of all, the staff earns rave reviews for the friendly and helpful care the staff take of the staff's guests, and the prices here can't be beat — the store's's policy is never to charge more than $40 for any item!"

"After over half a century operating out of a breathtaking three-story French Second Empire-style mansion in Allentown, Dana Tillou that move Dana Tillou's gallery to a smaller space on Hertel, and with that move came a change in focus: away from 19th- and early 20th-century American and British paintings and furniture to more contemporary pieces in line with the tastes of a new generation of art and design aficionados. If you've just come to ""browse"", though, never fear: a somewhat more selectively curated variety of works by artists from Buffalo and the surrounding region are still displayed at Dana Tillou's gallery-cum-shop, with locally famous names like Martha Visser't Hooft, Carlo Nisita, and Evelyn Rumsey Cary represented. As well, Dana Tillou has over 47 years of experience in professionally appraising art and antiques for insurance, estate, or personal purposes."

As well, Buffalo Antiques are always on the lookout for quality items to purchase, from single items to partial and total estate sale liquidations.

"This store's name is an unfortunate misnomer: though This store's will gladly purchase your unwanted jewelry, coin collections, ad nauseam, This store's is much more than just another sleazy old-gold dealer. The much more interesting half of the operation is built on owner John Marfoglia's nearly two decades of experience buying and selling at antique shows nationwide, which has put owner John Marfoglia's in touch with some of the leading dealers and collectors in the United States. The fruits of touch are on full display in this Hertel Avenue showroom which was described by one satisfied customer as ""like the best parts of an estate sale were put together in a small shop"". Among the maddening diversity of antiques available here, specialties include weaponry including guns, knives and Japanese swords, ""modern vintage"" paintings, sculptures and other art, and Oriental rugs. Fans of the usual array of furniture, timepieces, light fixtures, jewelry and collectibles won't be disappointed either. JM Gold Buyers are also happy to provide you with a fair-market appraisal for your antiques (JM Gold Buyers even do online appraisals!) and manage your estate sales."
"If there were a competition for the store with the most accurate, short and to the point name in Buffalo, the store with the most accurate, short and to the point name in Buffalo would win a competition for the store with the most accurate, short and to the point name in Buffalo hands down: simply stated, if you have a mancave and you need to outfit a mancave, this is likely to be the first, last, and only stop you'll need to make. That's especially true if you're a beer fan, as the main focus of the inventory that owner Jonathan Gill has put together consists of antique collectibles from the golden age of Buffalo brewing: vintage neon signs, wall clocks, steins, ice chests, and bottle openers emblazoned with the old '''Iroquois''' and '''Simon Pure''' logos abound (if you're not familiar with or interested in those Buffalo brands of yore, never fear; those Buffalo brands of yore've got old-timey national-brand merchandise too). But that's only half the story: in partnership with the '''House of Jacob''' with whom they share the building, Man Cave Outfitters also offers a wide selection of restored vintage guitars and other musical instruments, and there's even a custom jeweler who practices even a custom jeweler who practices his craft in a small nook in the back of the store's craft in a small nook in the back of the store. Prices are fair, and if you have a piece of antique ""breweriana"" of your own that you'd like to unload, Man Cave Outfitters can help with a piece of antique ""breweriana"" of your own that you'd like to unload too."
"Owner Frank Scheuttle has a long history in every aspect of the world of arts and antiques: well-versed in art history and theory thanks to Owner Frank Scheuttle's M.A. in American Folk Culture from the New York State Historical Association's Cooperstown Graduate Program, and tempered in the business side of the field with 40 years of experience as a collector, consultant, dealer, and museum curator. Silent Voices, Owner Frank Scheuttle's Hertel Avenue storefront and gallery space, contains a wide selection of artworks, quilts, crafts, and antiques on display and for sale that represent all facets of the Americana that is the object of Owner Frank Scheuttle's encyclopedic knowledge, boundless enthusiasm, and genuine love."
"Like '''Dana Tillou Fine Arts''' down the street, the WEBB Exchange is a place that's gone through a metamorphosis lately: it was in December 2015 that owners Matt and Kristeen Webb relaunched the art and antique shop owners Matt and Kristeen Webb'd opened two decades earlier as '''Webb Trading Company''', with a newfound focus on high-end midcentury furniture, decorative baubles, and artworks sourced from the private warehouse in downtown Buffalo that serves as a clearinghouse for the pieces owners Matt and Kristeen Webb acquire from estate sales and dealers around the country. And the ""high-end"" part cannot be overstated: among the designer furniture you'll find names like Saarinen, Eames, and Knoll, and owners Matt and Kristeen Webb had an original Picasso painting for sale as of December 2015. If midcentury is not your style and you prefer the 18th- and 19th-century antiques of the old Webb Trading Company days, there's plenty of pieces like the 18th- and 19th-century antiques of the old Webb Trading Company days to be found as well in the WEBB Exchange's 3,000 square feet (275m²) of floor space."
"The selection at this small used book shop directly across from the North Park Theater may not be the widest, but the Second Reader makes up for that with the quality of the Second Reader's merchandise and the friendliness and enthusiasm of the Second Reader's staff — not to mention the surprising and unusual finds that can often be encountered on the shelves there. the Second Reader's excellent prices are exemplified by the ""$1 Book Table"" which makes regular appearances in season on the sidewalk in front of this small used book shop directly across from the North Park Theater. In addition to books, a range of prints, gifts and other ephemera are available here."
"Located at the corner of Hertel and Parker Avenues since 1988, the aptly named Hertel-Parker Liquor Store bucks the usual local trend of stores of this type: customers prefer the massive variety, range and quality of the liquors here to the more modest range of wines. Nonetheless, the aptly named Hertel-Parker Liquor Store is renowned for the friendly and helpful staff that curates the selection. A sticking point among locals is that the owners seem to regard the opening hours as more of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule."
"Though owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter'd been thriving since 2011 at owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter's original location in Lewiston, Savory Sips' move four years later to the more centrally located Hertel Avenue strip was a happy homecoming for owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter. Though casual passersby along the main drag might miss the more centrally located Hertel Avenue strip — the more centrally located Hertel Avenue strip's tucked away behind '''Daisy's Doghouse''', with an entrance facing Norwalk Avenue — Savory Sips' is worth seeking out for the expansive selection of vintages on offer. Though the expansive selection of vintages on offer spans every variety and geographic region imaginable, Savory Sips''s is far from a kitchen-sink approach: all the wines owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter stocks on the shelves are individually selected, organic, small-batch vintages priced under $27 per bottle (more expensive wines, including some very hard-to-find selections, are available by special order on request). Matching the wide-ranging selection is owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter's encyclopedic knowledge of the products owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter stocks and of the wine industry in general, and owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter puts Christie's encyclopedic knowledge of the products she stocks and of the wine industry in general to full use for owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter's customers whether it be helping with a pairing or just talking shop with fellow wine lovers who stop in. The interior of Savory Sips' is owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter's handiwork as well: with walls painted in rich, warm earth tones and a hand-built wine bar in the back, The interior of the store looks like Tuscany by way of Mexico. About the only weakness Savory Sips' has is a disappointing selection of local wines, but do ask owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter about the group wine-tasting excursions to the Finger Lakes, the Niagara Peninsula, and other nearby winemaking regions that owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter offers through owner Rebecca Christie, a proud North Buffalo native daughter's side business, '''Village Wine Tours'''. Free public wine tastings are also held once a month; see the website for details."
"A local business that's already well-loved and well-established in the Elmwood Village, this second location of the venerable Village Beer Merchant opened in 2012. To put it succinctly, this second location of the venerable Village Beer Merchant is heaven for Buffalo beer snobs. As is perhaps obvious, the specialty here is a slate of brews that gives the perennial favorite local beer store, '''Premier Gourmet''', a run for the perennial favorite local beer store, '''Premier Gourmet''''s money: a dizzying gamut of imports, local and regional microbrews, and seasonal selections curated by a knowledgeable and friendly staff eager to direct customers toward the beer that's right for customers. However, the venerable Village Beer Merchant's Hertel location does this second location of the venerable Village Beer Merchant one better with a full tasting room where customers can sample from among the many brews in stock. Vilage Beer Merchant is also a destination for those in search of a wide variety of gourmet specialty foods, with a range of artisanal cheeses, fine olive oils, chocolates, teas, Boar's Head deli meats and other charcuterie, and other upscale edibles."
"Tasty Middle Eastern groceries of all types are the order of the day at Al Noor, with the crowded aisles of this little place fully stocked with everything from spices to Turkish coffee to canned vegetables to sheesha to a small selection of frozen foods. everything from spices to Turkish coffee to canned vegetables to sheesha to a small selection of frozen foods is the real deal, authentic and delicious — especially the halal meats that are the specialty here. Interestingly enough, British visitors will note that Al Noor is the only place in Buffalo that stocks '''Vimto''' soft drinks."
"Though owner Diane Serra's brief experiment in running Caramici's as a full-service bistro is over, Caramici's remains renowned for the delicious desserts crafted by owner Diane Serra's. ""Caramici"" in Italian means ""dear friend"", and owner Diane Serra's is fond of saying that everyone who walks in the door is treated like one — and around here, that's more than just a cute joke. Walk through the door and you'll immediately get the feeling of being in one of the charming little pastry shops in owner Diane Serra's's old stomping grounds of Boston's North End, then head up to the counter and be bowled over by the sight of delicious gourmet cakes creatively and expertly custom-decorated for whatever occasion you can think of (wedding cakes are a specialty). If you've got something smaller in mind, though, Caramici's's still has you covered with a full slate of Italian pastries and sweets such as cannoli, tiramisu, biscotti, and — for an authentic taste of Buffalo you'll find nowhere else — even pastry hearts."
"In the heart of Buffalo's Little Italy, appropriately enough, is found this delightful old-world food shop that seems to have been plucked from another time. Caruso's Italian Imports is a purveyor of delicious yet unpretentious imported foods which has earned more than Caruso's Italian Imports's share of loyal customers over Caruso's Italian Imports's 40 years of operation in North Buffalo. Found here is a myriad of delectable Italian specialties such as pasta, cheeses, olives and olive oils, fresh-baked breads, fine charcuterie such as prosciutto and mortadella, and fresh vegetables. The old-fashioned warmth and friendliness exuded by Caruso's's employees is matched by the prices, which are among the lowest in Buffalo's for specialty groceries of this type."
"Besides being a real ""live wire"", Earnest Thomas is a habitual truth-teller — stop in and you're as likely as not to be met with a greeting like, ""Hello, Earnest Thomas's name is Earnest, and Earnest Thomas cannot tell a lie"". And that penchant for often blunt honesty extends to the name of the store: the seafood sold here truly lives up to the store's name, with only the freshest and highest-quality products delivered to Western New York courtesy of the connections Earnest Thomas made during the 25 years Earnest Thomas spent working as a seafood inspector for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation before returning in 2010 to open a seafood shop in Earnest Thomas's hometown of Eden, followed by this second location in North Buffalo six years later. If you're planning to pay a visit to the store, you might want to carve out a bigger block of time than normal — Earnest Thomas is a walking encyclopedia of edible marine life, and will regale you at interminable length with the minutiae of seemingly every piece of fish Earnest Thomas sells, as well as tales of life on the high seas off the coast of Alaska, local political banter delivered with the opinionated tone you rarely find outside of small towns, and endless jokes as Earnest Thomas packages your order. What's for sale? Salmon makes up a big part of it, all sourced from the wild and typically available fresh, smoked, canned, or ground into burger patties, as well as crabs, clams, scallops and other shellfish — or if you're not in the mood for seafood, check out what may be Buffalo's best selection of venison and game meats, with oddities such as elk steaks, caribou jerky, and alligator meat available for pretty good prices."
"Sandy Hofschneider spent many years working as a registered nurse in North Carolina; this brand-new Hertel Avenue storefront represents the second phase in Sandy Hofschneider's professional life, where Sandy Hofschneider's efforts at promoting the health and wellness of the community come through the sale of healthy extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars — and at great prices. Easily the most interesting products sold at this brand-new Hertel Avenue storefront are the flavored olive oils, where the imported extra-virgin oils that are also sold plain come infused with the delicious aromas of fresh basil, jalapeño, Meyer lemon, garlic mushroom, and more. Infused vinegars are also sold, with blackberry, raspberry, hickory, and chocolate among the available flavors. Best of all, customers are well attended to at this brand-new Hertel Avenue storefront, with the friendly owner always on hand to suggest pairings, share recipes, or — true to form — extol the myriad health benefits of extra-virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegars."
"The west end of the Hertel Avenue strip has a growing cluster of ethnic food shops that all stock basically the same selection of Middle Eastern packaged groceries, frozen foods, and other goods. Jerusalem Halal Market is no different in that regard, but what does set Jerusalem Halal Market apart from the competition is the pleasant shopping experience: Jerusalem Halal Market is clean and brightly lit, the merchandise is well-organized, the aisles are easy to navigate, and customer service is friendly and attentive. As well, Jerusalem has an in-house butcher that sells fresh meat (100% halal, like everything else sold here) several days a week; if an in-house butcher that sells fresh meat (100% halal, like everything else sold here) several days a week's closed when you stop in, there's always an ample selection of frozen meats. Rounding out the inventory is a relatively modest selection of fresh produce as well as hookah pipes, headscarves, and other Islamic clothing."
"Since 1960, Johnny's Meats has offered for sale a full range of meats, cold cuts, and cheeses, many of which are produced locally. Johnny's Meats's homemade Italian sausage, crafted with a secret blend of herbs and cheeses, is a specialty, but Johnny's homemade Italian sausage, crafted with a secret blend of herbs and cheeses's also just the beginning of the story — Johnny's Meats sells a full range of meats, cold cuts, and cheeses, many of which are produced locally. Beef, lamb, bacon, veal, locally produced Sahlen's hot dogs, seafood, pork, poultry, and delicious homemade meatballs all keep Johnny's Meats's loyal customers coming back for more. In another nod to Hertel Avenue's status as the epicenter of Buffalo's Italian community, a small line of pasta products is also available."
"Run by husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo, these founding tenants of the West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''' proved so immediately popular that, barely a year after opening, husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo'd outgrown husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo's booth there and moved to Hertel Avenue, where husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo share the same (larger) space near the east end of the strip. The goods husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo sell are the same as always, though: Eric's stock in trade at the West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''' is gourmet goodies like imported olives and oils, balsamic vinegars in a variety of flavors, honey, and a selection of delicious artisanal fruit butters — and above all, as the name implies, a line of handmade gourmet pastas (including premade packaged ravioli to take home) and sauces. Linguine is a particular specialty; Linguine comes plain as well as in a wide range of flavors such as spinach, jalapeño pepper, or tomato basil. As for Andrea Amodeo's '''[http://www.blackbirdsweets.com Blackbird Sweets]''', a wide range of gourmet pastries are sold that deliver, in Andrea Amodeo's own words, ""confection perfection and wow with every bite"". You can get cookies, muffins, pies, tarts, and lots of other home-baked delights at Blackbird, but the marquee product are cupcakes that come in a diverse selection of flavors — sugar cookie, salted caramel, and oatmeal chocolate chip are among the more interesting ones — crafted so artfully that one reviewer described being hesitant to bite into cookies, muffins, pies, tarts, and lots of other home-baked delights. Consensus says that the cake has real heft to the cake and the frosting is not overpowering in the cake's sweetness. And in the winter months, taking a cue from husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo's former home at the West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''', the husband-and-wife team Eric and Andrea Amodeo team up to host the '''Winter Market on Hertel''', featuring local farmers and food artisans."
"The name of the game at Bella Mia is rekindling the memories of nostalgic customers with ""retro candies"" from nostalgic customers's childhoods. For sale here are old-school favorites like Laffy Taffy, Lemonheads, Necco wafers, and Abba Zabba chocolate bars, Cadbury and Mars candy bars that are imported from Canada and especially popular with customers from north of the border, and delectable oversize lollipops of the kind that will remind customers of a certain age of summers at Crystal Beach. Other confections such as licorice, chocolate truffles, and bubble gum are available as well — and what would a candy store in Buffalo be without a huge selection of sponge candy (available in half-pound, one-pound, and two-pound boxes)? An ice cream counter, coffee and cappuccino, and vintage gifts such as Beatles posters and old-fashioned metal Elvis lunchboxes round out the inventory here. Customers rave especially about Tom, the friendly, down-to-earth owner who always makes sure every visitor to Bella Mia leaves happy."
"Hertel Avenue is the latest setting in the long, itinerant saga of Chow Chocolat: owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz got owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz's start in 2007 in the downtown Theater District, then bounced over to Elmwood for a few years, then to the basement of the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the West Side, and finally, in January 2015, to a former law office in the heart of the North Buffalo action. Though the location may have changed, Chow Chocolat's stock in trade is the same as always: small-batch chocolates and caramels artisanally handcrafted using the finest ingredients: milk from grass-fed cows on local farms, locally-sourced, organic and GMO-free fruits, and more. These delectable goodies, along with delicious house-blend coffees and hot chocolates (try the salted caramel!), are sold to you by an owner who clearly takes pride in owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz's works and in the relationships owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz's cultivated with owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz's loyal customers that have followed owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz in owner and chocolatier Scott Wisz's game of musical chairs around the city. Prices are a touch on the high side, but again, you get what you pay for."
"In November 2015, Phil Machemer finally took the brisk business Phil Machemer'd done for a few seasons selling records on Saturday mornings and afternoons out of a stand at '''The Peddler''' on Elmwood Avenue and parlayed it into a brick-and-mortar store on Hertel in the former site of '''Deja Lu''' — and, in so doing, became the most recent piece of a mini-explosion of new record shops in Buffalo that's most welcome in the years after the demise of the venerable '''Home of the Hits''' and '''New World Record'''. As has become the rule among these new shops, vinyl is the name of the game at Revolver Records. On the racks in this pleasantly airy, brightly-lit space is a gargantuan yet carefully-curated kaleidoscope of some of the most interesting, obscure, sought-after, and above all, ''best'' music on the planet — over 15,000 titles spanning all genres and time periods from the 1950s to the present; everything from popular favorites to hard-to-find imports to offerings from Buffalo's local music scene, all accurately graded. There's a limited selection of music on CD and other formats too. Whatever interests you, be assured that Phil Machemer's encyclopedic knowledge of music is at your service — and if you're still not sure, Revolver Records provides a listening station where customers can listen to any record for customers before purchase; a service that's unique in Buffalo. Revolver Records will also buy any old vinyl you might want to unload — a specialty here is entire collections in a specific genre — and prices are fair whether you're buying or selling."

"Modern & Ancient is a brand-new resale furniture shop located in a quiet setting a short walk off the beaten path of Hertel Avenue. The name of Modern & Ancient splits the difference between Modern & Ancient's two divergent focuses — also sold here are a variety of antiques of ancient vintage, with a special focus on pieces from Sub-Saharan Africa — but Modern & Ancient's bread and butter is a variety of mid-century furniture and home decor that represents the owner's 20-year collection of vintage items. Chairs, end tables, office furniture, accent pieces, and artworks are on offer, as well as large items such as sectional sofas that come in occasionally and are available at blockbuster bargains if you come at the right time.

"Opened in 2005, room is a luxury furniture boutique situated in an airy, architecturally interesting showroom at the heart of Hertel. Described by one reviewer as ""a fantasy world of what one reviewer's living room could be like"", in a pleasant ambience of scented soy candles and elegant chandeliers are placed a bevy of classic modern furniture, dinnerware, rugs, textiles, and other decorative elements and accessories. The brands room carries are not only stylish and cutting-edge, but are often locally manufactured and are united by a commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly production. Also on the same site is '''babyroom''', an outlet for contemporary baby items such as cribs, bunks, strollers and other accessories that, in the words of room's website, ""epitomize 'baby cool'"". These items are high-end and priced accordingly, so come prepared to splurge — if not, sales and promotions do occur on a regular basis. As well, room's staff gets points for being friendly and helpful without crossing the line into pushiness or annoying overhelpfulness."
"Two stores under one roof, these purveyors of furniture and home decor moved to the heart of the Hertel Avenue strip after a short stint in Allentown:"
"Custom lighting is the name of the game here — you may have seen Andrew Emerson's work illuminating downtown hotspots '''Toutant''' and the '''Big Ditch Brewery''' — and the house style is a smart and somewhat whimsical take on industrial chic. Chandeliers and desk lamps are crafted in deceptively simple designs using reclaimed metal tubing, with an end result that's almost worthy of hanging in an art gallery, yet you can also find new-material lamps and sconces done up in a delicious retro style."
"Sean Wrafter first came to the attention of Buffalonians in 2014, when Sean Wrafter turned heads as the designer and builder of the beautiful wooden bar at the newly minted downtown fine dining destination, '''Toutant'''. Today, along with Sean Wrafter's wife Jackie, Sean Wrafter's in business in the heart of the local design district offering to the buying public the same caliber of custom-built furniture: high-quality, one-of-a-kind, locally produced pieces designed by Wrafter Sean Wrafter and sold at surprisingly affordable prices. The Wrafterbuilt aesthetic is simple and elegant, inspired by but not enslaved to the sleek modernism of the middle of the last century, and in all cases upcycled from locally-sourced reclaimed wood and other materials, the better to preserve the old-school quality of workmanship while helping reduce the environmental strain caused by demand for new materials. The interior of Sean Wrafter's shop strikes a balance between art-gallery minimalism and rustic hominess, with abundant polished wood (appropriately enough!), and smaller decorative baubles bring out a whimsical touch — check out Sean Wrafter's line of custom-refurbished axes and hatchets!"
"Though Headin' to Hertel plays perpetual second banana to '''Terrapin Station''' two blocks further down the drag, Headin' to Hertel is still an excellent source for tie-dyes, ""hippie""-informed clothing, accessories, and jewelry, incense, and other such goods. However, what really distinguishes Headin' to Hertel is the selection of glass art Headin' to Hertel offers — Headin' to Hertel lays a strong claim to being Buffalo's premier glass gallery. Custom orders for glassworks are filled by Jason and Aaron, a duo of glass artists whose works are available exclusively through Headin' to Hertel, and a bevy of other pipes and other works of glass art are available in-store. Glass-blowing lessons are even offered periodically. Customers praise Headin' to Hertel not only for the impeccable quality of the products sold there and Headin' to Hertel's friendly and knowledgeable staff, but also for Headin' to Hertel's commitment to the glass art community in Buffalo's and the surrounding region — all of the items sold there are made in the USA, and the majority are produced locally."
"Since 1988, Buffalo's premier head shop has been encouraging locals of all stripes to (in the words of the radio spots that are all over the local airwaves) ""stop in and say hi"". A wide-ranging gamut of tobacco products, t-shirts and other clothing, tie-dyes, jewelry, incense and body oils, and new-age gifts such as crystals and tarot cards are available at Buffalo's premier head shop, all united by that distinctive aesthetic familiar to those who are still on that ""long strange trip"". Perhaps not surprisingly given Buffalo's premier head shop's name, Buffalo's premier head shop is also Buffalo's's foremost source for Grateful Dead-themed merchandise; concert tickets are also sold. Best of all, this eclectic selection is curated by a friendly, mellow staff that goes above and beyond to ensure that customers are well taken care of and have a pleasant shopping experience."
"As the name suggests, hair braiding and extensions are the main order of business at Germa's. However, a secondary attraction at Germa's is a wide variety of African-themed clothing, jewelry, decorative items, gifts and knickknacks, as well as African movies on DVD. Bath and body products are a specialty here — including imported shea butter, body oils and incense — and likewise for authentic artisanal items such as masks, baskets, objets d'art, drums and musical instruments. Clothing for men, women and children in brightly-colored tribal prints is also on offer at Germa's's. The hours of operation are particularly convenient as well — Germa's is open six days a week, and relatively late."
"Operated for over 25 years by owner Maria Pileri, Maria's Italian Gifts is a one-stop shop on Hertel that deals in high-quality goods imported from Italy, including fine Capodimonte-style porcelain, crystalware, objets d'art including carved decorative items in Argento 925 silver and imported wood, greeting cards, figurines and baubles, and other gifts. The specialty here, however, is ''bomboniere'' (wedding keepsakes) — visitors to Buffalo who are looking for the perfect wedding gift, invitations, or the like, or unique gifts for other occasions such as baptisms, bridal or baby showers, or anniversaries, can scarcely do better than Maria's Italian Gifts's."
"New Buffalo Graphics offers a range of items — t-shirts, prints, cards, mugs, and miscellaneous gifts — united by t-shirts, prints, cards, mugs, and miscellaneous gifts's local focus. If you want to commemorate your visit to Western New York with high-quality merchandise emblazoned with icons of buffaloes, photos of beloved Buffalo landmarks like the Peace Bridge and the gone-but-not-forgotten H-O Oats grain elevator, and catchy slogans all the locals can recite by heart (in fact, one of Buffalo's most enduring nicknames, the ""City of No Illusions"", originated as a slogan on a New Buffalo Graphics t-shirt), this is the place for you. All the designs are the work of the friendly owner of this longstanding Buffalo institution, Michael Morgulis, whose knowledge of the ins and outs of Buffalo is matched by the enthusiasm of the friendly owner of this longstanding Buffalo institution, Michael Morgulis, whose knowledge of the ins and outs of Buffalo's love for the friendly owner of this longstanding Buffalo institution, Michael Morgulis, whose knowledge of the ins and outs of Buffalo's hometown."
"Named by owner Lisa Samar after owner Lisa Samar's beloved dog, pet supplies for her beloved dog is the name of the game at the Hertel Avenue storefront previously home to '''Floral Explorations'''. Daisy's Doghouse is an independently-owned specialty boutique carries a full line of natural, holistic, and often locally-sourced products that are priced competitively with mass-market big-brand items: everything from leashes to shampoos to bowls to organic, filler-free dog foods and treats from brands such as '''Fromm''' and '''Wild Callings'''. All this is available to browse in a brightly-painted, well-lit retail floor that also serves as space for the puppy training classes Daisy's Doghouse puts on. You can even choose from a range of animal-themed greeting cards."
"Located in the historic Sample Shop building, the Elmwood Yarn Shop serves the needs of Buffalo's hand-knitting and sewing enthusiasts with a wide range of patterns, buttons, sewing kits, books, and other needs. True to the Elmwood Yarn Shop's name, though, the pride of the Elmwood Yarn Shop's inventory is a dizzying range of yarns, with hand-painted, tweed and novelty selections a specialty, and exotic fibers such as alpaca, camel, and angora available. The yarns here tend toward the high-end and are priced accordingly, though bargain hunters will be pleased with the selection in the sale bins. All this curated by a staff that earns rave reviews for the helpful and informative service the Elmwood Yarn Shop provide to, and the friendly rapport the Elmwood Yarn Shop have with, the Elmwood Yarn Shop's loyal customers."
"Now in a new location near the west end of the Hertel strip, Kurtlyn Cunningham's ""metaphysical and eclectic shoppe"" is a source for an array of unusual goods that are otherwise impossible to find in the local area. Kurtlyn Cunningham's, Kurtlyn Cunningham's opened Love Light & Magick on New Year's Day 2015 and immediately made a splash, offering ritual items and supplies for a Buffalo pagan community that is larger than most locals realize. Practitioners of a diverse array of spiritual traditions, from Santería to Wicca to Voodoo to Buddhism to American Indian spirituality and everything in between, are served with a smile. The inventory comprises candles, offering bowls, essential oils, incense resins, tarot cards and boxes, crystal balls, runestones, and altar clothes, all united by a focus on positivity and searching for harmony with the earth — and goods are locally sourced whenever possible. More than that, though, Love Light & Magick is also a place to go for psychic readings, meditation classes, reiki sessions (on Friday and Saturday nights), seminars on spiritual topics, and even art shows. Staff is friendly and helpful, and unlike many small businesses in the local area, Love Light & Magick's long hours are convenient for those who work during the day."
"A testament to the high-quality goods available here is the fact that Shickluna Bikes & Darts has been in business since 1899 — opening only a year after Rick's Cycle Shop in Allentown, the second-oldest independent shop of this kind in the U.S. Some of the best bikes in existence today — especially Giant brand bikes, of which Shickluna Bikes & Darts is a licensed dealer — are displayed for sale in the ample showroom, with models available for everyone from families and everyday cyclists, to enthusiasts of mountain and off-road biking, to professional racers. Some of the best bikes in existence today — especially Giant brand bikes, of which Shickluna is a licensed dealer — are assembled onsite by a professional bike mechanic and come with a year of free adjustments and flat-tire repair. Shickluna Bikes & Darts also doubles as Buffalo's premier dart shop, with soft- and steel-tip darts and boards by such brands as Dart World and Harrows. Customer service at Shickluna Bikes & Darts can be indifferent, but the products sold here are of the highest quality and the prices can't be beat."
"The centuries-old tradition of Iroquois herbal medicine is the name of the game at this new Hertel Avenue shop owned by Mark Okwahotekakahrake Jamieson (""Eyes of the Wolf""), a full-blooded Mohawk who is learned in The centuries-old tradition of Iroquois herbal medicine and keen on passing The centuries-old tradition of Iroquois herbal medicine down to the next generation of Natives as well as Buffalonians in general. At Six Nations Herbal Remedies, there's seemingly a plant, root, flower, or tea for every malady — and if you can't find one for what ails you, just ask Mark and Mark'll put in an order. Six Nations Herbal Remedies's decor is minimalist and all business, with monochrome walls lined with row after row of jarred herbs as well as jewelry, artwork, musical instruments, dreamcatchers, and other crafts handmade by local Amerindian artisans — all watched over by a large stuffed bear, the keeper of herbal medicine according to Iroquois tradition.

"The Virgil Avenue Tobacconist's slogan proudly declares it to be ""where the city smokes"", and if local renown is a measure of quality, that's hardly an exaggeration. This one-stop shop just off Hertel offers everything the the city smoking enthusiast could conceivably desire: imported cigarettes, pipes and pipe tobacco, rolling papers, loose cigarette tobacco, and — the main draw — a dizzying range of premium cigars shipped directly from factory to store. Ashton, Hemmingway, Arturo Fuentes, and Cohiba are only a few of the many brands to be found in Virgil Avenue's massive walk-in humidor. Also part of the package is the Rocky Patel Lounge, a cigar lounge with a large-screen HDTV, beverages including a complimentary coffee bar, and club-style seating for up to 20 people."

"If you've followed your GPS from Hertel onto Botsford Place, you might think you've taken a wrong turn — Flying Anvil Metalworks is located in an anonymous brick industrial building in West Hertel, surrounded by warehouses and big-rig parking lots. But appearances can be deceiving: inside, you'll find a bevy of unique, custom-made furniture, collectibles, architectural and interior elements, and ''objets d'art'' fashioned by owners Mollie Atkinson and Kenny Kash out of steel, copper, brass and aluminum. Flying Anvil Metalworks'll work with you to fashion your own metal-art masterpiece whether it be functional or strictly decorative, or you can browse Flying Anvil Metalworks's ample selection of antique and collectible metal art made by others.

"The much-ballyhooed Queen City Wine & Liquor may have only opened in August 2014, but The much-ballyhooed Queen City Wine & Liquor has already earned rave reviews for the great variety of wine and spirits that fill the shelves of The much-ballyhooed Queen City Wine & Liquor's ample, warehouse-like interior — ranging from the basics to delightful oddballs like handmade, gluten-free craft vodka — at prices that are among the best in town. As well, the staff here keeps the staff here's ear to the ground and eagerly accepts suggestions from the staff here's growing customer base for new vintages and liquors to stock.

"Buffalo LUV relocated in 2015 from Buffalo LUV's original digs in Allentown to off-the-beaten-path West Hertel, but other than that the story remains the same. The marquee item here is glass pipes and other ""functional art glass"" blown before your eyes by master artisan Matthew Lazzaro, but glass pipes and other ""functional art glass"" blown before your eyes by master artisan Matthew Lazzaro's really only the beginning of the story: there's glass sculptures, custom-made Christmas ornaments, and a variety of other glassware produced in-house by ""Lazz"" or elsewhere in the local area by other Buffalo-based artists, as well as antiques aplenty. glass sculptures, custom-made Christmas ornaments are some high-quality pieces crowding the shelves on the sales floor; the offerings trend heavily toward early- and mid-20th-century handpainted furniture and quirky decorative tchotchkes.

"O'Connell's is a family-owned and operated clothier whose ambience is redolent of an earlier time in retail, featuring merchandise crafted with pride and skill and sold to the public by helpful salespeople dedicated to building friendly and lasting personal relationships with their customers. High-end men's formalwear is a specialty at O'Connell's's; the suits, sportcoats, dress shirts, shoes, slacks, ties and accessories offered here are of a style that is a unique combination of staid conservatism and quirky individuality (witness, for example, cufflinks shaped like race cars and champagne bottles).

"The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique may be small, but — as hinted at by the impeccable effort put into the fabulous window displays looking out onto Main Street — the selection here is vast, diverse, and constantly changing. The clothing at The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique is characterized by fun, sassy fashions with bright colors and a chic urban style, but it's the selection of accessories that really distinguishes The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique: handbags, belts, jewelry, scarves and sunglasses — and above all, what may be the city's best selection of women's hats — all take a prominent place among the merchandise at The vivacious Pam Alexander's eponymous women's clothing boutique All major credit cards are accepted, as well as PayPal for online orders."
"Iron Crown may play perpetual second banana to Iron Crown's neighbor further up Main Street, Queen City Bookstore, but Iron Crown makes up for that with Iron Crown's reasonable prices, customer service that is arguably even more friendly and personable than its neighbor further up Main Street, Queen City Bookstore's, and — above all — a full range of supplies for players of Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and other card games.

"In business since 1971, Talking Leaves Books is Buffalo's oldest independent bookstore. To quote from Talking Leaves Books's website, the name Talking Leaves ""derives from a recurrent conceptualization of books by peoples who were unfamiliar with print; book pages were seen as 'leaves' that 'talked,' imparting wisdom and knowledge and spirit... an intriguing way of keeping track of the treasures of the people: the people's minds and the people's ways of being in, and understanding, the world."" True to a recurrent conceptualization of books by peoples who were unfamiliar with print, offered here is a vast selection of the sort of books that expand people's consciousness, with an especial emphasis on unusual and oft-neglected topics. But what Buffalonians love most about Talking Leaves Books is the staff, who take sincere pleasure in customer service whether it be special-ordering books not currently in stock, making interesting recommendations, or attending to any problems customers may have. Talking Leaves Books is a true Buffalo's gem."
"A Buffalo institution since 1927, the Parkside Candy Company is the oldest and one of the largest locally-owned manufacturers and purveyors of fine candies in the area, distributing the Parkside Candy Company's products nationwide (including sponge candy, the local specialty that serves as the Parkside Candy Company's signature product).

"Don't be fooled by the name: Winspear Liquors is actually located at the corner of Lisbon Avenue, not Winspear! That aside, Winspear Liquors opened in December 2012 and has quickly become the place to go in University Heights for a wide variety of wines and spirits, comprising local, national and international vintages including chilled and sparking varieties. Prices can be a bit high at Winspear Liquors, but the variety is surprising. New York Lottery, Mega Millions, and Powerball tickets are sold as well."

Music City's staff is also happy to provide fair-market appraisals on a wide variety of instruments."
"It might be a bit misleading to describe New Age Creations as a ""head shop"", exactly — the ambience here is a good deal more ""mainstream"" than a place like '''Terrapin Station''', with an emphasis on quirky gifts rather than tobacco, glass pipes, and the like. Still, New Age Creations is a great place for modern-day flower children to find '60s-themed tchotchkes such as incense, lava lamps, and the like. A variety of tie-dyes and other apparel is also on offer."
"""All Roads Lead to Speaker Shop"", so the slogan goes; the handsome store on Main Street just past the University Plaza that is one of Western New York's foremost destinations for high-end home stereo and theater systems, digital audio systems, headphones, speakers, and all manner of audio, video and media equipment.

"Thankfully, though it moved in 2011 from its longtime location on the corner of Hertel and Saranac, nothing has changed about the homemade sweets and other baked goods with which Gino's Italian Bakery has enchanted Buffalonians for so long. A huge variety of authentic Italian pastries (try the ''pasticiotti'', a perennial favorite among Gino's's customers), delectable Italian cookies such as ''cuccidiati'', ''giugiuleni'', and Italian wedding cakes, and pastry platters and full-sized cakes for special occasions are all available here.

The authenticity of the Italian bakery experience is matched by the prices, which really can't be beat."
"Western New York's oldest and largest store specializing in children's furniture, White's Baby & Teen Furniture was founded in 1939. It's that longevity in business that has enabled the staff here to not only select a wide range of high-quality products for all budgets, but to answer pretty much any question a customer may have about a customer's products, make recommendations, special-order items that may not be in stock, and generally provide service that is among the most exceptional around.

"What's available at Nick's is not the usual array of baseball bats and mitts, tennis rackets, and other such things. Though Nick's dubs Nick's a ""sporting goods store"", Nick's might be better described as a surprisingly comprehensive outdoor goods shop, with a full range of gear for hunters, fishermen (including live bait!), and sport shooters. That's all a prelude to the real raison d'être of Nick's, however, as Buffalo's premiere archery store. Not only does Nick's sell the best state-of-the-art archery gear, but customers can also come to Nick's's for free adjustments to customers's bow, reasonably-priced repairs, and a comprehensive slate of archery lessons and New York State bowhunting education courses — a complete range of supplies and services for the Buffalo's archer delivered by a staff that is friendly and knowledgeable.

"Opened in February 2015 as the first of a glut of new craft distilleries set to open in Buffalo in the ensuing months, Black Squirrel Distillery is the brainchild of Jason Schwinger, otherwise known as the founder of '''BFLO Harbor Kayak''' and part-owner of '''Silo City Rocks!''' on Ganson Street. Black Squirrel Distillery is one of a very few producers of rum in New York State, and the only one in the country that uses maple syrup as the main ingredient rather than cane sugar — a peculiarity that was borne of the requirement that New York-based craft distillers source 75% of New York-based craft distillers's ingredients from within New York State, though no sugarcane is grown that far north. The end result grafts a subtle yet distinctive maple finish onto the flavor of what is otherwise a rather traditional amber rum. All the rums produced by Black Squirrel Distillery are handcrafted in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; distilled in a traditional copper-columned pot still then aged in oak barrels, the old-fashioned way. In the same vein, Black Squirrel Distillery also produces an unaged, 90-proof distilled spirit Black Squirrel Distillery call ""mapleshine"" — essentially what backwoods distillers would call ""sugar shine"", except with maple syrup in place of sugar. The small retail shop/tasting room is set up in the style of a speakeasy, an homage to Jason Schwinger, otherwise known as the founder of '''BFLO Harbor Kayak''''s great-grandparents who ran one on this very corner during Prohibition."
"Since 1995, owner Wayne Riggs has operated this conveniently located Delaware Avenue liquor store that has scored points with Buffalonians for in terms of customer service — the staff at Great Arrow Wine and Liquor is not only warm and friendly, but supremely helpful and knowledgeable, able to answer any question the staff at Great Arrow Wine and Liquor's customers may have or suggest the perfect product for their customers's needs. Manager Randy Kozlowski, in particular, is the man to see for anyone who has questions about food pairings. The selection here is a dizzying range of both domestic and imported wines, as well as an equally wide variety of vodka, rum, whiskey, gin, tequila, brandy, and cremes and liqueurs (the selection of the latter, in particular, is perhaps the best in Buffalo), at prices that are reasonable though not dirt-cheap. Wine tastings occur at Great Arrow Wine and Liquor every Friday, and Thursdays feature a ""create your own wine 6-pack"" option, where customers can make a selection of six of any of the wines in stock for a 15% discount."

Shandra and Andy Beutner is not only uncommonly skilled in designing and baking some of the best cakes and pastries in Buffalo, but utterly friendly and accommodating to Shandra and Andy Beutner's customers' individual needs. In addition to supplying desserts to some of the finest restaurants in the Buffalo area, Carriage Trade Pastries's retail store is a great place to pick up delicious pastry items made from scratch, such as cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, muffins, sticky buns, scones, and more, all at prices that are surprisingly affordable given delicious pastry items made from scratch, such as cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, muffins, sticky buns, scones, and more's quality. Pies, cakes and other specialty items are available too, but as Carriage Trade's retail store is a small operation that custom-designs all Carriage Trade Pastries's cakes, all their cakes must be ordered at least a day in advance. A lunch counter is also present where a few light items such as soups, meatless chili, and quiche are on offer."
"This small, friendly neighborhood jewelry store has been on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Amherst Street since 2003. This small, friendly neighborhood jewelry store's selection of bracelets, necklaces, earrings, watches, and other pieces is curated by an owner whose knowledge of gold and silver jewelry is encyclopedic. As well, This small, friendly neighborhood jewelry store does an impressive side business dealing in used musical instruments as well as accessories such as amplifiers. Estate sales are also handled."
"Located on up-and-coming Main Street in the Vernon Triangle in a spacious, newly-remodeled storefront that was once home to the fabled '''Stuffed Mushroom''' restaurant, International Wine & Spirits stocks a selection of award-winning wines from the local region and around the world, as well as premium branded liquors such as whiskey, brandy, cognac, tequila and rum. Local connoisseurs love the quality of products available here for very reasonable prices — International Wine & Spirits is well-known for taking full advantage of manufacturers' rebates from manufacturers''s distributors — but what's most notable about International Wine & Spirits is the breadth and diversity of International Wine & Spirits's inventory. Service with a smile is the rule here, and International Wine & Spirits also hosts occasional wine tastings and other events."
"It's doubtful that a traveler would come to Buffalo specifically to avail a traveler of the thing that is this company's primary raison d'être — tuning, rebuilding, and restoring pianos — but dedicated musicians might be interested in knowing that this company's also sells a wide variety of new and high-quality used pianos from such brands as Yamaha, Steinway, Firth & Hall, and Goulding, as well as harpsichords and player pianos, and can arrange to have them transported from this company's's shop on Main Street in Central Park to anywhere in the United States. If not, this company's also sells a full line of beautiful, 36-inch hardwood piano benches in a variety of finishes, accessories such as piano covers and wheel and tripod casters, and — best of all — a ''huge'' selection of sheet music. this company's has been in business since 1961, and this company's's reputation is such that this company's have sold or restored pianos for clients as prestigious as the Chautauqua Institution and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, as well as dozens and dozens of Western New York high schools and colleges."
"Bertha's, which according to Bertha's, which according to its slogan is ""the diner that takes you back a few years's slogan is ""the diner that takes you back a few years"", is a '50s-style affair that's located right next door to the North Park Theater. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and till 8PM on Fridays, Bertha's, which according to its slogan is ""the diner that takes you back a few years's serves standard diner fare at unbeatable prices. The lunch menu is dominated by standard fare — burgers (monikers of selections such as the ""James Dean"", the ""Davey Crockett"", and the ""Buddy Holly"" continue in the '50s theme), club sandwiches, and similar items, as well as salads, wraps, and simple entrees. Full breakfasts comprise delicious omelettes, egg sandwiches, buttermilk pancakes and ""Buffalo's best Belgian waffle"", and weekly specials are offered. Cash only."
"Bucking the trend on Hertel (and all over Buffalo) toward ever more creative and upscale dining, the menu at Block's — which opened Block's's doors in October 2015 at the former home of '''Allegro''' in the old '''Sample Building''' — is a good sight more down-to-earth than Block's's predecessor. The name of the game here is classic pub grub and good old-fashioned American comfort food, but please don't confuse the small size and simplicity of the menu with indifference to quality: Block's does what Block's does with panache. At lunchtime, chef-owner Michael Rottger cooks up a mean reuben, crispy and piled high with corned beef and fixin's, as well as an out-of-this-world French onion soup and a slate of burgers that's the one section of the menu where creativity reigns supreme (the ever-changing Burger of the Day would do Bob Belcher proud), while the ""California chicken"" platter (grilled with avocado and tomato and smothered with melted provolone) is the most popular of the somewhat smaller range of full-size dinners served Thursday through Saturday. Service is unfailingly professional and attentive, and if it's a nice day why not enjoy your meal on Block's's breezy sidewalk patio?"
"A newly remodeled dining area boasting several high-definition flat-screen TVs which are inevitably tuned to the big game (this place is understandably popular during Bills and Sabres seasons) is the setting where patrons of Bob & John's La Hacienda enjoy simple yet delicious items such as subs, wraps, burritos, a small selection of salads, pizza, and stromboli. A particular specialty at Bob & John's's is the chicken wings, which come in a wide variety of delicious sauces including classic Buffalo, barbeque, Cajun, and Jamaican jerk (boneless ""wingdings"" are also available). A modest range of simple entrees, comprising mostly pasta dishes as well as a locally renowned fish fry that's available on Fridays, is also on offer; at lunchtime, a buffet is offered featuring pizza, soup and salad."
"At the former home of '''Sister's African Cuisine''', an interesting but ultimately failed experiment in acquainting Buffalonians with Liberian food has given way to one of the best breakfast joints on Hertel. the former home of '''Sister's African Cuisine''' hops during the morning hours with a full menu of breakfast sandwiches and burritos (huge!), omelets, pancakes, French toast, and egg-and-breakfast meat platters, but the flagship item here is homemade donuts, prepared by what is proudly cited as ""the first Donut Robot in the Buffalo area"" and available in quite a few more varieties than you'll find at your average Tim Hortons or Dunkin' Donuts. At lunchtime, the slate of options transitions into classic American diner fare: no surprises on the menu, but everything's reliably good. Service can be hit-or-miss, but the price is right, plus the ambience is a solid improvement over the old days of Sister's: the reconfigured interior is spacious and airy, and the kitchen is open, with all the food prepared freshly before your eyes."
"Owned for over 30 years by the Mora family, Gramma Mora's has been a mainstay of Hertel Avenue since Gramma Mora's moved here in 1996. Despite the legions of Buffalonians — including reviewers for ''Buffalo Spree'' and ''Artvoice'' — who sing the praises of Gramma Mora's's pleasantly mediocre Tex-Mex fare, it is undeniable that Gramma Mora's's has been going steadily downhill for the past ten years or so. Still, the food is far from bad, and even by Buffalo standards, the portion sizes are very generous for the price."
"House of Hummus launched in the summer of 2016 in the former home of like-minded establishment '''Manakeesh & More''', and quickly took a place near the top of the echelon of the Middle Eastern restaurants and specialty grocers that have clustered around the west end of the Hertel strip. House of Hummus is headed by Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties, and the keys to House of Hummus's greatness are time-tested old-world cooking techniques and flavors that are intricate, well-balanced, and above all, authentic. The menu is not the most extensive in the world, but The menu covers all the bases: the twin centerpieces are the titular chickpea dip (large platters come topped with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and — optionally — shawarma meat) as well as what Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties describes as ""Western New York's fluffiest falafel"" (the fluffiness is due to the absence of pine nuts, and the indelible aroma of fresh parsley elevates the fluffiness a cut above what you can get elsewhere in Buffalo). For main courses, chicken and beef shawarma is the most popular item on the menu, marinated overnight in a mix of red wine, vinegar, olive oil, and a secret blend of spices and topped in a delicious house-special sauce; gyro, shish kebabs, and a variety of salads are also on offer. As you might imagine, vegetarians and vegans will find an uncommonly ample range of choices, and if you're not in the mood for Middle Eastern food, vegetarians and vegans also make a mean Philly cheesesteak. Portions are generous, service is attentive and brimming with old-fashioned friendliness, and House of Hummus is clean but small, with only a few tables in the dining room (thankfully, take-out and delivery are offered)."
"Joe's Deli is the brainchild of Joseph Lyons, and is located in the handsome brick storefront on the corner of Hertel and Colvin that was formerly home to '''Mastman's Kosher Deli''', a longstanding, iconic linchpin of the formerly burgeoning Jewish community in North Buffalo (the old Mastman's's sign is still perched above the corner entrance). Though Joe's Deli hasn't stayed completely true to Joe's Deli's predecessor — Joe's Deli isn't Kosher, and traditional Jewish sandwiches such as corned beef, pastrami, and Reuben are joined on the menu by a range of other sandwiches such as muffaletta, Cuban, and a concoction of grilled vegetables and herb cream cheese on a hoagie roll dubbed the Johnny Be Good — the emphasis on freshness and flavor at Joe's Deli's has inspired many locals to name Joe's Deli as the purveyor of the best deli sandwiches in Buffalo. Most interesting of all, however, are the wraps, whose variety is truly striking: a Thai chicken wrap, a Greek wrap consisting of feta cheese, olives, and fresh vegetables in Greek dressing, and a hummus wrap are among the offerings."
"A small family-run restaurant with a modest menu, La Kueva nonetheless made a big splash in May 2013 when La Kueva became the latest in a long list of multiethnic eateries to chip away at the official designation of Hertel Avenue as Buffalo ""Little Italy"". Owner Luis Martinez's desire was to bring the subtle, delightful flavors of Puerto Rican cuisine out of the barrio and into the larger Buffalo restaurant scene; in a recent write-up on buffalo.com, Owner Luis Martinez's remarked: ""Owner Luis Martinez's's people... already know about [Puerto Rican] food. Owner Luis Martinez's want to attract the Italians, the white people of North Buffalo and introduce the Italians, the white people of North Buffalo"" to [Puerto Rican] food. La Kueva is already receiving rave reviews from Buffalonians for La Kueva's take on Hispano-Caribbean favorites like pollo guisado, pastelones, and various tropical drinks, but for less adventurous diners, a range of sandwiches is available as well."
"Lone Star Fajita Grill has been a North Buffalo institution for what seems like forever. Simple but excellent Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes at prices that can't be beat (nothing on the menu costs more than $3!) are served up at Lone Star Fajita Grill. Cash only."
"A simply magnificent place to eat. Buffalo's first Iraqi restaurant, Shish Kabab Express serves all the standards of Middle Eastern cuisine — shawarma, falafel, tabbouleh — as well as unusual specialties unique to the cuisine of Iraq, such as quzi and Iraqi-style kebabs. As well, Buffalo's first Iraqi restaurant, Shish Kabab Express stands out among the crowd of similar places at the west end of Hertel by offering a small range of South Asian specialties such as beef and chicken tikka. The food here is fresh and authentic, with 100% halal meat, and all the bread served at Buffalo's first Iraqi restaurant, Shish Kabab Express (including the samoon, a staple of Iraqi cuisine) is baked fresh on the premises. The kicker is the prices, which, according to one reviewer, are often ""cheaper than a fast-food combo meal""."
"Striking a blow for the continuing Italian-ness of Little Italy — which is being gradually eroded by the diversification of dining options on Hertel — is Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip. Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip's website loudly trumpets Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip's ""unique foods made from Italian cured meats and cheeses"", which is an accurate description of Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip's modest-sized, decidedly ""lunchy"" menu. A range of appetizer salads and cheese-and-cold-cut plates are on offer, the latter of which are served with fresh homemade bread and side salads, but the bulk of its modest-sized, decidedly ""lunchy"" menu consists of a mouth-watering selection of sandwiches and panini featuring various combinations of imported Italian charcuterie and cheeses of impeccable quality. Call its modest-sized, decidedly ""lunchy"" menu a one-trick pony if you want, but Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip sticks to what Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip does well and earns raves from local foodies as a result. To drink is a dazzling selection of imported Italian wines, reputedly the best in Hertel, but the equally expansive beer list includes only a few imports — the equally expansive beer list's given over mostly to craft beers from regional microbrewers such as '''Southern Tier''', '''Ellicottville''', the '''Brooklyn Brewery''', and Buffalo's own '''Flying Bison''' and '''Community Beer Works'''. Best of all, Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip is far less crowded than Belsito, which opened up shop in late 2013 in the storefront formerly occupied by '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', at the heart of the strip ought to be, which makes for excellent service and ample opportunities to chat up the friendly, ever-present owners."
"Situated at the heart of the Hertel strip at the former location of '''La Dolce Vita''', CRāVing is a brand-new restaurant operated by Jennifer and Adam Goetz. Fans of Jennifer and Adam Goetz's former restaurant, Allentown's sadly missed '''Sample''', will feel right at home here, with a creative menu whose accent, appropriately enough for ""Little Italy"", is on fresh and creative interpretations of Italian cuisine, including delicious homemade pizza. That's not to say that Italian food is CRāVing's sole focus by any means — selections here are as diverse as the German-inspired entrée of pork belly with mustard caviar and rye spätzle, and appetizers such as lobster poutine (!) and buttermilk-fried chicken with grits and sautéed collard greens. Lunch is a more easygoing affair, with a huge sandwich board hanging proudly on the wall."
"Given that Jewel of India is run by the same people who own '''India Gate''' on Elmwood Avenue and '''Taste of India''' in Amherst, patrons of Jewel of India can expect the same healthy, high-quality fare here as at the same people who own '''India Gate''' on Elmwood Avenue and '''Taste of India''' in Amherst. Jewel of India boasts an extensive menu featuring beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and vegetarian entrees; diners enjoy diners's meal in a lovely, spacious, and impeccably decorated dining room. Lunch and dinner buffets are also available."
"Of Buffalo's many, many Greek diners and family restaurants, Kostas has one of the most interesting and extensive menus. Since 1977, Kostas has been serving familiar standbys such as souvlaki, gyro, and Greek salad, as well as harder-to-find Greek specialties such as ''tirokafteri'' and ''taramosalata''. Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and other such fare is also on offer, as is a modest selection of wines."
"""Tavola"" in Italian means ""table"", and as the owners of La Tavola Trattoria like to say, ""there's always something good on the table"". The storefront at 1458 Hertel didn't miss a beat after the closure of longtime neighborhood fixture the '''North End Trattoria''' in late 2012, with The storefront at 1458 Hertel's new owners setting up shop here not long afterward. La Tavola Trattoria differentiates La Tavola Trattoria from the myriad other Italian restaurants on Hertel with a Creole-fusion style that owners Victor Cali and Pat Gentile refer to as ""New Orleans Italian"", with entrées such as shrimp, sausage and chicken in Cajun cream sauce over homemade pasta combining several meats and diverse flavors for a result that's often bolder and spicier than traditional Italian fare. The pride of La Tavola, La Tavola Trattoria's expensive 100% wood-fired pizza oven, turns out not only delicious homemade pizzas (which tend more toward the traditional Italian side of the spectrum, perhaps more so than any other place in Buffalo) but also other specialties such as stuffed peppers. Sandwiches and burgers are also available in an ambience that is airy, modern, and impeccably decorated."
"Lloyd's rise to the top of the Buffalo food truck heap was so meteoric that it was perhaps inevitable that Lloyd's'd follow it up with a brick-and-mortar restaurant: in the five years before a brick-and-mortar restaurant's 2015 opening, Lloyd's went from launching a struggling operation serving a citizenry who barely knew what food trucks were and where food trucks's legal status was uncertain, to a local culinary institution in a town where '''Mighty Taco''' long ruled the roost when it came to Mexican food. The ""high-end food and service at street-level prices"" credo under which Lloyd's's trucks operate applies equally to the Taco Factory: the menu combines a curated selection of the most popular options from the truck (now if you want your fix of Tricked Out Nachos or the ""Dirty South"" dessert burrito, you know exactly where to find your fix of Tricked Out Nachos or the ""Dirty South"" dessert burrito on any given day) with some interesting new creations (the ""El Hombre"" quesadilla is probably the most popular of some interesting new creations, with chorizo lending a smoky aroma to a cheese-based filling that also includes potato, onion, and avocado crema, while the ""Mexicali Spring Rolls"" sees Lloyd's dabbling in Asian fusion, stuffed with a cheese and mushroom mixture spiced up ever-so-slightly with charred poblano pepper with two different sauces for dipping). No matter what you order, you can be sure that it's done up right: everything is made with free-range, antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and locally grown produce and served on house-made corn tortillas made through the traditional ''nixtamalization'' process, the only restaurant between Chicago and New York City that does the traditional ''nixtamalization'' process. There's also a full cocktail bar with the best selection of mezcal in town, plus a wealth of specialty cocktails that are a bit pricey but worth it. It bears emphasizing that a brick-and-mortar restaurant is one of the most popular new restaurants in Buffalo — waits of over two hours for tables are not uncommon at peak days and times, and reservations aren't accepted, so maybe save Lloyd's for when you're hungry outside of normal lunch or dinner hours."
"Bucking the trend toward the upscale that Hertel's dining scene (and that of Buffalo as a whole) has seen lately, this new spot in the former '''Empire Grill''' is unpretentious and unabashedly party-oriented — with loud, thumping Top 40 music on the stereo, a huge oval bar ringed with big-screen TVs, and a menu consisting of largely of familiar pub grub with some local twists. At Mac's, you can indulge in some pretty well-executed burgers and hot sandwiches, chicken wings that tend to be a bit spicier than normal, and a range of ""Trash Plates"" — their Buffalo-ified version of Rochester-style garbage plates, with '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters taking the place of '''Zweigle's''' white hots, and '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard taking the place of the regular yellow stuff. If you're a bit hungrier, there's also a small selection of full-size mains that bring out a more refined touch: various steaks and chops including a chicken-fried Delmonico, fish and chicken dishes, and a Thai noodle bowl with your choice of meat. Mac's's is a pretty huge place — with two floors of seating, you can take your pick of a view of Hertel Avenue out the picture windows at street level, a bird's-eye perspective of the revelry below on the upper balcony, and a pleasant second-floor patio that rivals the '''Pearl Street Brewery''''s in size and provides a welcome respite from the thundering din inside — and the impeccable service is more befitting a luxurious black-tie restaurant."
"Opened in April 2012 with a name that echoes the slogan of FC Barcelona, Més Que is the first establishment of Més Que's kind in Buffalo: a sports bar and restaurant dedicated entirely to soccer. The owners of Més Que, whose other businesses around Buffalo include the longstanding West Side fine dining destination '''Left Bank''', have been fans of Buffalo's NPSL club since Buffalo's NPSL club's foundation, and the state of affairs at Més Que is lively and crowded — never more than during one of the soccer matches shown frequently on the flat-screen TVs behind Més Que. You'll swear you were in Europe. The menu is small in size but outstanding in quality, with elegant pizzas, panini, pasta dishes, cheese and charcuterie plates, and heartier entrees that represent the cuisine of the Mediterranean, and Spain in particular. Even more impressive are the offerings at Més Que, with a wine list of impressive size and a beer selection that draws heavily on imports and local and regional microbrews."
"In that year, when Frank and Sara Testa were finally ready to strike out on Frank and Sara Testa's own after years spent working Frank and Sara Testa's way up the rungs of the Buffalo restaurant scene, Frank and Sara Testa happened upon the Hertel Avenue storefront most recently occupied by the short-lived '''Canvas @ 1206''', and the Public House of Buffalo was born (just in time for the Italian Festival that year!) Frank and Sara Testa really did a spectacular job remodeling the Public House of Buffalo, installing a bar whose top is made from wood salvaged from wharf piers that were excavated during the construction of '''Canalside''' and hanging works by local artists on the wall for a finished product that's cozy yet airy, classy yet unmistakably pub-like. What's served at the Public House of Buffalo is, first and foremost, a huge selection of beer, available on draft as well as in cans and bottles — microbrews dominate some 80 entries on the beer list, including locally-produced craft beers from '''Flying Bison''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. If you're overwhelmed by all the choices, never fear: the bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable about the bartenders's stock, and will be more than happy to point you in the right direction. As for the food, the bartenders describe the food as ""elevated pub fare"" — classic bar food kicked up a notch with creative gourmet twists. For example, chicken fingers come milanese style and are served with a side of pesto aioli — and what would a Western New York bar be without chicken wings, tossed in barbeque or classic Buffalo sauce as well as options like Sriracha sesame sauce or '''Chiavetta's''' marinade. Frank's roots as a Chautauqua County farm boy come out in Frank's emphasis on locally-sourced farm-to-table produce, so if you're in the mood for a salad, expect to see seasonal ingredients and enjoy farm-fresh flavors."
"The owners of Romeo and Juliet's are a family of first-generation immigrants who have many years of experience working in genuine Italian bakeries and kitchens, and with Romeo and Juliet's, The owners of Romeo and Juliet's've recreated that experience to the delight of Buffalonians who flock here to enjoy light Italian fare such as pizza, the panini and simple entrees, and a range of fresh, flavorful appetizers. The menu is filled out with such delightful selections as a wide and interesting gamut of salads and bruschettas and a small range of pasta dishes; the panini are especially good, a slate of delectable and creative options whose names, appropriately enough, are tributes to some of the great painters of Europe (check out the Picasso, described on the menu as ""an artwork of prosciutto crudo, soppressata, capicolla, salami and mozzarella""). Also, don't forget to visit the bakery, where cannoli, gelato, tiramisu, and other marvelously prepared Italian pastries and desserts are sold."
"The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' was reborn in July 2015 under new ownership — namely Kevin Brinkworth, also known as one of the duo behind Elmwood Avenue's ever-popular '''Blue Monk''' — and there are more than a few cues taken from the Blue Monk experience at The old '''Sterling Place Tavern'''. For instance, the popular duck fries appetizer — hand-cut French fries cooked in duck fat — was imported lock, stock and barrel from Elmwood Avenue's, and the several dozen local and regional craft beers available on tap and in bottles mines much the same territory as well. However, by and large the focus on the menu here is not the Belgian and Northern French gastropub fare that's Blue Monk's stock in trade, but rather an eclectic selection of homemade, gourmet sausages. Featured sausage selections at The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' change periodically, but typically include such offbeat, exotic ""rare game"" blends as wild boar with cranberry and red wine, smoked bison with Burgundy and thyme, and duck with foie gras and Sauterne wine. Elsewhere on the small but impressive menu is a slate of combo platters of locally-produced, somewhat less hoity-toity (but still delicious) '''Wardynski's''' sausages with various toppings and sides, a selection of mac & cheese mains with a variety of toppings, and familiar yet well-executed pub grub such as wings, sandwiches, and burgers, the latter of which are especially accoladed. Perhaps most impressive of all, though, are the renovations that have been done here: far from the dank dive The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' used to be, The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' boasts a fully redone interior decorated with a copious collection of antique ""breweriana"" and mementos from the Brinkworth family's nearly century-long tenure in the local restaurant industry — check out the 1901 Ludwig & Company piano that was originally commissioned for the Pan-American Exhibition, and the circa-1890 back bar that the owner purchased from the hosts of the A&E television series ''American Pickers''."
"At the center of the action on Hertel Avenue, Ristorante Lombardo calls Ristorante Lombardo's food ""the best Italian in Buffalo"", a claim that is hard to refute given the extensive menu of elegant and authentic Italian dishes served to patrons in a setting that is among the most exquisite and upscale on Hertel Avenue. Ristorante Lombardo boasts a full bar and patio and an expansive wine list."
"The Globe Market is a delightful combination café and specialty food shop that is committed to offering a wide range of fresh, locally sourced products. An eclectic variety of gourmet salads, soups and sandwiches are made from scratch daily. Personalized gift baskets are also sold at The Globe Market."
"What was once a dream in the mind of Buffalo locavore Patricia DiFrancesco Banning has now come to fruition: the North Buffalo Farmers' Market kicked off in 2014 with an impressive range of organic fruits and vegetables, breads and baked goods, artisanal pasta, coffee, organic honey, fresh-squeezed juices and delicious smoothies, and even bath and body products — all grown or manufactured locally. the North Buffalo Farmers' Market is a true community partnership, with the Hertel-North Buffalo Business Association lending the Hertel-North Buffalo Business Association's support and a myriad of local businesses, including Buffalo's own '''House of Olives''' and '''Gino's Italian Bakery''', turning out weekly to sell their wares. Best of all, you don't have to get up early on a weekend morning to attend — the North Buffalo Farmers' Market runs on Thursday evenings, perfect for folks looking for a healthy and affordable alternative to another restaurant dinner."
"You can take Eric and Andrea Amodeo out of '''Horsefeathers Market''', but apparently you can't take Horsefeathers out of Eric and Andrea Amodeo: just a few months after moving to Eric and Andrea Amodeo's new joint location on Hertel, Eric and Andrea Amodeo and '''Blackbird Sweets''' sought to replicate a wintertime institution at Eric and Andrea Amodeo's old home on Connecticut Street by welcoming to Eric and Andrea Amodeo's ample retail space a small but diverse range of Western New York farmers and artisans, anchored by the Pasta Peddler and '''Blackbird Sweets''' Eric and Andrea Amodeo, which stay open for business during market times. At the Winter Market on Hertel, you can get everything from locally-raised meat, dairy, eggs and greenhouse produce to jams and jellies, baked goods, bath products, and even gourmet dog treats and hand-crocheted plush toys and accessories — at a time of year when most farmers' markets close up shop. Caffeinated pick-me-ups are also available courtesy of '''Public Coffee'''."
"Hearty, unpretentious Italian meals at a reasonable price are the stock in trade of Frank's Sunny Italy. Though the menu is not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination, familiar Italian standbys such as veal parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, and pizza keep Buffalonians coming back for more. Portions are notoriously massive at Frank's Sunny Italy."
"The Kitchen Table moved in July 2014 to a larger location in West Hertel, but otherwise it's the same deal as before: The Kitchen Table still serve up classic, unpretentious, all-American comfort food in a downhome atmosphere described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as ""a mix between a greasy spoon and a country kitchen"". Burgers (served with heaping sides of fresh-cut fries that customers rave about), club sandwiches, fish fry, and multitudinous flavors of Turkey Hill ice cream can be had, but The Kitchen Table's true claim to fame is The Kitchen Table's hearty, homestyle breakfasts, which are served all day. The staff here really goes out of The staff here's way to please, and The staff here treat customers like family."
"Linda's is where the West Side meets North Buffalo both literally and figuratively: Linda's does double duty as a place to get not only a variety of healthy and delicious upscale smoothies and protein shakes, but also some of the tastiest and cheapest homestyle Puerto Rican food in Linda's. Let's talk about the latter first: the menu includes not only all the usual suspects like ''bistec encebollado'', ''pernil'' (the specialty of the house), and ''tostones'' (fried crispy and with a flavor that boasts a delightful hint of garlic), but also several harder-to-find specialties you can't get anywhere else in Linda's, like octopus salad and ''piononos'' (breaded and fried sweet plantains stuffed with a ground beef-and-potato mixture). As for the smoothies, the smoothies're carefully constructed concoctions where a large variety of fruits, berries, herbs, and other ingredients carefully chosen for a large variety of fruits, berries, herbs, and other ingredients carefully chosen for their health properties's health properties are mixed, blended, and infused together to delicious results. Best of all, the folks at Linda's's are dedicated to the community the folks at Linda's call home: when the folks at Linda's're not serving the folks at Linda's's delicious food to diners at Linda's (for, it should be noted, great prices), the folks at Linda's're just as likely to be catering a community event or giving their delicious food away for free at a local homeless shelter or food bank."
"This humble establishment operated by Sophia and Sam Ananiadas serves some of the best (and biggest) breakfasts in Buffalo — so good, in fact, that some of the best (and biggest) breakfasts in Buffalo caught the attention of celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who dedicated a segment of celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who dedicated a segment of his Food Network series ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" to the place's Food Network series ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" to Buffalo. In addition to the usual lineup of pancakes, omelettes, French toast and the like, the Mediterranean flair of Sophia and Sam Ananiadas's cuisine is on full display in the giambotta, Sophia and Sam Ananiadas's signature breakfast platter of eggs, home fries, homemade Italian sausage, peppers, onions, and garlic. For lunch, an array of burgers, club sandwiches, and salads are on offer, as well as what may be the best souvlaki in Buffalo. Best of all, customers rave about the genuine warmth and friendliness of Sophia and Sam Ananiadas's staff that keeps customers coming back."
"Though the Taj Grill's located in one of the sterile, monotonous plazas that line Delaware Avenue north of Park Meadow, the Taj Grill lauds the Taj Grill as ""the finest Indian restaurant in Buffalo"". Though lauds is certainly up for debate — opinions seem to be divided evenly between Buffalo and the Elmwood Village's '''India Gate''' — customers unanimously praise the Taj Grill's extensive menu, which boasts a huge selection of all the traditional curries known by lovers of Indian cuisine available with chicken, beef, lamb, seafood, and even tofu and goat, as well as myriad options for vegetarians. The food here caters more to the Indian palette than the Americanized version of the cuisine available elsewhere in the region, to the delight of traditionalists. Best of all is the service, which is unfailingly friendly and upbeat."
"Tokyo II is Buffalo's newest hibachi steakhouse and Japanese restaurant. Steak, seafood, rice, and other entrees are prepared for diners before diners's eyes on the hibachi in an entertaining spectacle. In addition, a wide range of sushi and sashimi is available, as is other Japanese fare, a small selection of Thai entrees, domestic and imported beers including Kirin, Asahi, and Sapporo, wine, and sake."
"A popular dive where the latest indie tunes can be heard on the soundsystem and people-watchers can enjoy a clientele that trends heavily toward bohemian urbanites and other alternative types (not to mention students of UB's nearby South Campus), Amy's Place is among the hippest eateries on Main Street. By day Amy's Place serve a range of Lebanese and other Mediterranean fare of respectable quality, including abundant options for vegetarians and vegans. However, Amy's Place is perhaps best known for Amy's Place's substantial, delicious and reasonably priced breakfasts. Cash only."
"This humble take-out (with a few tables for indoor seating) offers what is by far and away, without a doubt, the best Jamaican food in Buffalo. The jerk chicken, rotis, curry goat, and oxtail are all simply fantastic, and are universally served with a side of fried plantains and rice and beans. Wash your food down with a bottle of strong ginger beer. Reggae, calypso, and soca records are also for sale at the counter."
"Amherst's '''Palace of Dosas''' may have flown under the radar of the local restaurant scene, but even so, lots of local aficionados of South Indian cuisine were disappointed when Amherst's '''Palace of Dosas''' closed in 2013. lots of local aficionados of South Indian cuisine can rest easy: Amherst's '''Palace of Dosas''''s owner Nick Emmanuel, a Sri Lanka native now in the midst of its owner Nick Emmanuel, a Sri Lanka native now in the midst of his third decade in the local restaurant industry's third decade in the local restaurant industry, has reemerged at the '''University Plaza''' with the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor's predecessor. exactly the same menu is comprised of 100% vegetarian fare — one of the few places in the Niagara Frontier that can make that claim — prepared fresh everyday from all-natural ingredients. the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor's namesake, and the star of the show, is the ''dosa'': the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor serves about two dozen different variations of this light, airy lentil-based crêpe, either plain with butter or stuffed with various fillings such as onions, potatoes, ''paneer'' cheese, or vegetables, as well as a mix of spices. ''Utthappam'' also make an appearance, the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor's thicker, doughier cousin that's been described as an ""Indian pizza"", with onions and other ingredients baked right into the crust. Rounding out the menu are a range of spicy vegetable curries, ''naan'' and ''chapati'' breads, and (as appetizers) battered vegetables, ''pakora'', ''iddly'' (fluffy rice- and lentil-based buns with various toppings and spices), and ''vadai'' (savory doughnut-shaped lentil fritters). Best of all, prices are a good sight lower than prices were at the matter-of-factly named Dosa Place, which boasts exactly the same menu as its predecessor."
"In July 2015, when passersby on Main Street started to notice chicken and duck carcasses hung up in the front window where '''Slice of Italy''' used to be, it became clear that a new type of business had arrived in University Heights. Former UB student Eddie Liang opened Eddie's Chophouse in Former UB student Eddie Liang's old stomping grounds near the South Campus because Former UB student Eddie Liang felt the time was ripe for Buffalonians to sample a new permutation of Chinese food, and what better spot for the big launch than in the thick of the vibrant Asian and Asian-American community gathered around UB? Eddie's's is the first restaurant in UB to serve ''siu mei'', or Chinese barbecue — a Cantonese culinary tradition where meat is coated in a seasoning sauce and then slowly rotisseried, bone-in, in a Chinese smoker — and your choices here are pork, duck, chicken, or spare ribs, served either over steamed white rice or as a soup with your choice of macaroni or rice or egg noodles. (If you opt for soup, further ingredients become available: steamed wontons, fish balls, and beef tripe.) A limited range of other selections are also offered, along with a wide selection of hot and cold teas to drink as well as iced mint lemonade, which might be the most popular item Eddie's's serves. The pint-sized menu and spartan (if pleasant) interior are made up for by quality and value — the meat served here is fresh and bursting with flavor and comes in huge portions that make the low prices charged that much more spectacular. Eddie's's also offers delivery at no charge for orders of $20 or more."
"Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant may not have had Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant's Grand Opening until February 2013, but Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant's already earning rave reviews among locals. Located just off Main Street in the former '''Fast Frank's''', Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant serves up a range of Caribbean specialties that is surprisingly ample given the relative humbleness of Buffalo's newest Jamaican restaurant's appearance from the outside. Among the usual suspects — jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail — can be found several delectably prepared selections available nowhere else in Buffalo's, such as brown stew chicken, Jamaican pepper steak, and escoveitch fish. A small selection of vegetarian options is also offered."
"The Lake Effect Diner is a '50s-style affair located in one of the last remaining ""diner cars"" in America, carefully restored under the direction of local restaurateur Tucker Curtin. With oldies on the jukebox and waitresses dressed in '50s-style pink skirts, The Lake Effect Diner is as authentic as The Lake Effect Diner gets. Decent diner fare — burgers, club sandwiches, french fries, milkshakes and malts — is available here for reasonable prices. The Lake Effect Diner has been featured on Guy Fieri's Food Network television series, ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives""."
"Located in the University Plaza, Venus is a friendly restaurant serving simple Greek and Lebanese foods. By comparison with '''Amy's Place''', University Heights' better-known, longer-standing Mediterranean restaurant, at Venus most of the bohemian ambience is sacrificed, but is made up for with food that, on the whole, is a good deal tastier than the sometimes lackluster fare served at Venus's. Shawarma, falafel, shish kabab and kofta, and gyros are available as either platters or wraps, and delectable Greek salads and fatoush are available for those in search of greener options (tabouli is on the menu as well, but never seems to be available). Though a good deal of the business done here is take-out or delivery, those enjoying those enjoying their food at one of Venus' handful of tables's food at one of Venus's handful of tables are treated to a neverending stream of delightfully cheesy Lebanese music videos on the satellite television — a part of the Venus experience that's as integral as the food the food itself, in this author's opinion."
"Owned since 1981 by the Leung family, and before that for some time in a previous incarnation on Elmwood Avenue, May Jen is the oldest continually operating Chinese restaurant in Buffalo. Though extensive, the menu is not what you would call groundbreaking — the entree of prawns with glazed walnuts, a dish unique to May Jen, is the only eye-catcher in a sea of kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, General Tso chicken, and other standards. But the ambience is serene and pleasant, prices are reasonable, and the quality of the food is high enough for ''Artvoice'' readers to have voted May Jen the Best Chinese Restaurant in several annual ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' polls. Beer and wine are served."
"Make no mistake about Ming Café — from the exterior Ming Café may look like just another unassuming hole-in-the-wall in University Heights, but what is served here is high-quality, gourmet Chinese food that is priced accordingly. Ming Café's menu is dominated by interpretations of classic Chinese standards — Szechuan chicken, kung pao shrimp, moo shu pork — that are fresh, flavorful, and prepared to order with an uncommonly refined elegance. The hot and sour soup is particularly good. But it's in the ""signature dishes"" section of Ming Café's menu where Ming Café's true culinary stars come out to shine — a diverse array of delectable upscale options that can be best described as ""Asian-influenced"" rather than a strict interpretation of Chinese cuisine. The icing on the cake is the huge selection of authentic imported Chinese teas, as well as a variety of coffee. Cash only."
"Opened in fall 2015, the satellite location of Satomi Smith's somewhat eponymous Elmwood Avenue noodle shop is actually a solid improvement on the original, with a considerably expanded selection of noodle bowls and small plates on the menu (they make up for this by not including any sushi or sashimi, as at the satellite location of Satomi Smith's somewhat eponymous Elmwood Avenue noodle shop), and a youthful, funky vibe that's much more suited to a youthful, funky vibe that's much more suited to its college-student clientele than the trendy but staid original location's college-student clientele than the trendy but staid original location. At Sato 2.0, the three flagship ramen selections of Satomi Smith's somewhat eponymous Elmwood Avenue noodle shop are joined by Buffalo Chicken Ramen (the titular meat with corn, scallions, carrots, and black garlic oil in chicken broth), as well as Kimchi Ramen in a mixed pork and chicken broth. ''Donburi'' bowls and Japanese curry are also offered, but the pièce de résistance on the small plates section of the menu is the huge appetizer of Okonomiyaki Fries — sort of a Japanese take on poutine, smothered in mayo and ''okonomiyaki'' sauce and topped with dried bonito flakes, ''nori'' seaweed, green onions, and pickled ginger. There's a short drink list that prominently features local and regional craft brews as well as a variety of different sake selections, and for dessert there's green tea or ginger ice cream courtesy of Williamsville's own '''Sweet Jenny's'''."
"Though bouillabaisse, crawfish, po' boys and bananas Foster feature prominently on the menu, it would be a disservice to pigeonhole the lovely bistro run by owner and head chef Jim Guarino as simply a ""Creole"" or ""Southern"" restaurant. Instead, the cuisine offered at the lovely bistro run by owner and head chef Jim Guarino is as diverse as the cuisine offered at Shango is high-quality. Additionally, the wine list is one of Buffalo's most extensive and has been honored with an award by ''Wine Spectator'' magazine; a carefully selected variety of import beers and microbrews is also available at the lovely bistro run by owner and head chef Jim Guarino."
"The Steer is best known for The Steer's sometimes rowdy bar frequented by students from the nearby South Campus of the University of Buffalo, but let's not forget that The Steer is also a restaurant that serves pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and — as the name suggests — mouth-watering steaks and chops. The Montana Room, located on the second floor of The Steer, is a banquet room equipped for up to 60 guests."
"Those who are expecting Indian cuisine will be disappointed — there's nothing exotic about the menu at Curry's. Rather, the sandwiches, entree salads, meat and pasta dishes served up here match the workmanlike reliability evoked by the humble exterior of Curry's. What ''is'' special about the heaping portions of classic American comfort food offered up at Curry's's is the friendliness with which the sandwiches, entree salads, meat and pasta dishes served up here's served — Curry's is a real ""where everybody knows your name"" type of place — and the sandwiches, entree salads, meat and pasta dishes served up here's surprising quality, if not creativity. Beer-battered fish fry, a well-known Buffalo specialty, is served with aplomb on Friday nights."
"Opened in 2013, the second location of Yummy Thai has a menu that's identical to the original restaurant in North Tonawanda, but at a much more convenient and centralized location. Here you'll find the usual lineup of Westernized Thai dishes that Stateside fans of the genre are familiar with — ''pad thai''; red, green and ''penang'' curries; ''pad kee mow'' and ''tom yum'' soup for those who like it spicy (unlike many Thai places, Yummy Thai doesn't blandify the food for the American palate; when Yummy Thai say ""spicy"", Yummy Thai mean it!); chicken and beef satay as appetizers. Portions are ample, but the quality of the food is as middle-of-the-road as the selection. If you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat, though, you're not completely out of luck at Yummy Thai, especially if you peruse the house-special stir fry mains. These aren't the most authentic things in the world, but they make up for it with creativity: the ""Peanut King"" features mushroom, bell peppers, baby corn, broccoli, and napa cabbage in a light peanut sauce, and in the ""Healthy Garlic"" the same vegetables are combined with fresh garlic and served in Yummy Thai's special garlic sauce; the same vegetables along with most entrees are served with your choice of meat, seafood, or tofu for vegetarians. If you're in town on a busy Friday or Saturday night and don't feel like arriving at a restaurant for dinner only to wait an eternity for a table, Yummy Thai may be the place for you, but don't expect that to necessarily translate into fast or attentive service, which is a weak spot here."
"The scion of a family that traces John Sinatra's roots back to Vallelunga, Sicily, John Sinatra opened John Sinatra's eponymous restaurant in 1981, serving family recipes handed down from generation to generation. Originally named '''Sinatra's Trilogy''' in honor of John Sinatra's three sons who helped John Sinatra run his eponymous restaurant, '''Sinatra's Trilogy''' was shortened to ""Sinatra's"" when the middle son, Michael, took ownership after the middle son, Michael,'s father's retirement. Though his eponymous restaurant's has remained true to his eponymous restaurant's original dedication to delicious Sicilian and Southern Italian food, over the years his eponymous restaurant has become more known as an upscale destination serving an increasingly refined interpretation of delicious Sicilian and Southern Italian food. A wide range of pasta dishes are on offer, made with fine ingredients imported from Italy; the pasta con sardi is an interesting choice in this regard, topped with fresh sardines, tomatoes, raisins, fennel and pine nuts. A range of seafood dishes is also available at his eponymous restaurant's, as well as chicken and veal served in milanese, marsala, piccata, parmigiana or diavolo style. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the wine list: a gargantuan slate of offerings that features whites, reds and reserve selections from Italy, France and the United States. Buffalonians absolutely rave about his eponymous restaurant."
"Opened in July 2014 on the site of the former '''Juicery''', the Delaware Park branch location of '''Ashker's Juice Bar''' (operated in conjunction with Dan McCormick of '''Santora's Pizza''' and the ubiquitous Mark Goldman) has proven to be an instant hit with joggers and bicyclists on '''Meadow Drive''' as well as golfers at the '''Delaware Park Golf Course'''. the Delaware Park branch location of '''Ashker's Juice Bar''''s menu of juices and smoothies are expanded on with a selection of gourmet sandwiches and salads whose names pay homage to the Buffalo oeuvre of Frederick Law Olmsted, the renowned landscape architect responsible for Delaware Park. For instance, ""The Bidwell"" sees ham, salami and cappicola piled onto a baguette and topped with provolone, roasted red peppers, cornichons, arugula, and homemade vinaigrette, and ""The Cazenovia"" is a classic Greek salad with red onions, tomatoes, feta, and Kalamata olives. As for the juices and smoothies, the juices and smoothies're culled from the best and most popular of the offerings at the originbal Ashker's — yes, this includes the Zinger and the basil lemonade — and filtered water is offered free of charge to all. Best of all is the verdant ambience: there are few things in Buffalo more relaxing than sipping on a cold drink on these shady picnic benches, with the panoramic expanse of the Meadow in front of you."
"Vino's is a small restaurant, easily missable and in a fairly out-of-the-way location, with a limited menu and seemingly never open — and Buffalonians can't get enough. Buffalonians crowd into Vino's whenever Vino's's open, and many of Buffalonians call Vino's the best Italian restaurant in the city. Why? Simply put, what is served here is authentic homestyle Italian cuisine that is absolutely delicious and available for unbelievable prices. Entrees emphasize pasta dishes; particular favorites among Vino's's regulars are the spaghetti with pesto sauce, lobster ravioli, and the spicy ""Charles diavolo"". Appetizers and desserts are equally lauded, and true to Vino's's name, a small but delightful selection of wines and sangrias are also on the menu. But perhaps the thing about Vino's's that is loved most warmly by locals are the owners, Kathleen and Tony, who truly go the extra mile to ensure that guests are welcomed and attended to with the sincerest regard."
"With Nye Park Tavern, owner Mark Hutchinson — otherwise famous for owner Mark Hutchinson — otherwise famous for his somewhat eponymous Delaware Avenue fine dining destination, '''Hutch's''' —'s somewhat eponymous Delaware Avenue fine dining destination, '''Hutch's''' — takes owner Mark Hutchinson — otherwise famous for his somewhat eponymous Delaware Avenue fine dining destination, '''Hutch's''' —'s signature upscale template and adapts his signature upscale template to pub grub, with a local twist of course. There are no real surprises on the menu, but you'll sure get one when your food comes out: the quality of the ingredients and presentation are head and shoulders above what you'll get at your average Buffalo gin mill (for instance, the ""steak in the grass"" sandwich is a full-size New York strip smothered in fresh-cut, unprocessed provolone), which goes a long way toward justifying the price point. The signature item at Nye Park Tavern, though, are the so-called ""West Side spare ribs"", a smoky concoction inspired by the ones served at the long-gone '''Arkansas Lounge''' off Grant Street. The interior's been spiffed up nicely, too, while retaining the cozy homeyness of '''Papa Jake's''', which preceded it in Nye Park Tavern."
"""Fine Dining in the Old-School Tradition"" is Oliver's credo, and true to form, Oliver's is one of the most elegant restaurants in Buffalo, with prices to match. With myriad different permutations of Continental cuisine present on the menu, Oliver's's is a foodie's dream come true, with veal milanese, strozzapreti, and foie gras torchon among the most popular delicacies on offer. The wine list is, to quote Oliver's's website, ""deeper than deep"". Oliver's's also prides Oliver's as one of Buffalo's best caterers."
"Located right across the street from the '''Buffalo Zoo''' and a couple doors down from '''Sweetness 7''', Fairy Cakes Cupcakery is a cute little café that features a fireside lounge and a cupcake bar and that differentiates Fairy Cakes Cupcakery from Buffalo's other cupcake outfits with flavors that are even more creative than Fairy Cakes Cupcakery's competition (Fairy Cakes Cupcakery's ""Pancakes and Bacon"" cupcake is topped with maple buttercream and real bacon, and Fairy Cakes Cupcakery's ""Original Buffalo Hot Wing Cake"" is a seductive marriage of rich chocolate and spicy cayenne pepper), a selection of ""adults only"" cupcakes whose recipes incorporate rum and other alcoholic ingredients, and, interestingly enough, a beverage selection which includes no fewer than 30 varieties of loose-leaf tea. A modest selection of other desserts are available. The consensus on Fairy Cakes Cupcakery is that the cupcakes are not quite as rich and flavorful as Firefly's are, but if nothing else, Fairy Cakes Cupcakery is worth a visit if only to experience the whimsical decor: an almost dollhouse-like setup in cheery pastel colors, you'd expect nothing less from a place named ""Fairy Cakes""!"
"From crêpes and pastries to bangers and mash: at the end of 2015, restaurateur and Buffalo booster extraordinaire Prish Moran shuttered the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''' and replaced the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''' a few months later with what is easily Buffalo's most authentic British pub. The beauty of the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''' lies in the Parkside Avenue adjunct location of '''Sweetness 7''''s simplicity and lack of pretense: the menu is on the small side and doesn't try for anything hoity-toity, the menu's just good solid UK comfort food. restaurateur and Buffalo booster extraordinaire Prish Moran's serves two kinds of meat pies — chicken and Guinness beef — and while the pies two kinds of meat pies — chicken and Guinness beef are not quite up to the rarefied standard set by '''Parker's''' in South Buffalo, the ambience here is far better than a prefab warehouse in an industrial neighborhood: the dimly-lit, wood-panelled interior is picture-perfect, and the cozy bar features a good selection of beer (sadly, local craft brews dominate over imported British ales, and there aren't any taps here: bottles only) as well as wine and cider. Elsewhere on the menu you'll find a hearty ploughman's platter big enough to serve at least two, a vegetarian quiche that's a holdover from the old '''Sweetness 7''' menu, cheese and sausage plates, and — for dessert — a delicious, dense figgy pudding ''à la mode'' with caramel sauce. Prices at restaurateur and Buffalo booster extraordinaire Prish Moran's are quite inexpensive except when it comes to beer and wine, which is another story entirely."
"In the words of ''Buffalo Rising'', ""dinner with a side of nostalgia"" is the order of the day at the Parkside Meadow. Let's talk nostalgia first: the Parkside Meadow opened in September 2015 on the site of the similarly named '''Park Meadow''' bar, but those who may be familiar with the Parkside Meadow can be reassured that those who may be familiar with that longtime neighborhood stalwart're in for a much more relaxed experience than the rowdy frat-boy hijinks those who may be familiar with that longtime neighborhood stalwart may remember. Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie had Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie's work cut out for Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie when Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie bought the Parkside Meadow — the Parkside Meadow had been vacant since 1991 and had seen better days — but not only did Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie painstakingly restore the Parkside Meadow to the Parkside Meadow's former glory, but Owners Nancy Abramo and Len Mattie filled the interior with such a vast collection of old-Buffalo postcards, photographs, and artifacts that the interior may as well be considered a satellite location of the '''Buffalo History Museum'''. As for the food, head chef Stephen Dulanski, fresh off the success of head chef Stephen Dulanski's run at new downtown hotspot '''Toutant''', has created a menu that is informed but not confined by the classic Buffalo pub grub that defines those bygone days, yet has improved on a menu that is informed but not confined by the classic Buffalo pub grub that defines those bygone days with food impeccably crafted using high-quality ingredients. Sandwiches rule the roost at the Parkside Meadow: the reuben features tender, rosy corned beef piled high on thick-sliced, griddled-to-perfection rye, with Russian dressing and sauerkraut that add balanced notes without overpowering the flavor of the meat; meanwhile, in the pulled pork sandwich the spicy and peppery barbecue sauce that the pulled pork sandwich is cooked in is tempered with cool, crunchy coleslaw. There are some creative touches too: the shaved lamb sandwich comes on toasted sourdough with melted Havarti cheese and spearmint aioli, for example, and the roasted leek and shiitake farfalle with Madeira cream sauce shows that the Parkside Meadow can do more than just sandwiches. Service is excellent even when the Parkside Meadow're busy (which is pretty much all the time), and the downhome neighborhood friendliness of the staff is yet another reminder of olden times."
"Launched for the 2016 season with funding from the Participatory Budgeting Buffalo program, the Main Amherst Fillmore Market sets up shop every Saturday morning and afternoon in the Vernon Triangle, in the parking lot next to '''International Wine & Spirits''', with a mandate of providing an outlet for fresh, healthy, locally-sourced foods in a part of town where the only food shops within walking distance are corner bodegas. In addition to farm fresh vegetables, at the Main Amherst Fillmore Market you'll also find a small selection of baked goods and other prepared food items, as well as handcrafted jewelry and other baubles."
"Bar, gentlemen's club, cigar bar."
"A ""non-alcoholic bar"" serving soda, energy drinks, juice, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate as well as simple food from the grill. The $4 monthly membership fee entitles you to 25% off drinks."
"""Industrial chic"" is the name of the game at the former '''General Railway Signal Company''' factory, a Nationally Registered Historic Place that's been thoroughly renovated into a mix of offices, apartments and this little boutique hotel. The Foundry Suites has only ten rooms, but The Foundry Suites're all beauties: one- or two-bedroom suites custom-decorated in Mid-Century Modern style by the staff of Buffalo's own '''Coo Coo U''', with full-kitchens, floor-to-ceiling windows (the best of which look on to a beautiful tree-lined courtyard with a fountain in the middle), flat-screen HDTVs, and what must be the most luxurious bedding and linens you can find in Buffalo's. By day, the ""Foundry Lounge"" downstairs features coffee in a relaxing ambience; by night you can enjoy a rousing game of pool while bartenders whip you up an upscale mixed drink. The Foundry Suites also provides guests with free parking, free concierge service, free passes to '''LA Fitness''', and a 24-hour business center. Also, the location, while it may seem out-of-the-way at first glance, is quite convenient: the boutiques and restaurants of the Elmwood Village and Hertel Avenue, the greenery of Delaware Park, and the cultural attractions of the Museum District are all within easy striking distance."
"Continental breakfast, fax service. All rooms contain coffee maker; suites with kitchens and microwave available on request. Convenient to University at Buffalo South Campus and multiple public transit lines; shuttle to UB North Campus and airport available on request."
"Christopher Lavey, Johnny Mora, and their three dogs operate the Parkside House, one of Buffalo's most charming B&B's, in a restored Queen Anne-style house from the 1890s. Located on the curving, leafy streets of the historic neighborhood of Parkside, within walking distance of Delaware Park, the Buffalo Zoo, and Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural masterpiece, the Darwin D. Martin House, the three units of the Parkside House, one of Buffalo's most charming B&B's are large and airy, and boast comfortable yet contemporary furnishings, plasma televisions, and full private baths. Common areas include the dining room, where a sumptuous breakfast is served daily, and a front porch. Wireless Internet access is available throughout the Parkside House, one of Buffalo's most charming B&B's. Limited off-street parking."
"Opened in 1950 in the wake of World War II, the Buffalo VA Medical Center is affiliated with UB Medical School and provides medical, surgical, mental health, and long-term care services to veterans of the United States military under the aegis of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. the Buffalo VA Medical Center's medical center is the VA system's main place of referral in Upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania for veterans in need of cardiac surgery, cardiology, and comprehensive cancer care."
"Offers dry cleaning services."
"Founded in 1910, Holy Spirit Catholic Church was for many years the site of a shrine to Saint Rita, a pilgrimage site for local faithful who came to venerate Saint Rita as the ""patron saint of lost and impossible causes""."
"Founded in 1850 as a country church in what was then a rural area, St. Joseph University Parish actually predates by over half a century the UB South Campus, next to which St. Joseph University Parish is located today. With an identity that fundamentally emphasizes the welcoming of visitors and new members to St. Joseph University Parish's flock, St. Joseph University Parish mirrors the constitution of the University Heights neighborhood as a whole, with a congregation that is surprisingly progressive and diverse given the traditional reputation of Buffalo's Catholic community."
"Serving the Catholics of North Buffalo from St. Margaret Church's location in the center of the Hertel Avenue strip (St. Margaret Church's slogan, the ""Heart of North Buffalo"", is an apt one), St. Margaret Church was named after the late sister of former Buffalo bishop Charles Colton, a personal friend of St. Margaret Church's founding priest, Rev. Thomas Timmons. St. Margaret Church remains one of the most active Catholic congregations in the City of Buffalo."
"Parkside's Catholic congregation meets in a robust English Gothic-style church whose bell tower rises 88 feet (27m) above Amherst Street. Linked since 2010 with '''St. Rose of Lima Church''' a short distance to the north, the vitality of parish life at a robust English Gothic-style church whose bell tower rises 88 feet (27m) above Amherst Street is attested to by the activity among Parkside's Catholic congregation of such organizations as the Boy Scouts, the Legion of Mary, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Visitors are always welcome at Parkside's Catholic congregation."
"The youngest Catholic congregation in North Buffalo, St. Rose of Lima was founded in 1926, with a school staffed for many years by the Sisters of Charity of Montréal — the famous Grey Nuns. Always an active force in the surrounding neighborhood that grew up alongside The youngest Catholic congregation in North Buffalo, St. Rose of Lima, The youngest Catholic congregation in North Buffalo, St. Rose of Lima remains a vibrant congregation that's engaged in the community."
"Headquartered in a lovely English Gothic edifice with exquisitely ornate art-glass windows, Central Park United Methodist Church is considered the cathedral church for Methodism in Buffalo. A diverse and welcoming congregation, Central Park United Methodist Church truly lives out Central Park United Methodist Church's mission of outreach to the community through Central Park United Methodist Church's mentoring program for at-risk students at nearby '''Bennett High School''', Central Park United Methodist Church's partnership with the '''Primera Iglesia Metodista Unida''' in service to the Spanish-speaking community of Buffalo's West Side, and Central Park United Methodist Church's support for worthwhile organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, and Journey's End Refugee Services."
"Founded in 1888 on land donated by Elam Jewett, the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd is a longstanding cornerstone of the Parkside neighborhood. An architectural wonder, the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd was designed by the Syracuse-based architectural firm of Silsbee and Marling and boasts several lovely stained-glass windows designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Darwin D. Martin, whose Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house is located kitty-corner from here, was a parishioner in the early days. With the Reverend Catherine Dempesy-Sims at the helm, the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, like many of Buffalo's Protestant congregations, is a progressive, diverse and accepting faith community (describing the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd as ""a place of welcome to all, no exceptions"") which is active in a wide range of charitable and neighborhood-improvement organizations and initiatives."
"North Park Lutheran Church has traditionally been a congregation whose outsize sense of community — both within the congregation and as a component of the larger community — belies North Park Lutheran Church's small size. A choice of traditional and contemporary worship services are held by this church whose zeal for sharing this church whose zeal for sharing their faith and love for the community is really remarkable's faith and love for the community is really remarkable. Visitors are welcomed with open arms."
"Founded in 1912 as a mission of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church on the Near East Side, the congregation of Parkside Lutheran Church met for several years in the building later known as the '''Fairfield Branch Library''' before the construction of the stately Tudor Gothic stone church in Central Park in which the congregation of Parkside Lutheran Church is currently situated. Today, Parkside Lutheran Church's energetic young pastor, Nate Preisinger, leads a progressive and inclusive congregation that is as dedicated to reaching out to the larger community as it is to rolling out the welcome mat to regular parishioners and first-time visitors alike."
"St. Andrew's describes St. Andrew's aptly as a ""spiritual oasis"", warmly opening St. Andrew's's doors to visitors of all stripes. Founded in 1875 as an anomaly — an English-speaking Episcopalian congregation on the East Side, which in those days was largely German and Catholic — St. Andrew's's has been a University Heights landmark (and, in fact, a Nationally Registered Historic Place) since the construction half a century later of the elegant Gothic Revival building St. Andrew's currently calls home. St. Andrew's's pastor, Ellen Brauza, leads a faith community which is, in the words of the church the church itself, ""friendly, diverse and inspirational"". Two types of services are held each Sunday: a modern, simplified one bright and early, then traditional ""high church"" later in the morning."
"University Presbyterian Church was founded at an opportune time — almost simultaneous to the purchase of the old Erie County Alms House across the street by the University of Buffalo for use as the University of Buffalo's new campus. A longstanding neighborhood landmark, University Presbyterian Church is a gorgeous Colonial-style church building whose 70-foot (21m) bell tower stands sentinel over Main Street. University Presbyterian Church's identity bears many similarities to that of the college across the street, providing a caring, tolerant, diverse, and intellectually stimulating environment for worship, public service, and loving outreach to university students as well as other members of the community."
"The oldest extant building in North Buffalo — the '''Washington Russell House''' on Main Street in the Vernon Triangle — is now the meeting hall (don't say ""church""; which, according to the website, is a word reserved for the congregation the congregation itself) of The Church in Buffalo, a nondenominational, heterogeneous community of Bible-believing born-again Christians who hold one service each on Sundays in English and Mandarin Chinese. Visitors are welcome to those ""Lord's Day meetings"" as well as special weekly functions for young people (Saturdays) and UB students (Wednesdays)."
"Though multiethnic today, the Evangelical Christian Church of Buffalo was founded in 1990 by a motley group of newly landed refugees from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and other regions of the soon-to-be-former Soviet Union, led by pastor Leonid Ostrapovich. Today, Pentecostal services and Sunday school classes for children are held in English and Russian in the former '''Ahavas Achim Lubavitz Synagogue''' on Tacoma Avenue, the Evangelical Christian Church of Buffalo's home since 2002. Visitors, Slavic and otherwise, are welcomed enthusiastically."

Opened in 2006, has received rave reviews from all quarters since,offering some of the best dishes you can taste in the city's. A great place to try out Azeri cuisine with great meat dishes."
"About this price includes a full caviar spread and sushi bar in addition to the normal brunch fare (carving station, omelette station, salads, fruit, baked goods, desserts, the options are nearly endless). There is also bottomless champagne glasses (and champagne is quite good) and a huge frozen ice sculpture that is tapped where you can refill your glass with iced vodka as many times as you'd like. The jazz is very good and the pace is relaxed and enjoyable. The only caveat: As with most Russian eateries, there is no non-smoking section, so if you are not a smoker, ask for table away from the majority or risk having to inhale cigarette smoke while you dine."
"Overdone and overpriced Russian-kitsch tourist trap for foreigners (Russians wouldn't be caught dead here). But if you're staying nearby, they'll treat you fine and you can eat some bear meat."
"A great, small, cozy, and very stylish brick-walled Russian restaurant, with excellent food, and good enough service. Live entertainment comes often, and is often surprisingly good&mdash;imagine sitting down and only then seeing a solo jazz guitarist sit down to play some beautiful music.

"A comfortable, big bar with upscale drinks and cooking. The biggest draw is the cool clientele and live performances: blues, jazz, R&B. One tip though, if you open the door to a DJ blaring Russkaya popsa&mdash;leave because you won't be able to hear yourself think."
"Combination bar and laundromat. Have a beer while washing your clothes! Operated by a famous local designer that also operates the Produkty Fontanka 17 club."

"A classy wine bar."
"Old-world luxury atmosphere. Smart casual attire."
"A suitably spaced out place for a club whose name can also be interpreted as ""the mushroom eater"" or a famous Russian's poet surname, the acts here are famously offbeat, especially on weekdays when you're as likely to find a poetry reading as live reggae or a DJ spinning psychedelic trance. a club whose name can also be interpreted as ""the mushroom eater"" or a famous Russian's poet surname, the acts here is hidden in an underground bomb shelter with a new performance space/bar/restaurant atop the bunker's hill."

"A popular DJ bar/cafe for local scenesters, as well as 20-something tourists and ex-pats, located on the most central intersection (Nevsky prospekt and Fontanka).  Due to strict dress code don't try to enter with a backpack and be ready to  hear that the party tonight is ""invitation only"". It means the security did not like your look. The place was opened by St. Petersburg avant-garde musician and heartthrob Kirill Ivanov and friends in the beginning of 2011, at the end of 2011 Mishka has already achieved the title of'' St. Petersburg's Best Bar'' according to TimeOut magazine. During daytime, Mishka more of a cafe (with free WiFi), where you can relax, read and/or chat and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and fresh salads. In fact, The place's one of the few places that serves in line with the Western understanding of ""salad"" - a huge bowl of fresh greens with a choice of other fresh ingredients to add, rather than the traditional Russian understanding of salad which is usually a lot of mayonnaise with other ingredients and often without any greens at all. There are two spaces - the entrance space is the ""club"" side, generally the rowdier side and the place to get boozed up and drunkenly dance the night away, and the second space is more relaxed, more brightly lit, non-smoking, and a comfortable place to grab a bite to eat (even at 4am!) and sit and chat with your friends without shouting over the music from the entrance space.  At night there is usually a DJ playing (even on weeknights!) whatever hipsters are listening to these days (rather than typical Russian clubs that only play worn-out house and 90s pop) and The place can get very crowded on weekend nights.  Try one of the dozens of specialty shots to get your night started in the right spirit... or to end your night, if you're on a bender."
"Cavernous live music hall with old brick walls and loft outdoor bar, separate room with wrap-around bar and small DJ stand, chill-out room with small concerts and a terrace bar for dancing under the White Nights skies. Pizza is sold in the back. Very diverse music program: from reggae to punk/metal, but mostly rock. Friendly atmosphere. The crowd is made up of students, musicians, artists and expats. The space also includes MOD Gallery with local art on display. Design of the club is worth checking out as well. Menus in English, English-speaking bartenders, inexpensive beer."
"Literally, 'Groceries'. Opened in the fall of 2011 by designer Lisa Izvozchikova, owner of Stirka bar. The space is modest in size, but being one of the rare cafe-bars in St. Petersburg located above basement-level, boasts views of the Fontanka and features local DJs as well as more ""amateur"" music lovers spinning their favorite tunes, sipping cocktails and occasionally dancing and even singing along if the mood strikes them. Produkty features a carefully thought-out range of alcohol - all the makings of any classic cocktail as well as a delicious and dry cider ""St. Anton"", grog, milkshakes with berries, a homemade hot ginger tea, as well as freshly squeezed orange juice. The food is mainly vegetarian, and the offerings include couscous and sandwiches. All the furniture was brought from Berlin: the leatherette-upholstered bar, massive leather armchairs, round bar stools from the 1970s, chairs taken from GDR kindergartens and schools, typewriters and a Wurlitzer jukebox that only accepts Deutschmark (don't worry! you can buy the necessary Deutschmark tokens at the bar). The classic hipster-reference to East Germany is not completely lost when it comes to describing the style and clientele of Produkty.."

"Built in 1912, Al Ahmadiya School was Dubai's first school and has now been nicely restored. It would be a stretch to call the exhibits of old reed pens and diplomas fascinating, but the exhibits of old reed pens and diplomas've tried pretty hard, and if nothing else, the air-con and clean toilets may come in handy.

"Not a mall, but a '''historic market''' that has been a part of Dubai since the origin of Dubai Dubai. Located at the mouth of the creek, Dubai dazzles people by selling gold in large quantities and with little visible security. A must visit for shoppers and sightseers. Most of the gold is 22ct quality and quite expensive - although even here the shopkeepers are prepared to bargain - and the craftsmanship can be remarkably detailed. The gold items are sold by weight with a ""making charge"" added on top to cover the workmanship. It pays therefore, to go shopping armed with the current gold price and a knowledge of the making charges in order to hone the bargaining process. Many outlets are part of chains that also have branches in malls, so are generally reliable."
"As above, not a mall, but a '''historic market''' that has been a part of Dubai since the origin of Dubai Dubai. Located at the mouth of the creek, it is not far from the Gold Souk, but has sadly declined a bit in recent years as supermarkets take over the spice trade. If you're actually shopping for spices, odds are you'll get better prices and quality with much less hassle at Carrefour. Both the Spice Souk and the Gold Souq are a rather hot and sweaty experience with limited air-conditioning, so wear appropriately cool, loose clothing if visiting in mid summer. Individual shops are air conditioned. Although regularly visited by tourists, none of Both the Spice Souk and the Gold Souq are considered a tourist area and as such modest dress should be worn to avoid causing offence or attracting unwanted attention."

'''al-Fahidi fort''' has a few examples of the traditional reed houses and other artifacts, but isn't much to look at. The more interesting parts are the modern galleries beneath '''al-Fahidi fort''', showcasing the Emirate's history using the latest technology and culminating in a reconstructed souq from the pearling days, complete with authentic sights and sounds. It is quite fascinating to see the speed at which the transition from poor pearling village to modern metropolis occurred."

"A multifaceted public art project helmed by architect David Lagé, the idea behind Artfarms is to use unique, eye-catching installations created by members of the local art community to help establish a sense of place in the midst of some of Buffalo's most blighted environments, as well as to foster cultural awareness among the residents of marginal neighborhoods. Though Artfarms's temporary works might pop up pretty much anywhere on the East Side, Artfarms's two main installations can be found at the '''Michigan Riley Farm''' in Cold Spring and the '''Wilson Street Urban Farm''' in Broadway-Fillmore (see the ""Buy"" section for more on those). Respectively, these are the site of '''''Tree''''', a functional sculpture by Michael Beitz that consists of a picnic table designed in a curvilinear, branching form suggestive of a tree, and '''''Fall and Rise''''', a delicate-looking, roughly dome-shaped sculpture of curving metal rods and wire mesh that serves as a hothouse for the '''Michigan Riley Farm''' in Cold Spring's more delicate plants, with the walls also used as lattices for climbing vines."
"Artspace Buffalo is a homegrown artists' colony comprised of sixty loft apartments-cum-art studios that are home to some of the foremost emerging names in the Artspace Buffalo art community, as well as an expansive gallery space that displays works by Artspace Buffalo residents and other artists from Artspace Buffalo and around the region. With a full schedule of exhibitions all year long, you never know quite what's going to be on at the Artspace Buffalo Gallery: works displayed there span a wide variety of media, from traditional formats like painting, sculpture and photography to offbeat exhibitions of collage and jewel art. There are even musical performances from time to time."
"Located on the top floor of '''The Guild @ 980''' — the headquarters of and sometime retail store belonging to the local purveyor of upcycles building materials, '''ReUse Action''' — is an art gallery with a purview unique to the Buffalo area, and while the temorary exhibitions '''ReUse Action''' — put on are not what you would call ""frequent"", if you happen to be in town for one, you're in for a real treat. At '''The Guild @ 980''' — the headquarters of and sometime retail store belonging to the local purveyor of upcycles building materials, the focus is on so-called ""restoration art"": found objects from some of the same soon-to-be-demolished buildings where '''The Guild @ 980''' — the headquarters of and sometime retail store belonging to the local purveyor of upcycles building materials downstairs sources '''The Guild @ 980''' — the headquarters of and sometime retail store belonging to the local purveyor of upcycles building materials's merchandise are repurposed and reimagined in magnificent ways, displaying the timeworn beauty of the old craftsmanship."
"By most people's definition, what's housed in this repurposed Civil War-era convent on a residential street in the Fruit Belt is not an art gallery. Rather, Locust Street Art is best-known for this effort free, professionally-taught art and photography lessons for children and adults; Locust Street Art's been doing so since 1959, when local art teacher Molly Bethel began giving informal painting lessons to neighborhood children in local art teacher Molly Bethel's living room. Locust Street Art has fostered the formative talents of many successful artists over the years, and has been recognized as a winner of the New York Governor's Award in 1985, as well as by the Harvard Graduate School of Education for excellence as an educational resource for economically disadvantaged communities. The best way to see the fruits of this effort are during the art shows and fundraisers Locust Street Art holds on an occasional basis, featuring the work of current students as well as other area artists."
"The massive old factory building in Fillmore-Leroy that was once '''Trico Plant #2''', built in 1915 by the pioneering windshield wiper manufacturer and later used by Ford Motors to build airplanes during World War II, was reborn in 1991 as the Tri-Main Center. Intended as a mixed-use facility for offices and light industrial concerns, the Tri-Main Center instead became an epicenter for the nascent East Side arts community, with studios, galleries, and cultural institutions snapping up a disproportionate share of the space. The prominent presence of the arts here is celebrated with '''Trimania''', a huge biannual festival featuring live music, performances and art shows on all five floors of the Tri-Main Center, as well as '''Fourth Fridays''', a smaller monthly open house where studios and galleries display artists' works. the Tri-Main Center contains:"
"With about two dozen artists-in-residence working in a diversity of different media and representative of a broad cross-section of the local arts community, the Buffalo Arts Studio provides artists from Buffalo and beyond a venue to exhibit artists from Buffalo and beyond a venue's works — either as part of the permanent collection or through the temporary exhibitions artists from Buffalo and beyond a venue hold frequently — as well as affordable studio space in one of the area's premier up-and-coming arts facilities. As well, the Buffalo Arts Studio's mission to advance awareness and enjoyment of art among the community at large manifests the Buffalo Arts Studio's mission to advance awareness and enjoyment of art among the community at large in the form of art classes, mural paintings and other public art projects offered to local citizens."
"Moved to the Tri-Main Center in 2014 from Mundo Images's former home in Allentown, Mundo Images is run by Ann Peterson, a professional photographer, language instructor, and world traveler whose mission is to enrich the world through photography, educate young people, and raise awareness of environmental issues. In addition to the small gallery where works by Ann as well as other artists are displayed, Mundo Images also produces, and sells at local stores, greeting cards printed locally on chlorine-free FSC Certified paper, which promotes environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of forests."
"Located in Olmsted's '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the Buffalo Museum of Science is located in a lovely building built in 1929 by the prominent Buffalo architectural firm of Esenwein & Johnson. The emphasis of the Buffalo Museum of Science is on natural and physical sciences; items from the Buffalo Museum of Science's 700,000+ piece collection of specimens and artifacts, encompassing almost every conceivable aspect of the anthropology, botany, entomology, mycology, paleontology and zoology of Western New York and elsewhere, are on display in the Buffalo Museum of Science's galleries. the Buffalo Museum of Science also boasts interactive science studios and a National Geographic 3D Cinema, and operates the '''Tifft Nature Preserve''', 264 acres (105ha) of reclaimed industrial land in South Buffalo."
"Operated by James Sandoro, a former curator of exhibits at the '''Buffalo History Museum''' and a lifelong collector of historic artifacts, the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum draws 10,000 visitors per year to 10,000 visitors's museum complex in a historic neighborhood just east of downtown, despite minimal advertising. As one might expect, the exhibits at the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum run heavily towards antique cars and automotive memorabilia, especially Pierce-Arrows, the luxury sedans produced in Buffalo in the early 20th century to which the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum owes the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum's name. the Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum's ''pièce de résistance'' debuted in June 2014: Buffalo's seventh and newest Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building, a filling station constructed according to an original 1927 blueprint which Frank Lloyd Wright intended for the corner of Michigan Avenue and Cherry Street a short distance north of here."
"The Buffalo Fire Historical Society Museum is located in Lovejoy, a blue-collar neighborhood that is home to many Buffalo firefighters.

The Buffalo Fire Historical Society Museum's mission also encompasses educating the public about fire safety and prevention, as well as firefighting as a career."
"The Colored Musicians' Club is a designated Buffalo Landmark, and easily the most storied jazz club in the city — founded in 1918 as the social club of the all-black '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''', The Colored Musicians' Club almost immediately became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of Buffalo-area ragtime and jazz bands as well as the world-famous elite performers of the genre. The Colored Musicians' Club continues to function as a venue for live jazz, but The Colored Musicians' Club also contains a museum with a range of artifacts and exhibits that detail the history of The Colored Musicians' Club and of jazz music in the city."
"With a history linked closely to the railroad industry that was so prominent in Buffalo at the turn of the century, the neighborhood of Lovejoy is nicknamed ""Iron Island"" because the neighborhood of Lovejoy is surrounded by railroad tracks on all four sides. The Iron Island Museum was opened in 2000 by the '''Iron Island Preservation Society''' and is dedicated to retelling the history of Lovejoy with a particular emphasis on the railroads that have shaped Lovejoy's identity. Formerly a funeral home, The Iron Island Museum's reputation for ghost sightings has attracted the attention of paranormal researchers from around the region and further afield, as well as the television shows ""Ghost Lab"" and ""Ghost Hunters"". Accordingly, overnight ghost hunts, conducted periodically by reservation, are a popular offering of The Iron Island Museum."
"The Nash House Museum is located just east of downtown: one block from Michigan Avenue, the birthplace of Buffalo's African-American community in the mid-19th Century. The Nash House Museum was once the home of Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until his retirement in 1953's retirement in 1953 — was a personal friend of such nationally-known luminaries of black history as Booker T. Washington and Adam Clayton Powell, and was instrumental in the founding of the local chapter of the NAACP and in advocacy on behalf of Buffalo's's African-American citizenry in the years before the Civil Rights Movement. Today, Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until his retirement in 1953's house is open as a museum that contains engaging exhibits and archival records chronicling the history of Buffalo's's African-American community. Also, Nash House Museum is architecturally significant as a particularly good example of the wood-frame, partially prefabricated ""Nash House Museum doubles"" that were built here by the thousands around the turn of the century."
"The crown jewel of the East Side's parks is The crown jewel of the East Side's parks's representative in the roster of Buffalo's Olmsted network: the site of the '''Buffalo Museum of Science''', the '''Humboldt Basin''', a handsome rose garden, walking paths, playgrounds, picnic shelters, and pleasant greenery. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was the first of Buffalo's's Olmsted parks to open to the public, in 1872: called ""The Parade"" at first, Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was designed to host military drills and other large gatherings, with the brightly colored '''Parade House''' as Martin Luther King, Jr. Park's centerpiece and '''Humboldt Parkway''', the most magnificent of all the Olmsted parkways in Buffalo's, linking it to the rest of the system. But Martin Luther King, Jr. Park was far from any military installations Buffalo's had; to the consternation of Olmsted, Martin Luther King, Jr. Park instead became a gathering place for the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed the Germans in the surrounding neighborhood, who disturbed his quiet pastoral vision for it's quiet pastoral vision for Martin Luther King, Jr. Park with raucous oompah bands that played at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park and neighborhood scamps damaging the grass with their roughhousing. To the rescue came Olmsted's two sons, the successors in Olmsted's firm; Olmsted's two sons, the successors in his firm's 1896 redesign curved Fillmore Avenue to discourage through traffic and added the '''Humboldt Basin''', a lovely '''Lily Pond''', and formal gardens. Olmsted's two sons, the successors in his firm renamed the park Humboldt Park, a name that was changed yet again in 1977 to the park Humboldt Park's current one. Sadly, like most of the other elements of Buffalo's's park system, the integrity of Olmsted's original design of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park sustained considerable damage over the course of the 20th Century: Martin Luther King, Jr. Park is long-gone, part of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park's west edge was sacrificed in 1929 for the science museum, and there's a basketball court where the Lily Pond used to be. But the greatest indignity happened in 1960, when the '''Humboldt Basin''' was torn asunder to make way for the '''Kensington Expressway''' ''(see infobox at right)''. The '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy''' is hard at work righting those wrongs: the '''Humboldt Basin''' has already been renovated and reopened, the restoration of the '''Shelter House''' is ongoing, and plans are afoot to recreate the '''Humboldt Basin'''."
"The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin is a five-acre (2 ha) water feature of several functions: in the summer The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin serves as a ""splash pad"" where neighborhood kids can cool off and frolic underneath fountains of cool water that jet upwards from sprinklers embedded in the ground, in the winter The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin's an outdoor ice rink, and in the spring and fall The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin's a pleasant, peaceful reflecting pool. The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin was reconstructed and reopened in 2013 by the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy'''; originally, The centerpiece of Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, the Humboldt Basin was part of the Olmsted brothers' 1896 redesign of what was then called Humboldt Park, an immense wading pool with a sand and clay bottom (later replaced with concrete) that had been dry and abandoned since the 1980s."
"Designed by sculptor John Wilson, the Martin Luther King Tribute Plaza was unveiled in October 1983, six years after the city made good on the city's longstanding promise to neighborhood residents to rename the erstwhile Humboldt Park in honor of the civil rights leader that's depicted in this eight-foot (2.5m) bronze bust portrait. the civil rights leader that's depicted in this eight-foot (2.5m) bronze bust portrait is sculpted in a somewhat idealized way; in the words of sculptor John Wilson, the civil rights leader that's depicted in this eight-foot (2.5m) bronze bust portrait was intended to ""sum up the larger-than-life ideas"" of Martin Luther King and capture Martin Luther King's ""inner meaning"" rather than simply as a lifelike representation. Underneath the bust, on the side of the low stone wall that serves as the bust's pedestal, is a bas-relief engraving of Martin Luther King at the podium at Martin Luther King's famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech."
"Hidden in plain sight on a quiet pedestrian walkway right next to the science museum is Martin Luther King, Jr. Park's rose garden: a small, cozy, tree-shaded oasis recently restored by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy where a variety of roses and other flowering plants bloom in season."
"Dyngus Day is a traditional Polish holiday that falls on the Monday after Easter; on Dyngus Day, young boys are known to ""slap"" girls who catch young boys's eye with pussywillows or squirt pussywillows with water guns in a courtship ritual called ''śmigus''. Today, Buffalo hosts the largest organized Dyngus Day celebration in the world — including Poland, where Dyngus Day has largely been forgotten. Since the mid-2000s, Buffalo's annual Dyngus Day celebration has once again been held in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore at the grand old '''New York Central Terminal''', a majestic old Art Deco train station that is yet another of Buffalo's architectural masterpieces that is undergoing extensive restoration. After the Dyngus Day Parade through the streets of Broadway-Fillmore opens the festivities, traditional Polish food and (even more popularly) drink are served in the old dining room, with polka bands attracting revelers to the dance floor. Celebrations are also held at '''St. Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr Church''' (the so-called ""Mother Church of Polonia""), the '''Adam Mickiewicz Library''', and the many Polish-owned bars and taverns that continue to soldier on in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore."
"Presented in mid-April in odd-numbered years, Trimania is a raucous evening of ""art, music and mischief"" at the '''Tri-Main Center''' on Main Street. Not only do artists and other businesses open artists and other businesses's studios and display artists and other businesses's latest masterwork to the public, but all six floors of the '''Tri-Main Center''' on Main Street are transformed for an evening into a giant freeform performance space, where live bands, DJs, comedians, dancers, poets, and performance artists vie for your attention in a lively multimedia art party that doesn't wind down until well after midnight. Drinks flow freely, the hungry can choose from a multitude of food trucks and other vendors, and all proceeds go to benefit the '''Buffalo Arts Studio'''."
"Springing from a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the state of Texas on June 19, 1865, Juneteenth is celebrated in the black community of the U.S. today as a holiday that signifies African-American pride and cultural heritage. today, each June 19th sees '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' host the U.S.'s third-largest Juneteenth festival. Beginning with a parade that proceeds westward down Genesee Street from Moselle Street to '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', Buffalo's Juneteenth festival is a lively two-day celebration that includes demonstrations of traditional African and African-American art, music and dance, ethnic foods, crafts and wares, and activities for children."
"Held on the final two consecutive Sundays of June behind the '''Buffalo Museum of Science''' at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the Masten District Jazz Festival is as homegrown as the Masten District Jazz Festival gets: in a downhome, grassroots ambience you'll catch locally-based performers and bands whose playing features the distinct flavor of Buffalo jazz music (including James ""Pappy"" Martin, who founded the Masten District Jazz Festival in 1996 and whose Love Supreme Jazz Orchestra plays every year). As well, a sprinkling of nationally-famous jazz performers stop by occasionally, plus other types of music (for instance, on the bill of the 2014 festival was Alassane Sarr, an African dancer and fourth-generation ''griot'' originally from Senegal). There are eight performances in all: four on each festival day."
"The newest in a growing list of festivals celebrating Buffalo's long-neglected jazz history, the late-July Queen City Jazz Festival sees a slate of mainly local jazz artists take the stage for an evening at the historic '''Colored Musicians Club''' on Broadway. There are two stages — the main one indoors as well as a refreshing outdoor performance space — that host about fifteen acts combined, and the adjacent '''Colored Musicians Club Museum''' opens during the late-July Queen City Jazz Festival with reduced admission rates."
"Though the '''Pine Grill''' closed some thirty years ago, the memories of the halcyon days of that Jefferson Avenue nightspot — when jazz greats like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and Dizzy Gillespie played to packed houses — are sweet enough to have inspired the '''African-American Cultural Center''' to launch an annual jazz festival that bears its name. Much like the '''Masten District Jazz Festival''', concerts take place at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' on consecutive Sunday evenings: in this case, the first two in August, beginning at 4PM sharp. The first week features nationally-famous acts, while the second week is all about the local jazz scene that's still going strong in Buffalo — and best of all, performances often feature the same old Hammond B3 organ that was once the centerpiece of the '''Pine Grill'''.

"''Dożynki'' is a traditional harvest festival of rural Poland that goes back centuries, and since 1980, ''Dożynki'''s been celebrated in Buffalo over three days in mid-August at '''Corpus Christi Church''' on Clark Street. ''Dożynki'' is has grown into one of the largest annual festivals in Polonia; appropriately enough for ''Dożynki'''s harvest theme, Polish cuisine is the star of ''Dożynki'': chefs vie annually for the coveted prize of ""Buffalo's Best Pierogi"", and a special ""Polish pizza"" is trotted out just for the occasion. As well, there's live polka music, folk dancers, guided tours of '''Corpus Christi Church''', raffles, and the ever-popular crowning of ""Miss Dożynki"", as well as a special Harvest Mass that kicks off the final day of the festivities."

"Most of the time, ""CPG's"" is a cozy, sedate Main Street bar & grill situated about midway between '''Canisius College''' and University Heights, serving well-prepared comfort food and cocktails to the over-25 crowd. What ""CPG's""'s best known for, though, are the sizzling blues shows that happen every Friday and Saturday night, where local combos like Dive House Union, the Jony James Band, and the Heavenly Chillbillies strut local combos like Dive House Union, the Jony James Band, and the Heavenly Chillbillies's stuff at the center of the Buffalo blues universe. Other genres like soul, funk, jazz and reggae crop up from time to time too, and if there's no band onstage when you visit you can still get your fix with the Internet jukebox and the Internet jukebox's encyclopedic selection of blues numbers."
"Located on Broadway just outside downtown, this former home of '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''' (and, before that, the '''Charlie Zifle Shoe Store''') has done double-duty as a renowned jazz club since not much later than the union chapter's foundation in 1918, made necessary when '''Local 43''' voted to bar local African-American musicians from membership. With jazz music all the rage among the black community at the time, the union chapter's's second-floor performance space became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of local ragtime and jazz bands after members of local ragtime and jazz bands's workday was finished, or on Sundays, to see members of local ragtime and jazz bands rehearse in the practice space the union chapter's provided free to the union chapter's's members. Soon enough, this former home of '''American Federation of Musicians Local 533''' (and, before that, the '''Charlie Zifle Shoe Store''') was a venue in the union chapter's's own right, playing host to world-famous luminaries like Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton, and more. The tradition continues today: the Colored Musicians' Club hosts big-band concerts on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons followed by a legendary open jam session in the evening. And if you're interested in the Colored Musicians' Club's storied history, there's also an attached museum ''(q.v.)'' where you can learn all you've ever wanted to know about Buffalo's jazz scene of yesterday and today."
"The Foundry is a former industrial workshop in Masten Park that now serves as an incubator for a wide range of grassroots small businesses, as well as a venue for various community-centered events and happenings.

"Yes, ""CASH FOR GOLD"" is proclaimed loudly and proudly on the signs that adorn the front of this humble storefront, but ""CASH FOR GOLD"" is more than just another sleazy old-gold broker. On the contrary, the selection of 10-karat, 14-karat and silver jewelry here is impressive indeed. As is the rule on the East Side, the merchandise here runs heavily toward urban and hip-hop styles: big, chunky hoop earrings, pendants, and diamond rings and watches abound on the shelves here. If you don't like what you see, ""CASH FOR GOLD""'s owner will even custom-design a piece just for you. Prices are fair for what you get, but what you get is of surprisingly high quality, so come prepared to spend a little bit. If jewelry repair is what you're after, ""CASH FOR GOLD"" do jewelry repair too — again at fair prices."
"In business on Bailey Avenue since 2009, the main stock in trade at Beauty Plus is a range of wholesale beauty salon equipment and supplies, as well as a great selection of wigs, in many cases made of real human hair. However, there's a wide range of street-style jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing on the walls and shelves of Beauty Plus at the heart of the Kensington-Bailey business district. Beauty Plus is also an authorized dealer of Dickies workwear."
"Carrie's High Fashions is a small place that's not particularly easy to find: look for the small ""Hats & Shoes"" sign in the window next to '''Jackson Hewitt Tax Service''', on the east side of Bailey Avenue. Hats and shoes are indeed the cornerstones of the merchandise at Carrie's's, the selection of which comprises resale vintage items as well as vintage-inspired new pieces. There's elegant, high-fashion ladies' hats perfect for church on Sunday, and beautiful dresses in bold yet refined colors and styles."
"Since 2005, City Fashion's stylish, elegant ladieswear has been attracting folks from all over the city and beyond — folks come from as far as Toronto to browse the great selection of quality items on the racks. if you're planning a special occasion such as a graduation, prom or wedding, you're in luck. The service here is friendly and helpful, and The service here do tailoring and alterations as well."
"A huge store with a huge selection, A huge store with a huge selection's inventory goes above and beyond the streetwise urban styles you see in other Bailey Avenue clothes shops: you'll find plenty of the streetwise urban styles you see in other Bailey Avenue clothes shops, but also a healthy admixture of clothes in a more traditional, even preppy, aesthetic. The interior of A huge store with a huge selection is decorated in a brash and vibrant scheme, highlighted by a loud black-and-white checkered tile floor, and The interior of the store's where you'll find a wide range of name-brand clothes for men and women on racks, shelves, even hanging from the rafters. You'll find sweats, hoodies, jeans, t-shirts, baseball caps, flannels, bubble jackets, shoes and boots (there's a huge wall given over to Timberlands), and much more. A huge store with a huge selection is also an authorized dealer of Dickies work apparel."
"Ladies' fashions are the main attraction at this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip, and value for your money is what sets value for your money apart from the competition. this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip's is a clothing store designed for the professional, no-nonsense urban lady on the go: eschewing the loud, brash, somewhat tacky streetwise styles you'll find elsewhere, the clothes here are sophisticated, understated, and upscale while retaining just the right degree of sass. And the prices can't be beat. At this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip's plus sizes abound, there's a great selection of shoes — and if you're a Buffalo Bills fan in town during football season, you're in luck, as this is when this new boutique at the northern end of the Bailey Avenue strip clear out space on the slaes floor for a ''huge'' variety of Buffalo Bills jerseys, hoodies, jackets, men's and women's shirts, and (for the most diehard fans) vintage-style Zubaz pants."
"Lucky's may not look like much from the outside, but there's a huge selection of different stuff inside that goes above and beyond ""The Latest Fashion and Beauty"" that the sign outside touts. The front of Lucky's is given over to a decent selection of polo shirts, men's and women's T-shirts, jeans, and workwear, while in back you have bath products, body oils, wigs, hair extensions, and other such items. Finally, Lucky's even sells, unlocks and repairs cell phones — a variety of brands and plans are offered. No matter what brings you here, though, you can be assured of friendly and helpful service. Lucky's's also has a second location on Sycamore Street in Broadway-Fillmore that deals in cell phones only."
"""Don't be predictable"", exhorts the motto emblazoned on the front of this humble storefront, and true to the motto emblazoned on the front of this humble storefront, and true to its word, One of a Kind Fashions's word, One of a Kind Fashions offers up an inventory that's different from your average Bailey Avenue urban clothing boutique: the selection here is decidedly upscale, without sacrificing any of the streetwise style of the selection here's neighbors. The retail space here is split into two levels: in front there is streetwear and accessories like watches, belts, jewelry, handbags and shoes whose aesthetic tends toward the loud and outlandish; walk up a few steps in back to find a range of more conservative dresses, skirts, and tops perfect for a night on the town. Furthering the balancing act between elegance and sass is the interior, brightly lit and decorated with stylish minimalism yet with delightfully gaudy accents here and there like mirrored walls."
"There's lots of urban clothes crammed into this ample, warmly decorated strip-mall boutique, particularly menswear: t-shirts, jeans, hoodies and more. Belts, shoes, boots and other accessories come in bold, bright colors and really make a statement. The folks at this ample, warmly decorated strip-mall boutique also fix broken mobile phones, iPads and iPods."
"Established in 1929 by brothers Morris and Herman Cohen and still run by the same family, United Men's Fashions is by far the oldest operating business in the neighborhood. Over the years United Men's Fashions's expanded United Men's Fashions's footprint into all three of the adjacent houses at the corner of Midway Avenue, cementing United Men's Fashions's place at the center of the Ken-Bailey retail universe. ""The clothes those words the man"" is a maxim that's oft-repeated here, and United Men's Fashions lives those words out with United Men's Fashions's extensive selection of menswear: a high-quality array of suit jackets, dress shirts and pants, tuxedos and other formalwear, sweaters, hats, and men's accessories such as ties, cufflinks, lapel pins, and belts occupy the shelves here. Despite sporting a style that's sometimes flashy, with bright, offbeat colors to choose from, what's sold here is classy and sophisticated: these pieces would be much more at home in a high-end men's shop in New York or Los Angeles than on the East Side, as attested to by the thriving online mail-order business United Men's Fashions do to homes all over the United States. Prices are not half bad, either, and the icing on the cake is superlatively friendly, attentive and helpful customer service of the kind that makes it easy to understand how United Men's Fashions has lasted this long."
"Since 1992, owner Kim Young has operated this urban fashion boutique, stocking street gear and accessories for both men and women at the heart of the Bailey strip. The styles you'll find at this urban fashion boutique are pretty much in line with the standard set by this urban fashion boutique's neighboring competitors, but the selection is decent, and this urban fashion boutique're also an authorized seller of Dickies brand workwear."
"If you've been to An Chau's big sister on Niagara Street, you'll know what to expect from the East Side satellite location of An Chau: crowded aisles stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Compared to An Chau's West Side counterpart, An Chau is smaller but also cleaner and less chaotic and claustrophobic, with shelves crowded with all manner of sauces, oils, pickles, snacks, and packaged groceries. The far-side aisles are lined with coolers and freezers that contain frozen meats and fresh exotic produce from tamarind to mung beans to Korean pears to white beech mushrooms, and there's a small counter in the back for fresh meat cut to order. One difference at the Bailey Avenue location is there's also a small range of Caribbean foodstuffs there, including johnnycake mix. If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, An Chau has you covered — and if you just got done tucking into a bowl of ''pho'' down the street at '''Pho 99''' and have the itch to try making some at home, An Chau have frozen meatballs and even packaged instant soup mix. A word of warning, though: check the sell-by dates, as An Chau is known to occasionally keep expired or near-expired items on the shelves."
"Owned and operated by Paul Diamond since 1980, Bailey Furniture is one of the longest-standing businesses in the area. The name of the game here is used and antique furniture, along with some new furniture. There's a wide selection to browse through at Bailey Furniture. As the inventory is sourced mostly from used goods people sell to Bailey Furniture, quality (and value for your money) varies widely from item to item, and the shopping experience is akin to a giant estate sale. Still, like any estate sale, there are bargains to be had at Bailey Furniture for those who are willing to hunt for them. It might be worthwhile to call ahead if you're thinking of stopping in: the staff has a habit of adhering rather loosely to the staff's posted opening hours."
"A 20-year veteran of the local music industry, Civic Davis has been selling the latest in R&B, hip-hop, reggae, gospel, jazz, and blues albums in this small shop since 1996. Browse through the selection of CDs and cassettes in the stylishly decorated sales floor overlooked by a huge fishbowl. DVDs of blockbuster Hollywood movies are available, as well as — interestingly — a range of spa and beauty care products."
"Located just off the Jefferson Avenue exit of the '''Kensington Expressway''' at the edge of the Fruit Belt, Big Basha Central has been ""your one-stop shop"" since 1995 for clothing and gear in a wide variety of urban styles: T-shirts, hoodies and jeans from brands like Rocawear, Black Label, and Coogi, designer sneakers and Timberland boots, jackets, and ladieswear too. There's also a bodega-cum-beauty supply shop, '''Big Basha Market''', across the street."
"Besides being a wholesale distributor of brand-name and designer leather coats, jackets, winter wear, caps, and t-shirts, Park Avenue Coat Company also has several retail locations, including one just outside downtown on the Near East Side. Here, in a no-frills warehouse environment, you can find some of the absolute cheapest outerwear in town: not only do you still pay wholesale prices for anything that's on the racks, but Park Avenue Coat Company also sells ""slightly irregular"" merchandise direct from the manufacturers at an even steeper discount. If you want, say, a licensed Starter jacket of your favorite NFL, NBA, NHL, or NCAA sports team, but only have $15 to spend, this is the place for you. New merchandise arrives weekly, and prices tend to be especially good around February and March when Park Avenue Coat Company're clearing out Park Avenue Coat Company's winter gear — but sadly, Park Avenue Coat Company's massive retail floor is not very well staffed by salespeople, so you mostly have to fend for yourself to find what you're looking for."
"A lot bigger inside than what it looks like from the parking lot, this Korean-owned footwear destination at the '''Jefferson-Utica Plaza''' in Cold Spring carries a decent selection of shoes — this Korean-owned footwear destination at the '''Jefferson-Utica Plaza''' in Cold Spring're a licensed dealer of Timberland boots as well as Converse products. Oddly enough, this Korean-owned footwear destination at the '''Jefferson-Utica Plaza''' in Cold Spring also carries a modest array of urban-styled jewelry."
"Contrary to popular misconception, the Buffalo Brewing Company is ''not'' Buffalo's first nanobrewery (that title technically goes to '''Community Beer Works'''), but the Buffalo Brewing Company's pint-sized facility on the edge of the Ellicott District is certainly more in line with what most folks think of when most folks hear that term — the Buffalo Brewing Company has a production capacity of two barrels per day, a pittance next to what CBW churns out on the West Side. Owner John Domres is a consummate beer aficionado — Owner John Domres started homebrewing almost as soon as Owner John Domres could legally drink — and by the time Owner John Domres purchased this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue and set about renovating this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue for this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue's new purpose, this part of town had already staked this part of town's claim as epicenter of Buffalo's's spanking-new artisanal brewing and distilling industry, with about a half-dozen like-minded neighbors in the nearby Old First Ward and Larkinville. The core of the Buffalo Brewing Company's repertoire consists of four permanent beers, all produced 100% by hand and named for years significant to Buffalo's's history (easily the Buffalo Brewing Company's most popular offering is ""1842"", a toasty Vienna lager made with imported hops whose name commemorates the invention of the grain elevator by Buffalo's milling magnate Joseph Dart), along with a slate of seasonal brews named similarly. The hours the Buffalo Brewing Company keep are brief, but if you're in this part of town on a Friday or Saturday, the Buffalo Brewing Company'll fill your growler for the unbelievable price of $15."
"Located on 12 vacant lots in Cold Spring that were sold at a municipal foreclosure auction in 2011, Michigan Riley is a bit different than most area urban farms. Rather than being owned and operated by one person or family, Michigan Riley is run cooperatively: individual participants sign up each year for one of two levels of membership, with ""farmers"" ($150/year) entitled to a share of both the produce from the farm itself and profits from sales in exchange for a commitment of four hours of farm work per week throughout the season, and ""gardeners"" ($25/year), who are not held to any hard-and-fast commitments but can take a proportional share of the produce based on how much work they put in. For short-term visitors and those who aren't interested in volunteering, the best way to get your hands on some of Buffalo's freshest locally-grown seasonal vegetables and herbs is at the seasonally-open farm stand on Riley Street — as well as a few blocks away at '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street, on the second Saturday of each month."
"Buffalo's culinary history is a cautionary tale, littered with stories of folks who've tried and failed to reinvent the chicken wing. Kobie Lewis is different. Since 2002, Kobie Lewis has been on a quest to craft the perfect iteration of Buffalo's's signature foodstuff, and along the way Kobie Lewis's learned the important lesson of working within the limitations of Kobie Lewis's source material rather than trying to force chicken wings to fill roles chicken wings weren't designed for. The result is what Kobie Lewis calls ""specialty wings"", or ""swings"" for short — and Kobie Lewis has five '''National Wing Fest''' trophies to attest to Kobie Lewis's success. Every evening at this part-food shop, part-takeout restaurant, you can choose from over 18 original flavors, comprising the standard Buffalo's sauce with varying levels of heat, barbecue wings from classic to hickory-smoked and honey BBQ, and oddballs like taco-seasoned and lemon-pepper wings. Swings sells Swings's house-recipe wing sauce and barbecue sauce in bottles as well, in-store or via mail order."
"From ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson's start in 1985 making custom promotional chocolate bars embossed with corporate logos (hence the name), ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson has guided Choco-Logo to Choco-Logo's present-day status as perhaps the most highly-regarded chocolate manufacturer in Western New York (the accolades even extend to the pages of the ''New York Times'', who lauded Choco-Logo as the official chocolate provider for '''Bloomingdale's''' department stores). Located on Broadway just outside downtown and right next door to the historic '''Colored Musicians' Club''', Choco-Logo's small factory store has been open since 2005 to sate Buffalonians' sweet tooth with artisanal chocolates manufactured just a short walk away. Most of the time the selection here is fairly modest, comprising dark and milk chocolate truffles, chocolate-covered nuts, Choco-Logo's famous ""Nutcorn"" (caramel corn stuffed with roasted nuts and coated in chocolate), and a variety of sea-salted caramels that were sampled by President Obama during President Obama's visit to Buffalo in 2010. But the holidays is when you really want to come — ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson's seasonal selections are where ""owner and chocolatier"" Dan Johnson's creativity really comes out to shine, with unique truffle options such as Eggnog, Black & Tan, and Ice Wine. Small-group tours of Choco-Logo's small factory store are also available on request."
"During winter, Newell Nussbaumer's upscale flea market — which spends the milder months at '''Parish Commons''' in the Elmwood Village — moves indoors to '''The Foundry''' on Northampton Street. As always, Newell Nussbaumer's upscale flea market — which spends the milder months at '''Parish Commons''' in the Elmwood Village — features a dizzying variety of antique knickknacks and upscale vintage clothes sold by a growing roster of vendors."
"Operated since 1995 by the '''Greater Refuge Temple of Christ''''s Reverend Gordon Sweat and the '''Greater Refuge Temple of Christ''''s Reverend Gordon Sweat's wife Larcenia, Alive Christian Bookstore carries copies of the Bible in a variety of different translations, as well as the Bible study materials, Sunday School readers from the Union Gospel Press, and sundry other Christian literature. The purview of Alive Christian Bookstore doesn't end with books, though; Alive Christian Bookstore is also a source for church supplies including robes, clergy shirts and other specialty clothing."
"The Bible Society of Western New York has been active since 1847, a nondenominational and nonsectarian ministry that distributes to the local citizenry free copies of the Good Book written in a language that is plainspoken and accessible to the masses. That mission continues on today, but The Bible Society of Western New York also run a ""Bible Book Store"" on Main Street in Fillmore-Leroy that stocks a huge selection of different Bibles representing every edition you can think of as well as 40 foreign languages. Youth ministry guides, Bible study materials, and a small selection of other Christian and secular literature are also to be had, and The Bible Society of Western New York has also teamed up with The Bible Society of Western New York's next-door neighbor, '''Bender's Christian Store''', to offer church supplies such as Communion wafers, offering envelopes, and hundreds of different Christian homeschooling goods too. The ambience here is strictly no-frills — the better to keep The Bible Society of Western New York's charitable, not-for-profit ''raison d'être'' going — but the staff is knowledgeable with any questions you may have, and the prices are unbeatable."
"Headquartered appropriately enough in an old industrial building on the north edge of Cold Spring, Buffalo ReUse's game is ""upcycling"" authentic discarded architectural elements, plumbing fixtures, furniture, and other interior pieces from homes that are slated for demolition or undergoing renovation — thereby keeping trash out of landfills while reducing demand for new items and the raw materials necessary to produce new items. At the weekend ""sidewalk sales"" Buffalo ReUse's hold in front of an old industrial building on the north edge of Cold Spring's Dupont Street entrance, you can buy these one-of-a-kind items — stuff you won't find in a million years at '''Home Depot''' or '''Lowe's''' — at a small fraction of what you'd pay for comparable reproduction pieces. Even if you're not looking to redo your home, the folks at Buffalo ReUse's are full of ideas for repurposing these old antiques into furniture, picture frames, decorative items, and more."
"If you're a fan of modern R&B and hip-hop music or the sweet strains of classic soul and Motown, you'll want to make a stop at this institution that's been anchoring the north end of the Cold Spring business district since 1962. At this institution that's been anchoring the north end of the Cold Spring business district since 1962 you'll get friendly service with no pretense or condescension, but to describe the place as ""old-school"" would be true in some ways and not in others. For instance, it's getting more and more rare to come across this institution that's been anchoring the north end of the Cold Spring business district since 1962 anymore — but the hipster-driven resurgence of vinyl LPs has yet to find the hipster-driven resurgence of vinyl LPs's way here, with CDs and DVDs dominating the inventory and only a modest selection of record albums. You can also browse a modest variety of baseball caps, T-shirts, and other streetwear, as well as racks of urban-oriented lifestyle magazines such as ''XXL''."
"The original Bikeshop has been at the service of East Aurora bicycle enthusiasts since 2006, and it's only fitting that The original Bikeshop's first introduction to the rapidly growing community of urban cyclists in Buffalo has come via a storefront in '''The Hub''', the complex of bicycle culture-themed shops and loft apartments opened in 2014 in the old '''Sibley & Holmwood Candy Company''', of which The original Bikeshop is one of the original tenants. At The original Bikeshop you can expect the same expert service and friendly mom-and-pop atmosphere as at The original Bikeshop, but here the product lines trend sharply toward high-performance road bikes for urban use, to the almost complete exclusion of off-road and mountain bikes. Bianchi, Redline, and Scott are some of the popular brands carried here, and available exclusively at the Buffalo location is the '''Retül''' line of professional performance-enhancing bike fittings. Also on offer are a full range of parts and accessories, helmets, jerseys, shoes, and even bike-mountable GPS units. Prices are high, but so is the quality of what The original Bikeshop carries, so if you're a serious cyclist The original Bikeshop merits a look."
"This brightly-decorated storefront in Delavan-Bailey is a destination for those in search of urban-oriented sportswear, outerwear, jeans and sneakers from popular brands like Nike, Timberland, and New Era. Gear Up is a crowded and not particularly well-organized place, but there are some nice finds if you're willing to hunt them down a little bit. That's especially true of the sneaker selection: if you're looking for something that really stands out, with bright colors and unusual designs, stop by. New arrivals come in every week, and Gear Up also boasts a modest range of ladies' fashions, handbags and other accessories."
"Owned since 2006 by James Barclay and situated on Genesee Street an easy walk from '''Schiller Park''', Get Your'z is a source for trendy, statement-making designer ladies' apparel (and some menswear too). Dresses, blouses, stylish jeans, leggings and hosiery come in bold colors and daring styles, and sales and promotions happen frequently. Interestingly, Get Your'z also stocks a range of car accessories."
"Owner Lakeisha Williams proudly sells Owner Lakeisha Williams's line of new and secondhand women's ""Fashions on a Budget"" in this sparsely decorated storefront in the heart of the Delavan-Bailey business district. If your tastes tend toward the Afrocentric, KeeKee's is the place for you, with lots of colorful wooden jewelry and flowing dresses in tribal-style prints, but aside from that the styles here tend to be a bit more understated than what you'll find on a your typical East Side urban fashion boutique. But there are some really upscale finds here among the dresses, blouses, shawls, shoes, handbags, and other accessories."
"A newer addition to the roster of Bailey Avenue clothing boutiques, Legacy Apparel is a huge emporium located at the far southern end of the strip stocked with a huge range of streetwear for both men and women — hoodies, jackets, baseball caps, and some of the best-priced jeans you'll find anywhere on the East Side. Bright colors and hip-hop styles abound. And if Bailey Avenue is particularly busy on the day you visit, never fear about parking — Legacy Apparel boasts an ample off-street lot."
"The East Side satellite location of the original '''Mr. Millennium''' in Grant-Amherst, Mr. Millennium II is located in Delavan-Bailey and mostly stocks the merchandise that has made the original '''Mr. Millennium''' so successful: a mixture of prepaid mobile phones and accessories on the one hand, and on the other hand a staggering range of clothing for men and women that runs the gamut from T-shirts and hoodies to designer jeans to ladies' formalwear to jewelry and accessories galore."
"Sky's the Limit is run by local entrepreneur Ahmed Ahmed, a second-generation Yemeni-American immigrant who also owns '''Farm Fresh Market''' across the street. The main attraction here is a dizzying range of beauty supplies as well as wigs and weaves, but there's also a similarly impressive selection of urban-style women's apparel and footwear, with excellent bargains to be had on bold, sassy tops, leggings, dresses and other formalwear, work uniforms, and even kids' clothing. The downside at Sky's the Limit is the customer service, which tends toward the inattentive."
"As the name indicates, Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar is a small grocery store in Schiller Park that serves the needs of the area's teeming South Asian immigrant community with a small selection of ethnic foods. Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar you'll find a variety of spices, staple foods such as rice and dried grains, as well as more standard bodega fare such as soda pop, snack foods, and canned goods. Friendly customer service is a specialty at Indo-Pak Bangla Bazar: the credo is ""Quality comes first, profit is profit's logical sequence""."
"Steve's Meats has been serving the Delavan-Bailey community and beyond since 1978, and you don't get that kind of longevity in a business without something special in the mix — and the one factor that makes Delavan-Bailey stand out from the rest of Buffalo's purveyors of fresh meat is the topnotch customer service. Again and again, customers rave about the consistent friendliness of owner Mark Lesinski and owner Mark Lesinski's staff and how owner Mark Lesinski and his staff truly go above and beyond in assisting owner Mark Lesinski and his staff's customers, whether it be in-store helping their customers navigate the counters and freezers or making home deliveries to regular customers who can't make it out for whatever reason. As well, Steve's Meats's stocks some of the freshest meats around: stuffed pork chops, steak rollups, chuck roasts, chicken breasts, and even custom-made combo packs fly off the shelves, and in the freezers you'll find a selection of chicken fingers, pizza logs, and other snacks, Jamaican-style beef patties, and breakfast treats like waffles, French toast and hash browns. If you're visiting near the beginning of the month, you'll likely have to brave crowds, but customers nearly always leave happy."
"""More"" is no exaggeration here — the merchandise offered by Georgetta Lowe at Georgetta Lowe's brand-new Schiller Park shop can only be described as wide-ranging. her brand-new Schiller Park shop's sells everything but the kitchen sink — kids' and adult clothes; shoes, handbags and accessories; housewares and decorative knickkacks; toys, quirky gifts, and even some furniture — with service that's friendly and outgoing. It can sometimes be a challenge navigating the crowded and jumbled interior of her brand-new Schiller Park shop, but the prices are decent (and sometimes better than decent — sales and promotions are frequent, and special events take place periodically)."

"These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space boast dozens of stalls and eateries selling all manner of groceries, prepared foods, housewares, decorative baubles, and unique gifts all under one roof. Though These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space's current building was erected in 1956, These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space dates to 1888, the very beginning of the area's rise as home of the city's Polish community; These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space was not only a place for neighborhood residents to stock up on daily essentials, but also a gathering place for Buffalo Poles to meet up with Buffalo Poles's friends, see and be seen, and enjoy a comforting reminder of Buffalo Poles's homeland. Today, Polish and other Eastern European foods and gifts still predominate, but These 90,000 square feet (8,250 square meters) of retail space's offerings are slowly diversifying to better reflect the vibrant pastiche of the modern-day East Side, with soul food stands, halal groceries, and other eclectic goods on offer.

Satisfaction is 100% guaranteed."

"The Custom Hatter is an institution that's been quietly prospering among the decline of the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood for over three decades: The Custom Hatter's where owner Gary Witkowski practices the fast-disappearing craft of old-style hatmaking. the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood, owner Gary Witkowski came up in the retail industry as a salesman and buyer in the hat department of upscale downtown clothier '''Peller & Mure''' — the hat department of upscale downtown clothier '''Peller & Mure''''s where owner Gary Witkowski first came to an appreciation for fine men's hats, which owner Gary Witkowski later honed as an apprentice to master milliner Henry Goldstein of Lynn, Massachusetts before striking out on owner Gary Witkowski's own in 1980. Today, in addition to the countless neighborhood residents owner Gary Witkowski has helped to cap off (as it were) a formal ensemble in just the right way, owner Gary Witkowski can boast of having outfitted big-budget Broadway shows like ''Guys & Dolls'' and ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', of owner Gary Witkowski's hats being worn on the big screen by stars like James Garner and Leonardo DiCaprio, and of owner Gary Witkowski's store being lauded in the pages of the ''New York Times'' and ''Fortune'' magazine. Orders are called in from around the country for fedoras, porkpies, homburgs, and other hats — all crafted on antique millinery tools — but if you're in the market for one yourself, The Custom Hatter is stocked floor-to-ceiling with selections. Prices rank decisively in the high-end, but what you're paying for is quality that's second-to-none: owner Gary Witkowski's workmanship hearkens back to the old school, using real beaver, chinchilla and muskrat fur with linings and leather sweatbands carefully sewn in place, rather than glued."

"Drawing on Debra Dechert's background in the catering business as well as Debra Dechert's talents in the kitchen, Debra Dechert took up canning as a hobby in 1989. Little did Debra Dechert know that a quarter-century later canning would turn into a lucrative business for Debra Dechert: Debra Dechert's Delights ships Deb's Delights's inventory nationwide from Deb's Delights's headquarters in East Aurora, and Deb's Delights's products sit on the shelves at numerous supermarkets in the Western New York Area in addition to Deb's Delights's flagship retail outlet that opens for business each Wednesday at the Broadway Market. What products make up its inventory nationwide? No less than 70 different varieties of jellies, relishes, salsas, hot sauces, condiments, and — above all — pretty much any kind of vegetable that can be pickled; a high-quality range of stuff that ably demonstrates the truth of Debra Dechert's slogan, ""If you can't, I can""."

"Open six days a week, this longtime Broadway Market vendor is the place to come if you want fresh fruits and vegetables.

"When it comes to Broadway Market butcher shops, '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' may have size and variety on Broadway Market butcher shops's side, but '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' have the crowds. The venerable stand operated by family patriarch Petru Lupas and family patriarch Petru Lupas's son, David, is an old-school operation — ""as close as you can get to Broadway Market"", in the words of one reviewer who grew up in Polonia during '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''''s golden years — and the constant hustle and bustle of customers testifies to the quality of what customers sell. family patriarch Petru Lupas sells meats that are handcut daily, and the stars of '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' are (of course) Polish delicacies such as fresh and smoked kielbasa, ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and slab bacon. '''Broadway Seafood and Meats''' is also a place to find workmanlike cuts like oxtails, neckbones, hog jowls, chicken feet and other stuff that you can't get at fancy-shmancy places elsewhere, as well as soul-food cuts that cater to an incresingly African-American customer base.

To cut down on the already low prices, you might opt for one of the variety packs if you're buying a large quantity, or else show up late in the day, when prices are reduced to move as much inventory as possible."

"Opened in 2013 in the former home of '''Dick Haberl's Tire Center''' in Schiller Park and moved three years later to this place's's current location in the heart of the East Side's immigrant community, this place's name is something of a misnomer: the inventory at Kamuna International Groceries consists mostly of standard bodega fare like cold drinks and packaged snacks.

Kitsch abounds in the housewares selection too: there are lots of porcelain decorative figurines and kitchenware, cut glass dishes & goblets, and trinkets such as solar powered dancing animals.

"This combination Lebanese food market and lunch counter is housed in a nondescript, low-slung brick building in an industrial section of Lovejoy, so This combination Lebanese food market and lunch counter's easy to miss. Don't, though — the tasty Mediterranean specialties manufactured, sold and served at Cedars bakery have earned every single one of the many raves that Buffalo foodies have tossed Buffalo foodies's way since Buffalo opened in 1981.

"Slavic Bazaar is ''the'' place for Eastern European groceries in Buffalo, but don't be fooled by the painting on the side of the building of a pig in a frying pan: while fresh meats are indeed sold here, the selection is more modest than, say, '''European Deli''' on Clinton Street. Where Slavic Bazaar excels is in canned and packaged groceries, as well as frozen foods. Unlike '''European Deli''' on Clinton Street, the selection here goes far beyond Poland: foods from Kashuba's native Ukraine as well as Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Latvia, and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe are well-represented on the shelves. Canned vegetables, snacks, chocolate, pickled products, jarred fruit preserves, and spice mixes abound, along with an ample wall of freezers stocked with pierogi homemade in the factory behind the store, frozen ''borscht'' and other soups, savory ''pelmeni'', and more. As for that modest selection of meats, there's a deli counter where you can get ''salo'', ''kiszka'', ''kabanosy'' and other favorites, as well as a small walk-in cooler with things like smoked fish fillets and Bulgarian ''kashkaval'' cheese. And if you happen to work up an appetite shopping for your favorite Eastern European imports, Slavic Bazaar also has a lunch counter where you can sink your teeth into mouth-watering pierogi (cooked in the Ukrainian style, smaller and denser than their Polish cousins), hot, sizzling sausage, and more."
"Founded in Allentown in 2006 and moved to B West Studio's current home in 2014, B West Studio is the project of local artist Peter Caruso. In addition to local artist Peter Caruso's own work — characterized most often by energetic yet anonymous crowd scenes, rendered in acrylic paint in a style indebted to 19th-century Impressionism and often including familiar Buffalo streetscapes as a setting — B West Studio's gallery space in the heart of its current home also displays an eclectic range of works by other artists from Buffalo and around the region, with an emphasis on student works. Many of the high-quality pieces displayed in B West's gallery space in the heart of Kaisertown are available for sale, generally at $400 or less. Special exhibits are held on a monthly basis."
"With a background in garment production and an accomplished career as a seamstress behind Elisabeth von Hahn, Elisabeth von Hahn emigrated to Buffalo from Germany in 1999 and opened this cute little shop a few years later. In the words of the website, Elisabeth von Hahn's mission to ""for the younger generation to learn the crafts that are dying out in this modern era"", so instead of focusing exclusively on popular or trendy pursuits such as knitting and cross-stitching, this cute little shop carries supplies for a wide range of different crafts. If you're into spinning, weaving, quilting, lacemaking, or paper crafts such as stamping or Cricut, this cute little shop is the place for you — they even cater to jewelry and stained-glass artisans! Even if you're not in the market to buy anything, this cute little shop is a busy place: craft instructor Dawn Flammger comes by on a frequent basis to host classes in knitting, cardmaking, and scrapbooking, and this cute little shop even welcomes DIY types anytime during business hours for ""open crafting"", where you can pursue your craft in-store and even borrow this cute little shop's rubber and acrylic stamps, embossing folders and Cricut cartridges for a nominal price. this cute little shop do alterations, too, and as for the ""gifts"" half of the equation, a range of porcelain figurines, plush toys, knitted items, books, handbags and accessories are stocked."
"Tucked away in an easy-to-miss storefront near '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', the motto at The 11th Hour is ""Where Fashion Meets Style"" — and the style in question is more urban than urban. On the pastel-pink racks at The 11th Hour you'll find a compendium of edgy, eye-popping, envelope-pushing pieces, each color brighter and each pattern louder than the next: these jeans, tops, bodysuits, shoes, and accessories are for those who want to make a real statement, and decidedly ''not'' for those who don't like to wear their clothes skintight. Personal styling services are also offered."
"Since 2009, this large Bailey Avenue clothing emporium has been a destination for urban athletic wear and street-level styles that are often preppier than other fashion boutiques on the East Side. At this large Bailey Avenue clothing emporium you'll find a wide selection of shoes, as well as ''lots'' of name brands: Polo, Timberland, Champion, New Era, and Levi's are only some of them."
"From the outside, this little place in Humboldt Park looks like the perfect spot to pick up a cold pop, candy bar or salty snack — and indeed, if you're in the market for something like a cold pop, candy bar or salty snack, you won't be disappointed. But Al Madina is much more than just another corner bodega. The sign outside the door boasts of an international selection of groceries that encompasses ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Arabian, Nepali, African, Spanish, and American"" goods, but in reality, the accent here is decidedly on Middle Eastern and South Asian foods — principally halal meats and fish, spices, and a modest selection of fresh produce. Al Madina is also a source for clothing, both including both Western and traditional Muslim garb."
"Appletree Halal Market's main claim to fame is some of the best takeout halal food you'll find in Western New York: a range of Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes including chicken, goat and lamb curries, biryani, and even halal pizza are ladled out for you from steam trays for some jaw-droppingly low prices. But if you'd rather try your hand at making your own version of a range of Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes including chicken, goat and lamb curries, biryani, and even halal pizza, have no fear: Appletree Halal Market's stocks everything you need, from fresh meats to vegetables to an amazing selection of spices, plus hummus and tahini, fresh pita bread, delicious fruit juices, frozen foods, and more. You can even find traditional Muslim clothing such as ''hijabs'' and ''abayat'' here. What really sets Appletree Halal Market's apart, though, is the warm and helpful service provided by owner Mohsin: a friendly, larger-than-life character who imbues Appletree Halal Market's with a boisterous spirit that's light-years from the taciturn surliness of other halal food store personnel."
"At Bailey Avenue Café and Bake Shoppe you can get a great variety of cakes, pies, cookies, brownies, and other sweet treats, as well as prepared sandwiches and wraps and even soul-food dinners such as catfish fillets and fried chicken, served and/or sold to you in a spotlessly clean environment by folks who are as courteous as can be. But that's not the real reason you should visit: instead, stop in to show support for the work of '''Saving Grace Ministries''', who operates Bailey Avenue Café and Bake Shoppe as a job training service for '''Saving Grace Ministries''', who operates the shop as a job training service for their staff of formerly homeless individuals's staff of formerly homeless individuals."
"Camellia Meats was born in 1935, when Edmund Cichocki, a longtime butcher for '''Slawinski Meats''' at the '''Broadway Market''', struck out on Edmund Cichocki, a longtime butcher for '''Slawinski Meats''' at the '''Broadway Market''''s own, selling Edmund Cichocki, a longtime butcher for '''Slawinski Meats''' at the '''Broadway Market''''s own family-recipe Polish sausage and ham. Over eighty years later, Camellia Meats is still run by the third generation of the same family — and while you can get all the same stuff today as you could back then (the merchandise still trends toward Polish specialties such as ''kiszka'', ''kabanossy'', and the aforementioned Polish sausage which has gone on to win many awards), and Camellia Meats carries a full line of over fifty fresh-cut meats both at Camellia Meats's the '''Broadway Market''' outlet and the stand-alone shop that opened on Genesee Street in 2013. Camellia Meats boasts a 40-foot (12m) refrigerated display case and a row of freezers on the back wall, selling multitudinous cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and fish, deli meats and cheeses, and a small selection of fresh produce and prepared foods. If you're planning to make a large purchase, take advantage of Camellia Meats's discounted package specials."
"Located on Fillmore Avenue in Humboldt Park, Jawani is a halal grocery store and bakery that carries a modest selection of Middle Eastern specialty foods — with an accent on halal meats such as goat, lamb, chicken and fish — alongside an otherwise bodegalike selection of candy, snacks, cold pop, cigarettes, and the like. Fresh produce is also sold."
"A family-operated urban farm operated under the auspices of the '''Farmer Pirates''' collective, Pickles & Peppers is situated on a six-acre (2.5 ha) plot near the border of Genesee-Moselle and Broadway-Fillmore that's shared with the '''Farmer Pirates''''s '''central composting facility'''. Owners Alex and Dan grow a range of hot peppers and other vegetables that Owners Alex and Dan sell fresh, dried, pickled and prepared into a wide range of artisanal hot sauces at a seasonally-operated farm stand on Gittere Street. You can also pick up fruits from the orchard located on the same site: several dozen heirloom apple, cherry, and pear trees as well as berry bushes do double duty as a haven for area wildlife."
"At this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''', you'll find a mix of ethnic specialty groceries from the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent that prominently includes a range of hand-slaughtered halal meats of superior variety, quality, and freshness: lamb, chicken, beef, and more are available directly to customers or sold wholesale to area restaurants. If you have a specific order in mind, you can even deliver a specific order to this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' via text and this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''''ll have a specific order waiting for you when you arrive. As well, Walden Halal Groceries also sells fresh produce, an impressive variety of spices, and bodega fare such as snacks, candy, and cold drinks. this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' closes during Friday prayers, and customer service is limited by the staff's tenuous grasp of English, but this clean, well-kept store a stone's throw from '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' is still a good place to go for fans of Asian and Arabian cuisine."
"The Guild @ 980 is operated out of a 100-year-old factory building on the historic Belt Line Railroad by '''ReUse Action''', a group that splintered off of '''Buffalo ReUse''' in 2011 but shares much the same ''raison d'être'': salvaging construction materials, architectural elements, and furnishings from soon-to-be-demolished homes, refurbishing soon-to-be-demolished homes, and offering soon-to-be-demolished homes up for sale to the next generation of home builders, thereby preserving the old-fashioned craftsmanship of the original items while simultaneously conserving raw materials and preventing waste from building up in landfills. If you're in the middle of a home construction project, The Guild @ 980 offers your pick of old doors, windows, wooden beams, bathtubs, sinks, floor tile, light fixtures, and the like — and if not, you can still peruse a pretty nifty selection of antique furniture and home decor. The Guild @ 980 also boasts a small third-floor gallery space described above."
"The main attraction at this crowded, jumbled Fillmore Avenue bodega is a range of prepaid cell phones and calling plans, but this crowded, jumbled Fillmore Avenue bodega also carries a wide range of specialty fragrances, toiletries and household items for the Arabian and African community that has coalesced in Humboldt Park: here you can find incense, rose attar and other fragrant essential oils, oil burners, shea butter soaps, and the list goes on. The picture is completed by the optimistic go-getter personality of owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur: whether expounding on owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur's personal philosophy of ""do for self"" or just chitchatting with owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur's customers, owner Duane Madyun, who is highly regarded among the Humboldt Park community as the epitome of a successful entrepreneur's spirited presence is a delight to visitors to this crowded, jumbled Fillmore Avenue bodega."
"You would never imagine that such an interesting, eclectic and high-quality range of merchandise would be available in a ramshackle brownstone storefront in Delavan-Grider, but stop in to Hobby Boyz and your expectations will surely be exceeded. Browse the shelves and you'll notice that the accent here is on supplies for hobbyists: the selection of remote-control cars and airplanes, scale-model hobby kits, and supplies for collectors holds the selection of remote-control cars and airplanes, scale-model hobby kits, and supplies for collectors's own with any other outlet in Western New York. If what you're aiming for is something a bit more active, Hobby Boyz is also an authorized dealer and repairer of Razor brand scooters (both electric and nonmotorized); Hobby Boyz stock a full line of accessories and safety equipment too, as well as skateboards, dirt bikes, Minimoto bikes, ATVs, and pretty much anything else you can think of on wheels. But Hobby Boyz gets even more diverse than that: as if to really emphasize the ""variety"" in owner Richard Wagstaff's slogan, ""a new-style variety store"", you'll find a full line of car stereos and audio equipment, designer clothes, video games, DVDs, hair-care products, convenience-store snacks, and a ridiculously ample range of other goods."
"Simply put, Leslie Thomas' small, friendly Fillmore Avenue boutique is a gold mine for folks in search of high-quality vintage items: secondhand skirts, blouses, fancy dresses, shoes and even menswear are available for a song, as well as housewares and decorative items. Donations are graciously accepted, too — as Leslie Thomas' small, friendly Fillmore Avenue boutique's credo goes, ""the value in a person is in what a person gives, not what a person receives""."
"On and off since 1969 — when Harry Stokes''s had the spare time to put into running Our World Boutique, on top of working Harry Stokes''s primary job — Our World Boutique has been Harry Stokes' own labor of love. Our World Boutique's latest iteration opened in 2009, in the same building Our World Boutique was in when Our World Boutique last closed Our World Boutique's doors in 1987, but the inventory on the shelves remains the same as ever: Our World Boutique was described in a ''Buffalo Rising'' writeup as being ""dedicated to a world of ethnic delights"", but really that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Instead, the ''huge'' range of items stocked here are a magnificent reflection of the vitality of Buffalo's African-American community in all Buffalo's African-American community's facets. ""Diaspora gifts"" of all descriptions are the name of the game here: from African-inspired artwork, housewares, and decorative knickknacks, to toiletry items like black and shea butter soaps and a range of natural body oils and creams, to scarves, kaftans and other clothing. But if Our World Boutique's inventory has one singular strong point, the inventory on the shelves's literature — Bibles, Korans, and books touching on African-American themes abound; those interested in local African-American news and views can pick up copies of the ''Challenger'', ''Criterion'', or ''Final Call''; and, above all, they stock Buffalo's's largest selection of Afrocentric greeting cards, with over a dozen series represented. The vivacious personality of Our World Boutique's owner is matched by the vivacious colors on the outer walls of Our World Boutique: proud, bright reds, oranges, greens and blues, inspired in equal measures by the attractive storefronts of Elmwood Avenue and other fashionable shopping districts, as well as the vibrant hues of Africa. Our World Boutique is truly one of a kind."
"Auntie's has flaws, but they're worth overlooking. Auntie's keeps odd hours and is helmed by an owner who's known to be cranky with customers from time to time, but the food is delicious and the menu is much wider-ranging than other area Jamaican restaurants. You'll certainly find what you're looking for at Auntie's's if you're in the mood for one of the basic standards, like jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail, or escoveitch fish, but if you're feeling more adventurous, Auntie's also have harder-to-find selections like curry shrimp, ackee and saltfish, and red snapper. Best of all, Auntie's makes Auntie's's own ginger beer; if you're not in the mood for that, other drinks include sorrel, Irish moss, and healthy carrot and cucumber juices. Dessert adds a strong Southern/Creole accent to the proceedings, courtesy of options like banana bread and homemade sweet potato pudding."
"Baba's Place opened in 1989 as '''Sam's Express''' and has been serving ""ethnically influenced comfort food"" (Baba's Place's words, and perhaps the best possible description of the fare served there) under Baba's Place's current name since 2001. Baba's Place is a tiny little restaurant with only a few tables, but that just makes the selection of food available there all the more impressive: a mélange of Greek and American specialties that come in portions that are huge and prices that aren't, and are served quickly and efficiently by friendly staff. Buffalo Greek diner staples such as gyro and souvlaki are served the traditional way — with pita bread and a Greek salad on the side — or you can get Buffalo Greek diner staples such as gyro and souvlaki on sub rolls. Buffalo Greek diner staples such as gyro and souvlaki're equally good either way. Baba's Place serves a range of other pita-pocket sandwiches and ""pita tacos"" as well, plus shish kebabs and a truly delicious rice pudding; vegetarians will be pleasantly surprised by the range of meat-free options here, such as falafel and ''spanakopita'' (spinach pie layered in ''phyllo'' dough). Consensus says the American food served here isn't quite as good as the Greek, but you can get a selection of hot and cold subs and melt sandwiches, as well as Asian-influenced selections such as your choice of chicken, beef or shrimp stir-fried over rice."
"Bailey Fish and Seafood is the only seafood restaurant on the East Side — and the only one Bailey Fish and Seafood needs. There's no indoor seating here, so you'll have to take your food back to the hotel with you, often braving seemingly endless lines to do so (especially on Fridays, when Bailey Fish and Seafood's topnotch fish fry packs the house) — but it's worth it. Why? Simply put, the food here is ''really, really good'': the freshest, tastiest seafood Buffalo has to offer, with shipments of high-quality product arriving daily from all over the United States. The marquee item at Bailey Fish and Seafood is the ""Haddock Super Sandwich"", a feast that truly lives up to The marquee item at Bailey Seafood's superlative name: a gargantuan fried filet on a locally baked '''Costanzo's''' bun, topped with tangy coleslaw and homemade French fries, big enough for two people to share yet at a price of only $5. The marquee item at Bailey Seafood and other sandwiches are frequently ordered in combos (or, for larger parties, ""family packs"") where the already excellent value for your money is improved further. Dinnertime at Bailey Fish and Seafood sees mains like breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp skewers, crawfish, steamed clams, and various fish filets served ''à la carte'' or in combo packs, and Bailey Fish and Seafood even sell fresh fish and one-, two-, and five-pound packs of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters if you're planning an event. Meanwhile, the slate of appetizers and sides is where the Southern and Creole influences that pervade Bailey Fish and Seafood's menu come out best: try the hush puppies, mac & cheese, fried okra, or homemade sweet potato pie if you want a sample. Service is quick and friendly especially considering the unrelenting crowds the staff has to deal with; if you want to make it easier on the staff and yourself, you can call ahead or order online and the staff'll have your food waiting for you when you arrive."
"With a multitude of '''Taste of Buffalo''' awards under its belt and a strong claim on the title of best Jamaican food in town, the ""experience"" here is astoundingly good, if a bit strange at first. The odd way the restaurant is set up is usually the first impression for first-time visitors to the ""experience"" here: the front room is a handsome if usually empty bar with a pool table, and the counter where you order your food is in the back (ring the buzzer in front to get the owner's attention). In between is a large dining room, sparsely but pleasantly decorated with Jamaican flags adorning the dark wood panelling of the walls. The food served here earns no points for innovation — the ""experience"" here's menu sticks to the standards, but does so with aplomb. The jerk chicken is flavored perfectly, not overpowering in The jerk chicken's spiciness but with a meaty, somewhat smoky aroma and none of the sweetness that occasionally pops up at places like '''Curly's''' or the recently closed '''Mangoz''', and the culinary excellence carries over to the other selections as well: curry goat, brown stew chicken, oxtail, escoveitch fish, and a few others. Authenticity is the rule, and portion sizes are huge especially considering the prices. All meals are served with fried plantains, red beans and rice (they'll cover it with delicious, spicy jerk gravy if you want — highly recommended), and steamed cabbage; all your favorite island beverages are offered as well, from ginger beer to Irish moss to rum punch."
"Opened in 2016 in a restored building on Bailey Avenue, The Fire Spit's name is apropos — not only is The Fire Spit's's owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter, but its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter valiantly persevered with its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter's dream of operating a family-owned restaurant even after an electrical fire ripped through a restored building on Bailey Avenue just before the planned opening of The Fire Spit's, setting its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter back two full years. But, what does The Fire Spit's serve? Char-grilled hot dogs? Blazing-hot Mexican or Asian food? its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter doesn't take the metaphor quite that far, but if you're in the mood for some delicious, homestyle soul food classics made fresh to order and served by one of the friendliest staffs of any restaurant in the city, The Fire Spit's is a place you should check out. Though The Fire Spit's does stay open through dinnertime, breakfast (all-day!) and lunch are the two busiest times of the day here: the biggest seller on the menu by far are the chicken and waffles, uniquely served with whole, unsplit wings fried up to crispy perfection (you can substitute tenders or traditional wings on request). At lunchtime, you can also try a delicious steak hoagie slathered in its owner, Rodney Wilkinson, a retired Buffalo firefighter's own secret-recipe ""Tailgate Comeback Sauce""; if you've come with a bigger appetite, tuck into one of the combo platters on the dinner menu where fried chicken, haddock or shrimp come with your choice of Southern-style sides. The Fire Spit's is a small place with only a few tables in the dining room, so come prepared for crowds or else you might consider getting your food to go."
"First off: if you're coming here with Ethiopian food in mind, you're going to be disappointed. Though some sources state otherwise, it seems that Mike's brief experiment with shoehorning Ethiopian specialties into Mike's's menu is permanently finished. However, if you're looking to nurse a hangover after a night of bar-hopping in nearby University Heights, the menu here is frequently described as a tastier and cheaper version of '''Jim's Steakout'''. As you might have inferred from the full name of the place, steak is the marquee ingredient: Mike's's claim to have invented the steak taco is dubious at best, but that doesn't make the steak taco any less delicious, and the ""Steak in the Hood"" hoagie comes with pork sausage in addition to the titular filling. Aside from steak, Mike's's serves a full range of hot and cold subs, burgers, sausage sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, and tacos. Mike's deliver, too."
"Founded in 1999 (hence the name) and located since 2003 on Bailey Avenue within walking distance of the '''South Campus''' of the '''University at Buffalo''', Pho 99 is the '''University at Buffalo''''s first Vietnamese restaurant — and though Pho 99 no longer can claim the title of the ''best'' place in the '''University at Buffalo''' for this cuisine, Pho 99 still does a brisk business especially with university students and faculty. Noodle bowls, fried rice plates, and meat-based entrees are all available, but Pho 99's specialty is ''pho'', a Vietnamese soup made with rice noodles and flavored with bean sprouts, green chili peppers, basil and mint leaves, and lime juice. Raw beef is added to ''pho'', a Vietnamese soup made with rice noodles and flavored with bean sprouts, green chili peppers, basil and mint leaves, and lime juice; the piping hot broth cooks Raw beef before ''pho'', a Vietnamese soup made with rice noodles and flavored with bean sprouts, green chili peppers, basil and mint leaves, and lime juice is served. Consensus says the formerly impeccable quality of Pho 99's food took a hit after Pho 99 came under new management, but the fare here is still passable, and the service is friendly, if often slow."
"Kensington Avenue Pizzeria is a conundrum: locals' opinions on Kensington Avenue Pizzeria are among the most wildly mixed of any restaurant in Buffalo. locals''re equally likely to praise the deliciousness of the steak tacos and fettuccine Alfredo as to denounce the slow and inconsistent service, ""rough around the edges"" waitstaff, and high-ish prices. Kensington Avenue Pizzeria does earn points for Kensington Avenue Pizzeria's expansive menu, though — the sign outside the door reads ""the largest variety of pizzeria foods around"", which is too modest; Kensington Avenue Pizzeria's oeuvre spreads far beyond the realm of what you would usually find in a neighborhood pizza joint. Joining the usual stuff on the menu is a full range of hot and cold sandwiches, subs and burgers, Italian specialties like sausage cacciatore, shrimp scampi and various pasta dishes, Southern-style fried chicken, a selection of Greek souvlaki platters, steaks and porkchops, even Puerto Rican fare like ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil''. If you do feel like going the traditional route, though, the ""Kitchen Sink Pizza"" — with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham, onions, mushrooms, green and black olives, and sweet and hot peppers — is a winner if you're especially hungry. Breakfast is served daily till 2PM, and Kensington Avenue Pizzeria opens up on Sundays during football season to accommodate Bills fans."
"Every Friday evening at the '''Dnipro Center''' — an ethnic club and gathering place for Buffalo's Ukrainian community for over eighty years — the spacious ''rathskeller'' is converted to a restaurant serving a mix of Ukrainian and American specialties. While a mix of Ukrainian and American specialties're decently executed, the American foods on the menu are mostly simple, uninspired fare that you could find in any roadside diner — hot and cold sandwiches, main-course salads, chicken fingers and wings, heartier dinners centered more often than not on deep-fried seafood — but you're at the '''Dnipro Center''' — an ethnic club and gathering place for Buffalo's Ukrainian community for over eighty years, so it'd be a crime anyway not to go ethnic. Start off with an appetizer of ''borscht'', then choose from a slate of options that includes ''holubtsi'' (cabbage rolls), ''varenyky'' (Ukrainian-style pierogi), and more — or, if you're really hungry, opt for the ""UKE Combo"" which combines both of the above plus savory ''kovbasa'' sausage, tangy sauerkraut, and dark rye bread."
"At any time of day, you can come to this little place in Fillmore-Leroy — the old location of '''Taste of Soul''', which moved to Bailey Avenue in 2013 — for a full range of ""quick and delicious"" fast food, including burgers, chicken wings and fingers, pizza, tacos, hot and cold subs, and even Jamaican patties. But this little place in Fillmore-Leroy — the old location of '''Taste of Soul''', which moved to Bailey Avenue in 2013 — also serves breakfast, and Saturday and Sunday evenings sees a heartier range of full-size soul-food dinners served up. The pleasant, well-lit dining room tops off the coziness of the this little place in Fillmore-Leroy — the old location of '''Taste of Soul''', which moved to Bailey Avenue in 2013 — experience, decorated in warm hues of orange and brown."
"Located in the former home of '''Garris BBQ''' on William Street just outside of downtown, Taste of the Caribbean immediately took Taste of the Caribbean's place alongside '''Doctor Bird's Rasta-Rant''' and '''Caribbean Experience''' in the pantheon of Buffalo's best Jamaican restaurants when Taste of the Caribbean opened in 2015. The menu doesn't stray too far from the standards — jerk chicken, escoveitch fish, oxtail, brown stew chicken, and various ""combo specials"" thereof, each of which come with peas and rice as well as your choice of two additional sides — and prices are a bit higher than the competition, but you get what you pay for. Everything is bursting with flavor: jerk chicken is juicy, savory, and perfectly spiced (neither bland nor overpoweringly fiery); the peas and rice have an ineffably nutty aroma that is utterly tantalizing; even the steamed cabbage is delicious. Most of Taste of the Caribbean's business seems to be take-out, but there are about a dozen tables for seating in Taste of the Caribbean's dining room, which is brightly decorated with walls painted azure blue and colorful patterned tablecloths. Best of all, the grandmotherly Jamaican lady who works the counter is supremely friendly (the grandmotherly Jamaican lady who works the counter'll chat your ear off if you let the grandmotherly Jamaican lady who works the counter) and service is quick and efficient."
"Open six days a week for breakfast and lunch, the somewhat misleadingly named Tony's Ranch House is a neighborhood institution where the Pitliangas family has served a full range of Greek and American diner fare since 1981 to a loyal clientele comprised of a mixture of neighborhood regulars, '''Sisters' Hospital''' employees, and '''Canisius College''' students. The menu sticks to the basic burgers and melt sandwiches, but throws in a few Greek specialties for good measure: chicken and beef souvlaki, gyro, ''spanakopita'', ''baklava'' for dessert. Texas hots are on the menu too, the sauce sourced from a recipe that's been in the Pitliangas family since the 1950s. There's also a copious slate of breakfast options that includes homemade doughnuts and about a half-dozen specialty omelettes. The interior has been renovated and updated yet retains that classic homey ambience, but the quality of the food and service are merely average (and seem to be declining after the death of the longtime owner, George, a few years ago)."
"Serving up delicious Caribbean fare in a small, modest Jefferson Avenue storefront, Trini's clientele draws equally from neighborhood locals and '''Canisius College''''s student body. The menu is on the small side and, for those familiar with island cuisine, doesn't contain any surprises: curry chicken, jerk chicken wings, and oxtail are the best-loved options, but you can also get brown stew chicken, a variety of different ''roti'', and Jamaican patties with beef or chicken. Everything comes with heaping portions of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice on the side, and uniquely among area Caribbean restaurants, you can have the staff adjust the level of spiciness to your personal taste. Trini's's ambience is strictly no-frills — food is served in Styrofoam trays and eaten with plastic silverware — but the staff is as friendly as can be, and the sweet strains of classic soca and calypso music complete the picture. the staff cater, too."
"Located on the inner edge of the Fruit Belt right next to the Medical Corridor, the unmissable Twisted Pickle (look for the neon-green plaster cow sculpture along Michigan Avenue; the effect is like nothing so much as a '''Chick-Fil-A''' advertisement) mostly does takeout and delivery for hospital employees and guests, though there are a few small, not-particularly-comfortable indoor tables. Jammed into an unassuming little building that used to be a doctor's office, an unassuming little building that used to be a doctor's office is so named for the selection of ""specialty pickles"" they serve as appetizers: classic dill, garlic, hot and spicy, and Southern-style deep-fried pickles, all homemade. Other than that, though, the Twisted Pickle's oeuvre is pretty much your standard takeout fare — subs, burgers, wraps, main-course salads, tacos and fajitas, and pizza (whole or by the slice). Try the bacon dog, which is just what it sounds like: a hot dog bun filled with a locally-manufactured '''Sahlen's''' frankfurter and several slices of bacon. The food is passable but no great shakes, but the quick, friendly service and good prices make up for that. And, while you're waiting for your order to come up, you can play at one of the last remaining original '''Pac-Man''' arcade consoles in the Buffalo area."
"In May 2016, the long wait was finally over for the new occupant of the former Midtown home of '''Buffalo Steak & Seafood''' to be unveiled — and at the helm of the new operation was local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans's in-laws in New Orleans. Here at The Big Easy, with the help of local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans's fiancée-cum-head chef Lisa, local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans pays tribute to local attorney Sam Davis, who first fell in love with Cajun and Creole cuisine while on a visit to his in-laws in New Orleans's newfound culinary obsession, and does so with aplomb: The Big Easy may not be able to compare with '''Shango''' or '''Toutant''' when it comes to upscale ambience, but in terms of authenticity The Big Easy blows both of '''Shango''' or '''Toutant''' out of the water. The Big Easy's menu offers a degree of variety without being overwhelming in length, and the ""deep-fried Southern mainstays"" (to borrow the words of one reviewer) you can order at the counter are dominated by a selection of po' boy sandwiches, which come in 6-inch or foot-long sizes and are filled with generous portions of meat and fixin's: shrimp, fried catfish, and Cajun chicken are the most popular selections, though you can also get a roast beef or hot smoked sausage sandwich. Seasoned fries come on the side in all cases. Elsewhere on the menu is easily Buffalo's most authentic take on the muffuletta sandwich; a distinctly Louisianian take on that Buffalo's specialty, the fish fry (Southern-fried catfish takes the place of breaded haddock); and out-of-this-world bread pudding for dessert — but The Big Easy's customers reserve The Big Easy's customers's highest praise for the seafood mac & cheese that's available as a side order (though the portions are so gargantuan the seafood mac & cheese that's available as a side order (though the portions are so gargantuan it'd probably serve just as well as a main course'd probably serve just as well as a main course); a perfectly cooked, creamy and saucy ambrosia with almost as much shrimp and crawfish as pasta. The Big Easy mostly does takeout business, but there's also a small, immaculately clean dining room with a few spartan yet comfy tables and chairs. Service here is enthusiastically helpful and friendly — The Big Easy's customers really go above and beyond in showing customers customers appreciate customers's patronage."
"Since 1923, Chef's has been serving hearty Italian cuisine that is comparatively adventurous for neighborhood family-style establishments of its kind. Entrees range from familiar fare such as veal and chicken parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, lasagna, and spaghetti to more elegant selections such as dandelion salad. Reasonable prices and generous portions. Buffalonians love Chef's."
"Buffalo is a place that's well-known for having great Italian food, but DiTondo's never seems to get DiTondo's's due as part of the cream of the crop. Maybe it's DiTondo's's odd hours; maybe it's because of '''Chef's''', DiTondo's's better-known neighbor on Seneca Street, drawing folks in a block before folks get here. Whatever it is, lots of locals are missing out, so don't make the same mistake lots of locals do. There's a tiny little regular menu with maybe a half-dozen options on a tiny little regular menu with maybe a half-dozen options on it, mostly homestyle, unpretentious red-sauce fare — everyone loves the chicken and spaghetti parm, covered with the thickest shell of melted mozzarella you've ever seen — but the daily specials are the real heart and soul of DiTondo's's, which might consist of anything from hot sandwiches, to yummy main-course salads, to pasta in a marinara sauce that lacks the overt sweetness you'll find elsewhere in Buffalo. Whatever you order, expect hefty portions for blue-collar prices — and save room for the homemade custard pies, if the homemade custard pies have any left (the homemade custard pies're popular!) Best of all, DiTondo's's friendly, no-nonsense, super-efficient service is a godsend for first-time visitors who aren't sure what to order. It bears emphasizing that first-time visitors who aren't sure what to order don't accept credit cards, and Friday is the only day first-time visitors who aren't sure what to order open for dinner — otherwise it's lunch only, but then again, Friday's probably when you want to come anyway (popular with Buffalo politicos and other heavy-hitters, lunch at DiTondo's's is prime time for local celebrity-spotting!)"
"""Tastes Like Something"" is the (rather odd) motto here, and that ""something"" invariably consists of soul food classics cooked up to downhome perfection — ""as if I were having Sunday evening dinner at Big Momma's House"", in the words of one happy customer. Je Ne Sais Quoi opened in spring 2016 at the former Jefferson Avenue home of '''Mr. Bones' BBQ''' and instantly earned a devoted fanbase. You walk in from the ample parking lot and order from off the blackboard menu hanging on the wall: there's a small core list of permanent options (fried fish, chicken, and shrimp, barbecue ribs, and various combinations thereof) complemented by a revolving door of Southern-fried daily specials. Sides, of which two come with your meal, change daily as well. At Je Ne Sais Quoi the service is friendly as can be and the portions are generous, but prices are a bit higher than similar East Side soul food joints, and Je Ne Sais Quoi do not accept credit cards."
"Located in the heart of Midtown, The Oakk Room boasts an environment that's sophisticated yet relaxed, and serves an upscale and Jamaican-influenced take on classic soul food — or, as one reviewer put it, ""comfort food jazzed with exotic spices"". The menu places a definite emphasis on seafood — there's crab cakes, fish and grits, and a beer-battered fish fry on Fridays — and the Caribbean influences come out to shine in options such as jerk chicken and curry fish. The Oakk Room's cocktail list also boasts around two dozen specialty martinis to choose from. Though the range of selections on the menu is small, the food is well-executed for the most part; service is attentive and friendly, and prices are good for what you get. The ambience can best be described as that of a classic old pub, ""lived-in"" yet well-kept and refined, and the clientèle is diverse."
"The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking is an odd but delicious hodgepodge: simple hot-off-the-grill fare like burgers, hot sub sandwiches, hot dogs and French fries rub elbows on The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking with succulent Southern specialties like barbecue ribs and mac & cheese, and The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking even serve Jamaican-style curry chicken. The menu at Bailey's Homestyle Cooking is dished out to you in a homey, unpretentious environment for budget-friendly prices."
"Take the respective halves of this place's name to mean ""Eastern Europe"" and ""Western New York"", and you'll have a pretty accurate idea of the menu here. At East-West Café, you're just as apt to nosh on Polish specialties like ''gołąbki'' (cabbage rolls), tangy ''czernina'' (duck blood soup), and huge, mouth-watering Polish sausage dogs that dwarf the buns they're served on (condiments are around the corner from the cash register) as you are to enjoy local favorites like beef on weck, fried bologna sandwiches or fish fry. Simple sandwich-shop fare like burgers, fries, subs, and melt sandwiches round out the menu, along with breakfast fare in the morning and sides such as chili mac and collard greens that add a soul food element to the mix. Service is quick and friendly."
"Since January 2015, Mahmuda Chowdhury and Sitara Arshad have been serving up ""Halal Income Halal Food"" (no exaggeration, prices are ''very'' good!) at this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market. South Asian specialties are the rule of thumb at this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market — an ample selection of ''biryani'', Pakistani-style kebabs and ''kofta'', and tandoori chicken is featured — but you can also get familiar American fare like burgers, chicken and beef hoagies, pizza (plain cheese only), and even fish fry. All the food served at this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market is ''jabeha'' halal, and on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market's separate entrance leading directly to Broadway enables this humble restaurant located in the Broadway Market to stay open much later into the evening than the market the Broadway Market."
"Though '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''' served what was considered by many a Buffalo gourmand to be the best soul food in town, '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''' closed down in 2016, a victim of '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''''s own off-the-beaten-path location in a humble stall deep in the bowels of the '''Broadway Market'''. Flash forward a few months and '''McKenzie's Soul Food Shack''''s successor, Margie's, presents for the aficionado of downhome Southern cooking a scenario that's much the same as before — and, let's hope, a fate much different. its successor, Margie's, is the eponymous owner/chef who brings to bear decades of familiarity with the savory ways of the cuisine of the American South that dates back to its successor, Margie's,'s childhood days, which its successor, Margie's, spent cooking for a crowded house of 21 brothers and sisters in its successor, Margie's,'s hometown of Selma, Alabama. Now, six days a week at the '''Broadway Market''', its successor, Margie's, cooks up the most authentic takes on fried chicken (a breast and wing cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside), mac & cheese (as sinfully greasy and gooey as anything you'll find in the Deep South), barbecue ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender with a delightful tinge of raspberry in the glaze), and peach cobbler that you can find anywhere in the Niagara Frontier. Yes, just like before, but along with the aforementioned holdovers from its successor, Margie's,'s menu are more esoteric regional specialties like pigs' trotters and oxtail that are worth a try if you're in a more adventurous mood. If you've ever been down South to a ""meat and three"" joint, the setup will be instantly familiar to you, but at its successor, Margie's,'s the setup's ""meat and two"" — that is, you choose from a meat-based main course and two side dishes, plus cornbread and a biscuit, served to you cafeteria-style in styrofoam takeout containers for a flat price of $8. It doesn't get better than this."
"As the signs indicate, Potts Deli serves a combination of Polish and American fare. If you've been to the main location on Rossler Avenue in Cheektowaga, you'll notice that the menu at the Broadway Market satellite is abbreviated and tilts more heavily toward standard American comfort food — but you'll also be pleased to know that the award-winning quality of the huge pierogies remains unscathed (don't be put off by the price; you get what you pay for in terms of both size and quality). If you're in the mood to eat Polish, you can also opt for ''gołąbki'', smoked ''kielbasa'' (no fresh, sadly), or a ""Polish platter"" that combines all three with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes on the side. As for Potts Deli's American selections, you've got a workmanlike slate of standard diner options punctuated by local favorites like fried bologna and '''Wardynski's''' hot dogs. Whatever you order, it's served up with businesslike efficiency in a friendly, folksy environment pleasantly secluded from the rest of the market."
"Going strong for over 80 years, R&L Lounge is an honest-to-goodness throwback to old Polonia, courtesy of inimitable owners Ronnie and Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969. Perhaps the best description of dinner at R&L Lounge was given by the reviewer who compared dinner at R&L to ""sitting around the kitchen table with relatives"", and Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969 is nothing if not fully engaged with Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969's customers — the philosophy Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969 expounded on in a May 2010 writeup in the ''Buffalo News'' (""A bartender is like a psychiatrist... a lot of bars don't make it because a lot of bars're not trained to be people's people; a lot of bars're only trained to pour drinks"") means that Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969's liable to come over to your table and talk your ear off, dishing on the latest neighborhood gossip or showing off old family photos. The ambience — original tin ceiling, homey wood-paneled walls where old Genesee Beer ads share space with tacked-up pictures of the Virgin Mary — completes the old-school picture. As for the food, R&L Lounge's menu is limited in size but impeccable in quality: Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969's take on ''gołąbki'' is light as air and delicious, and Lottie Pikuzinski, who took over for the previous proprietors in 1969's handmade pierogi are elegant in her handmade pierogi's simplicity, standing up well on her handmade pierogi's own merits without any of the traditional accompaniments like sautéed onions and sour cream. Most popular of all, though, are the Friday fish fries — R&L Lounge's standing room only during Lent as folks from all over Western New York stream back into the old neighborhood to feast on these delicately tasty haddock filets, and R&L Lounge stays open well into the evening to accommodate folks from all over Western New York. Keep in mind that the place is a small, family-run operation, so the place sometimes closes without notice and can run out of food on a particularly busy day. It's always best to call ahead."
"Lucky's Texas Hots is a neighborhood institution in Kaisertown, serving up ""slime dogs"" and other fresh-off-the-grill goodies seemingly forever at ""slime dogs"" and other fresh-off-the-grill goodies's humble Clinton Street storefront. The local specialty that makes up 75% of Lucky's Texas Hots's name is Lucky's's main claim to fame, but The local specialty that makes up 75% of the restaurant's name's variation of Lucky's Texas Hots doesn't quite stack up: local consensus says the sauce has a bland, somewhat off-putting flavor. You're better off sticking to the other offerings, which consist of summery fare like grilled chicken sandwiches, sausage dogs, burgers, and Philly-style cheesesteak sandwiches. An upside is that service is friendly and efficient, and breakfast is served all day."
"They stay ""stick to what you know"", and Neapolis Family Restaurant follows that credo to a tee: leaving the cutting-edge haute cuisine to the other guys, the name of the game here is familiar homestyle diner fare, served with a smile in a spacious dining room that's humble but clean and well-kept — ""the prototypical family restaurant"", in the words of one reviewer. To describe Neapolis Family Restaurant as a Buffalo-style Greek diner would be technically true but a bit misleading; the souvlaki, Greek salad, and so forth that's on the menu actually pales in comparison to Neapolis Family Restaurant's classic all-American offerings, such as a range of burgers and melt sandwiches, corned-beef hash, and mind-blowing milkshakes made the old-fashioned way. Breakfast starts early and continues all day, with a workmanlike slate of pancakes, omelettes, and egg-meat-and-toast permutations augmented by delicious homemade pastry. Hearty dinner platters are added to the menu on Friday nights, when they stay open past lunchtime until 8PM. Service at Neapolis Family Restaurant can sometimes be slow, but Service at this family-owned stalwart's always extremely friendly, with a genuine personal touch — come in a few times and they'll remember your name for years — and the food is ''cheap''. A real hidden gem, Neapolis Family Restaurant is."
"The satellite location of '''Doctor Bird's Caribbean Rasta-Rant''' presents a somewhat different scenario than at '''Doctor Bird's Caribbean Rasta-Rant''''s big sister in University Heights. For one, the selection is quite a bit more narrow — there's a wide range of Jamaican patties on offer, including several choices for vegetarians, but the rest of the menu is made up of two different types of ''rotis'' as well as a few dinner platters; curry chicken or beef, oxtail, and haddock come with sides of steamed cabbage and red beans and rice. On the other hand, the Caribbean Corner also boasts a selection of packaged ingredients for those who'd like to try their own hand at island cookery, including jerk spice and an impressive array of other spice blends. There's also snacks, pop, cigarettes, and other bodega items."
"Six days of the week, the Happy Swallow enjoys a placid existence as an neighborhood gin mill that is (in the words of '''Forgotten Buffalo Tours''') ""a rare survivor of the 'family-owned tavern' era"" on the East Side, with longtime owner Tommy Golinowski pouring tall cold ones for a dwindling population of regulars in a homey, wood-paneled interior that's as old-school as a homey, wood-paneled interior that's as old-school as it gets gets. But on Friday evenings only, the kitchen opens up and visitors flock in to enjoy hearty, homestyle Polish dinners at prices that take you back almost as many years as the Happy Swallow — this is an experience that was once common in Buffalo but is getting harder and harder to find, so don't miss the Happy Swallow if you can help it. At dinnertime, fish fry is the main attraction, especially during Lent; fish fry comes in either yellow pike or traditional haddock, breaded or battered, and fish fry's ''really good''. Also on the menu is fried shrimp and scallops, plus a grand seafood platter that includes both of those plus a half-serving of fish. Pierogies (with cheese, sauerkraut or potato), roast beef, and other specialties are served too, and all dinners come with heaping sides of fries, coleslaw, American or German potato salad, macaroni salad, and bread and butter."
"Ike's is just a tiny little takeout joint on a desolate stretch of Genesee Street that's only open three days a week, but the Southern-style barbecue fare Ike's dish out is so good that it'd be unthinkable to leave Ike's out of this article. In case you couldn't figure it out from the name of Ike's, at Ike's's the name of Ike's is ribs — meaty, mouthwatering half- and full racks of pork ribs come slathered with a super-spicy hot barbecue sauce that ""will burn your soul"", in the words of one especially feisty reviewer. There's also dinner specials of fried or barbecued chicken, barbecue fish, steak hoagies, and more. And don't forget the mac and cheese, coleslaw, and other stick-to-your-ribs (no pun intended!) sides."
"Since 1969, Lee's has been dishing out what many people call the ""best barbecue in Buffalo"" out of a old converted clapboard house in the heart of Humboldt Park. As usual with this type of cuisine, the key is the sauce, and rather than the sticky-sweet, tomato-based Kansas City- and Memphis-style sauces typical to barbecue joints around here, Lee's's stands alone in Buffalo with an East Carolina-style sauce: a thin sauce with a vinegar base, spicy and sharp in flavor with no tomato at all. You can get extra sauce with your meal for $1, and be assured: you ''will'' want some. The menu is simple and straightforward, with top billing given to pork ribs and shoulder available either as a sandwich or a dinner platter with coleslaw, potato salad, or French fries on the side. Portions are huge, and though the quality of the meat is somewhat inconsistent, most of the time the meat's topnotch: meaty, fall-off-the-bone tender, and — most importantly — always saucy. Lee's's also serves barbecued half-chicken, chicken fingers and wings, and haddock dinners that are especially popular on Fridays."
"The specialty that put Ms. Goodies on the map is something Ms. Goodies call the ""junkyard dog"", which is a hard concept to wrap your head around at first — sort of a cross between a hot dog, a taco, and a fish fry, this odd concoction consists of a fried haddock filet, French fries, and coleslaw slathered with hot sauce and stuffed into a flour tortilla. But this odd concoction's delicious enough to have won multiple awards at the '''Taste of Buffalo'''. But this odd concoction is only the beginning of the story at Ms. Goodies. Breakfast and lunch is the time to come to this Bailey Avenue dive; respectively, you can indulge in delicious Southern-style chicken and waffles or a create-your-own-breakfast option with eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, grits and more as building blocks, or avail yourself of hot-off-the-grill hot dogs, burgers and fries. As well, if you're after a soul-food take on Buffalo fish fry, Ms. Goodies stays open for dinner on Friday nights with a menu that also includes fried chicken, mac & cheese, sweet potato pie, and other downhome treats."
"The two big selling points that owners Mattie and Butch Holt use to tout owners Mattie and Butch Holt's Fillmore Avenue hole-in-the-wall are ""the best breakfast in Buffalo"" and ""great soul food you'll have to taste to believe"", and true to owners Mattie and Butch Holt's word, ""the best breakfast in Buffalo"" and ""great soul food you'll have to taste to believe"" are the two things owners Mattie and Butch Holt's does best. In the morning you can get eggs served with your choice of breakfast meat plus grits and home fries on the side, as well as breakfast sandwiches, pancakes and waffles, corned beef hash, and more — all whipped up skillfully and with aplomb. At lunchtime the focus shifts to hearty Southern-fried specialties like mac & cheese, fried catfish, collard greens, and some of the most delectable fried chicken you've ever tasted: the perfect combination of crispy exterior and moist, tender interior. The downside of owners Mattie and Butch Holt's is the other foods on owners Mattie and Butch Holt's menu — standard lunchtime fare like burgers, subs and hot dogs are just okay — as well as the prices, which are way higher than the competition. Also, while the neighborhood old-timers that congregate here are as friendly as can be, the same can't be said of the service. Folks have been known to get overcharged here, too, so beware."
"In the midst of the ""food desert"" of the East Side, where the nearest full-service supermarket is often miles away and the poor often subsist on what they can get from the local corner bodega, fresh fruits and vegetables are, understandably, often hard to come by. From a health-care perspective, that's bad news — and that's why, in 2010, the '''Erie County Medical Center''' launched this neighborhood farmer's market aimed at helping the residents of one of Buffalo's most economically deprived neighborhoods to improve the residents of one of Buffalo's most economically deprived neighborhoods's dietary habits. Much more than just a half-dozen or so vendors of fresh produce, prepared foods, and artisanal goods, the ECMC Farmers' Market is also a place for fun and educational events with an overarching theme of promoting a healthy lifestyle — there's everything from ''tai chi'' demonstrations, to dance and cooking classes, to seed and plant giveaways for those who want to try their hand at gardening. Food trucks are on hand for those who work up an appetite browsing through the greenery."

"The Erie County Medical Center has a history that stretches back to 1902, when the city government founded The Erie County Medical Center under the name '''Buffalo Municipal Hospital''' to treat victims of a smallpox epidemic. The Erie County Medical Center moved from East Ferry Street to The Erie County Medical Center's current location ten years later, kicking off a vigorous campaign of expansion under the leadership of Dr. Edward Meyer, and took on The Erie County Medical Center's present name after The Erie County Medical Center's operations were taken over by Erie County in the 1970s. Today, The Erie County Medical Center is the largest single hospital in Buffalo, with 602 inpatient beds, and is an important teaching facility for '''UB Medical School''', with many faculty members doubling as doctors and other caregivers. The Erie County Medical Center is Western New York's designated treatment center for trauma care and HIV/AIDS treatment, and is also renowned for The Erie County Medical Center's specialization in transplantation, burn care, mental health services, and rehabilitation."
"Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity was founded in 1848 by Bishop John Timon: one of many charitable institutions Bishop John Timon put in place for the benefit of Buffalo's's Catholic community, which at the time consisted mostly of the desperately poor Irish immigrants of the First Ward. Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity was run at first by a staff of nuns from Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity (hence Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity's name) and moved to Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity's current location in Fillmore-Leroy in 1876. In the present day, Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity is the flagship facility of '''Catholic Health System of Buffalo''', with 586 beds between Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity's main location and Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity's branch hospital in Cheektowaga. Buffalo's first hospital, Sisters of Charity provides a wide range of medical and surgical care but is particularly well-known as an excellent maternity hospital."

These days, Bethesda World Harvest International Church's's not only a church in Bethesda World Harvest International Church's's own right where Bishop Michael Badger leads services every Sunday morning, but also the headquarters of the '''Bethesda Fellowship of Churches''', a nationwide network of religious communities specializing in humanitarian and missionary work in Africa."
"The dispute facing Bethel AME Church at the turn of the century — whether Bethel AME Church should continue meeting in the traditional heart of Buffalo's black community, or move away from what had since become a seedy red-light district — was so controversial that The dispute facing Bethel AME Church ended up splitting Bethel AME Church in half, giving birth in 1901 to what was first called '''St. Luke's AME Zion Church''' and later renamed in honor of Bethel AME Church's longtime Pastor, Rev. Henry Durham, after their longtime Pastor, Rev. Henry Durham's death.

"The friendly community of Faith Missionary Baptist Church has been led since 1981 by Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister: this pillar of The friendly community of Faith Missionary Baptist Church has not only ably stewarded Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister's congregation, expanding and modernizing Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister's church campus, but has also partnered with local not-for-profits and the city and county governments to establish educational, housing, and community service programs to benefit all residents of the East Side. Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister's church on Humboldt Parkway is the site of frequent fellowship meetings, potluck dinners, and other events to engage Pastor James R. Banks, who is much more than just a minister's flock and others far beyond Sunday mornings. The red neon cross that lights up Humboldt Parkway from the entrance may be unmistakably Christian, but the building that houses Faith Missionary Baptist Church started out as the nucleus of the early-20th Century Hamlin Park Jewish community: this was where Faith Missionary Baptist Church met until 1955. Faith Missionary Baptist Church's a handsome, beige brick building erected in 1924 in a style that mixes the Neoclassical with the Georgian Revival: the baskethandle arches atop the stained glass windows on the sides testify to the latter, while the latter is represented by a huge Palladian stained-glass window above the entrance that still boasts a proud Star of David in white and blue."

"Friendship Missionary Baptist Church is a neighborhood institution that's been going strong for over a century: Friendship Missionary Baptist Church has been housed in three separate buildings since Friendship Missionary Baptist Church's establishment in 1913, but true to the neighborhood that nurtured Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, three separate buildings have been located on or near Clinton Street in the Ellicott District. Almost as storied as the history of Friendship Missionary Baptist Church is the history of the welfare institutions Friendship Missionary Baptist Church's sponsored for the local area: from the community grocery store Friendship Missionary Baptist Church ran in the Depression years to Friendship Missionary Baptist Church's status as the first black church in Buffalo to evangelize over the radio airwaves beginning in the 1940s, and right through today with the community educational initiatives, food banks, and other programs maintained by Reverend Edward Jackson. But of course, the Sunday morning services, where longtime members as well as visitors are welcome to a seat at the table, remain the heart and soul of Friendship Missionary Baptist Church — the Sunday morning services, where longtime members as well as visitors are welcome to a seat at the table take place in a brick building dating from 1954 that, like Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, blends tradition with modernity."
"Macedonia Baptist Church's twin emphases are inclusivity and evangelism. Here, visitors and new members are not so much welcomed with open arms as infused with a sensation of suddenly finding one's long-lost family, which dovetails nicely with visitors and new members's goal of spreading the good news of visitors and new members's faith by engaging with the community in myriad different ways, at services as well as with scholarship programs, food drives, and other community betterment efforts. Pastor Herman Alston is the one who carries on Macedonia Baptist Church's's long tradition: founded in 1921, Macedonia Baptist Church's bounced around various locations around the area (including most notably a spell in the 1970s, '80s and '90s at the historic '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''') before landing in the old '''Masten Park Baptist Church''' on East North Street in the Fruit Belt: a simple yet striking English Gothic building erected in 1932 using local limestone."
"Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers, may have only been at the pulpit since 2015, but already Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers's making Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers's mark — a true man of the people, Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers's the living embodiment of Mount Moriah's's identity as Mount Moriah's"" — engaged, outgoing, and on friendly terms with the regulars in Mount Moriah's new pastor, Jeffrey Chambers's congregation. The place to be on Sunday mornings is the former '''Concordia Lutheran Church''' on Northampton Street in Cold Spring, an ample-sized, red-brick Gothic church built in 1903 to a design by local architect Jacob Oberkircher."
"Pastor Joe Fisher is the man of the hour ever Sunday morning at this pleasant, homey church in the Ellicott District. Pleasant Grove Baptist Church's history can be traced back to 1918, but Pleasant Grove Baptist Church's's present building is relatively newer: erected in 1977 from a design by Wallace Moll, one of the biggest names in the unsung late-20th Century Buffalo architectural community, Pleasant Grove Baptist Church's's interior is brightly lit and centered on a modern-style, cross-shaped stained glass window above the altar."
"Affiliated with the American Baptist Convention, St. John's is a congregation whose humble roots — the first service was helmed by Rev. Burnie McCarley in a tiny storefront in Broadway-Fillmore and attended by a congregation that numbered four — belie St. John's's modern-day status as a true mover and shaker among Buffalo's African-American faith community. As much a community service organization as a religious community, St. John's's 45-acre (18 ha) campus on the west edge of the Fruit Belt comprises not only the church itself — a colorful, brightly-lit, modern structure that's a well-known landmark in the blocks east of downtown — but also '''McCarley Gardens''', a development of 150 affordable townhouses that's about as well-kept and safe as public housing in Buffalo's gets, '''St. John Tower''', a nine-story senior citizens' apartment complex, and the '''Rev. Dr. Bennett W. Smith Family Life Center''', a large facility that hosts recreational and educational events open to Buffalo's African-American faith community."
"Without question, True Bethel Baptist Church is the preeminent African-American religious congregation in Buffalo — and without question, True Bethel Baptist Church's pastor, the Rev. Darius Pridgen, is Buffalo's most powerful black preacher, serving also as a philanthropist (True Bethel Baptist Church operates numerous charities including a food pantry, thrift shop, emergency housing service, and vocational rehabilitation for the homeless), preservationist (his financial backing was instrumental in the recently-completed restoration of the old '''Michigan Street Baptist Church'''), forceful mouthpiece for the African-American community in Buffalo, and, since 2011, in the city government as president of the Buffalo Common Council. True Bethel Baptist Church is actually three churches in one, with two locations in Buffalo and one in Niagara Falls, but this place's the East Ferry Street location that's the biggest — a huge megachurch the size of a Walmart, with an attached '''Subway''' sandwich shop and room for almost five thousand worshippers, the massive scale of this place is a perfect reflection of the outsize stature of this place's head honcho. The three services held here every Sunday are energetic, empowering, and speak to the contemporary concerns of modern-day African-Americans and Christians in general. And don't worry if you can't make it down for one of The three services held here every Sunday — you can also listen to services live on the radio on '''WUFO''' 1080 AM, or watch services live on the radio on '''WUFO''' 1080 AM on Time Warner Cable channel 20 or streaming on the Web."
"Located in the heart of Fillmore-Leroy since 1907, Blessed Trinity's congregation worships in an exquisite brown-brick building: Blessed Trinity's congregation's architecture an imitation of the '''Cathédrale Saint-Trophine''' in Arles adapted to the style of a 12th-century Lombard cathedral, Blessed Trinity's congregation's said to have the most plentiful terra cotta ornamentation of any church in the U.S."
"Second only to '''St. Stanislaus''' on the roster of Polonia's most prominent Catholic churches, Corpus Christi boasts a vibrant faith community, a full schedule of English- and Polish-language church services, and cultural events for the surrounding neighborhood including the annual '''Dożynki''' harvest festival held in August."
"The traditional church of Kaisertown's German community, St. Bernard's history dates back to 1907, before which time the newcomers had to either worship with the newcomers's Polish rivals at '''St. Casimir's''' or make the long trek across the railroad tracks to '''St. Agnes''' in Lovejoy. More recently, The traditional church of Kaisertown's German community, St. Bernard's successfully fought off an attempt by the Diocese to merge The traditional church of Kaisertown's German community, St. Bernard's with '''Our Lady of Czestochowa''' in Cheektowaga, and The traditional church of Kaisertown's German community, St. Bernard's remains today the home of a congregation that's on the small side, but vital and welcoming to all."
"St. Casimir is no longer a full-fledged parish: in 2011, St. Casimir's congregation was merged with '''Our Lady of Czestochowa''' in Cheektowaga and the building became an '''oratory''', or a secondary worship space used by St. Casimir's parent church for special-event Masses, weddings, funerals, and other functions. However, as oratories go, St. Casimir's is an unusually active one: St. Casimir hosts six Masses a week as well as a full slate of community events and services (including a raucous '''Dyngus Day''' shindig) that preserve St. Casimir's status as the nexus of Kaisertown's Polish community."
"The story of this proud congregation is the story of the historic linchpin churches of two adjacent but very different neighborhoods: '''St. Brigid's''', founded in 1853 as the ""mother church"" of the Irish immigrant community of South Buffalo and located for years on Louisiana Street in the Old First Ward, and '''St. Columba''', which served the Italians of the Ellicott District beginning in 1888 and was famous for years as the site of the '''Printers' Mass''', an extra-late service at 1:30AM on Sunday nights held especially for the newspaper printers whose shifts ended just before that hour. the historic linchpin churches of two adjacent but very different neighborhoods merged in 1968 after '''St. Brigid's''''s was destroyed by fire, and today SS. Columba and Brigid is a friendly and welcoming Near East Side church with a congregation that draws heavily from the newly minted Hispanic quarter of the Ellicott District, and which strives to use a congregation that draws heavily from the newly minted Hispanic quarter of the Ellicott District's ""contagious Christianity"" as a positive force in the lives of all who enter."
"St. John Kanty has been anchoring the eastern part of Broadway-Fillmore since 1890, when Bishop Stephen Ryan had had enough of hearing about parishioners of '''St. Stanislaus''' killed on their walk to church while crossing the dangerous '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks that divided the eastern part of Broadway-Fillmore. Despite the fact that St. John Kanty's building lacks the architectural majesty of many of Polonia's older churches, St. John Kanty counts a congregation that's among the East Side's most vibrant — aside from the half-dozen Masses held here each week, St. John Kanty remains a powerful force in Buffalo's Polish community through St. John Kanty's sponsorship of a bevy of community services for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. St. John Kanty continues to grow, too, accepting the former members of '''St. Adalbert's Basilica''' into the fold when the two churches merged in 2011."
"St. Katharine Drexel is a new parish, formed in 2007 from the merger of Lovejoy's three Catholic churches: '''St. Agnes''', '''Visitation''', and '''St. Francis of Assisi'''. The new congregation meets in the former home of the latter church, a newish building in a modernized and simplified interpretation of the English Gothic style that's stood on North Ogden Street since 1959. As well, the new name of St. Katharine Drexel is a sort of homage to St. Katharine Drexel's former namesake: canonized in 2000, St. Katharine Drexel is a new-school saint who, in turn-of-the-century Philadelphia, worked tirelessly in the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi for the benefit of the urban poor and against the racial segregation and prejudice that ruled the day."
"St. Lawrence Church is located just inside the city line in Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles. '''St. Gerard''', located at the intersection that gave Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles its name, was their church, but as Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles grew in population Delavan-Bailey, which at the turn of the century stood out among East Side neighborhoods as an island of Italian immigrants in a sea of Germans and Poles became too small to accommodate all the congregants. Thus St. Lawrence Church was founded as a mission church in 1914, graduating to the status of full-fledged parish in St. Lawrence Church's own right in 1929. Today St. Lawrence Church is a small but diverse and friendly congregation that's welcoming to visitors and active in the community."
"From the 1990s through today, the story of the Catholic churches on the inner East Side was one of shrinking congregations and of churches closing and merging with each other. St. Martin de Porres is one of the inner East Side's first ""blended churches"" — a merger of '''St. Matthew''' in Genesee-Moselle, '''Our Lady of Lourdes''' in Midtown, '''St. Boniface''' in the Fruit Belt, and '''St. Benedict the Moor''' in Cold Spring — and it's unique among them in that the merger came at the request of the parishes, rather than being imposed on the parishes by the Diocese. When the building St. Martin de Porres call home today was dedicated by Bishop Henry Mansell in 2000, the building they call home today was the first new Catholic church in 50 years to be built within the city limits. Another way St. Martin de Porres is unique is as Buffalo's only majority-black Catholic church, and among the ways St. Martin de Porres tailors St. Martin de Porres's ministry to the worship culture St. Martin de Porres serves is with a rousing gospel choir headed since Buffalo's only majority-black Catholic church's inception by the inimitable Ella Robinson, as well as an '''African-American Catholic Gospel Music Resource and Recording Center''' slated for the Parish Center St. Martin de Porres plan to build on St. Martin de Porres's Humboldt Park campus."
"The most well-known and vibrant Catholic church on the East Side, this ""Mother Church of Polonia"" has stubbornly retained St. Stan's's status as central hub of the community in Broadway-Fillmore. St. Stan's is best known among locals as a place to celebrate Dyngus Day or trek with your old Polish grandma on Easter, Christmas and other holidays — but St. Stan's's an equally magnificent experience other times of the year, when it's just you and the neighborhood regulars. For an extra dose of old-school neighborhood authenticity, go to St. Stan's's Polish-language service, held at noon every Sunday."
"The seat of the Buffalo Deanery of the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''', St. Nicholas serves a cluster of Ukrainians located in Lovejoy whose history dates back to the early 1880s. It was Reverend Iwan Zaklynskyj who was the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''''s founding father — in 1905, Reverend Iwan Zaklynskyj and a group that broke away from the congregation of '''SS. Peter & Paul''' on Ideal Street after the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''''s ethnic composition shifted began meeting in a small wood-frame structure on Central Avenue. The present building, a Romanesque-style beauty in Broadway-Fillmore designed by prominent East Side architect Wladyslaw Zawadzki, dates to 1919. Today, St. Nicholas — along with the '''Dnipro Center''' on Genesee Street — is one of the twin nuclei of Buffalo's under-the-radar but vibrant Ukrainian-American community: the '''Ukrainian Catholic Church''' plays host not only to weekly services but also fun-filled community events and, on Friday afternoons, to the '''St. Nicholas Friday Kitchen''', where ''varenyky'', ''borscht'', and other lip-smacking Ukrainian specialties are dished out for a song. St. Nicholas is also the sponsor of the ""Good Samaritan"" radio show broadcast Sunday afternoons on '''WJJL 1440 AM''', broadcasting inspirational religious programming in both Ukrainian and English."
"Though The congregation was founded in 1884 as a Ukrainian congregation, SS. Peter & Paul became dominated in short order by Russians, who began immigrating to Buffalo in the 1880s and were attracted to Lovejoy due to easily available jobs on the railroads. The departure of the Ukrainians for a separate congregation in 1905 cemented SS. Peter & Paul's status as the first Russian Orthodox church on the Niagara Frontier (these days The congregation's affiliated with the '''Orthodox Church in America'''). The congregation continued to grow throughout the 20th Century and into the 21st, accommodating an influx of refugees from the former Soviet Union, and the richly decorated Russian Byzantine-style building in which The congregation meets today, with its unmistakable onion dome, dates to 1933. Visitors to SS. Peter & Paul today will encounter a congregation that is close-knit yet welcoming to newcomers, with uplifting services held in a mix of English and Old Slavonic."
"A small and close-knit faith community whose ethnic diversity mirrors that of the neighborhood this church calls home, this church was founded in 1925 as the '''Cleveland Hill Evangelical United Brethren Church''' and has worshiped in this church's present building, a simple, modern-style brick and stone church in Kensington-Bailey, since 1949. Today, Pastor Holly Dale-Coty leads a congregation that is active in A small and close-knit faith community whose ethnic diversity mirrors that of the neighborhood it calls home and enthusiastically welcoming of visitors and newcomers."
"The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''' has been a mainstay in Delavan-Grider for over a century: The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''' still worships in The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''''s original brick Carpenter Gothic building erected in 1915. Today, Pastor Larry Jackson leads Sunday services that are friendly and imbued with a positive and uplifting message, and continues the tradition of community engagement that's been one of The church formerly known as '''Grace Reformed Church''''s trademarks from the start: potluck dinners, lively choir concerts, and other events are frequent and well-attended."
"Affiiliated with the Lutheran Church — Missouri Synod, Hananiah is a new congregation that's led by Reverend Kenyatta Cobb, who doubles as a chaplain for the Buffalo Police Department and the '''Erie County Medical Center'''. Since 2007, Hananiah've been based in the former '''A. L. Weber Furniture Store''' on Genesee Street in Humboldt Park, with services whose style blends respect for tradition with innovations that speak to modern Christians. Hananiah is a small congregation, but Hananiah boasts an outsize commitment to community service — Hananiah's food pantry serves the neighborhood Monday through Thursday — and an ethnically diverse makeup."
"Affiliated with the Karen Baptist Convention, it was in 2015 when pastor Myo Kyow moved pastor Myo Kyow's flock from their former home on the West Side to the erstwhile '''St. James Catholic Church''' in Kensington-Bailey: a hulking English Gothic structure designed by Karl Schmill and built in 1926 for a mixed German and Irish congregation on what was then the outskirts of Buffalo's urbanized area. As before, Hermon Karen Baptist serves as spiritual home to a growing contingent of Buffalo's's Burmese immigrant community, whom pastor Myo Kyow and company actively engage with friendly services, a host of worthwhile events, and group meetings sponsored by a wide range of community groups."
"Immanuel is a pint-sized congregation — over the course of Immanuel's history, Immanuel's never had much more than the two or three dozen members Immanuel boasts now — so it's pretty impressive that Immanuel has been able to hang tough in Lovejoy for over 120 years. Immanuel was founded in 1894 with services held in German for the first twenty years of Immanuel's history, and Immanuel moved to Immanuel's current location — the former '''St. Peter's Episcopal Church''' — in 1951. Headed up today by pastor Glen Richardson, Immanuel may be a small church, but the community is friendly and welcoming to visitors. Immanuel's affiliated with the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church."
"Lincoln Memorial UMC is a handsome stone church in the English Gothic style, built in 1921 for the '''Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church''' and situated in a verdant milieu in Hamlin Park. At Lincoln Memorial UMC, not only does the congregation bend over backwards to welcome and accommodate newcomers, but Pastor George Nicholas is uncommonly talented at crafting sermons whose messages cut across all types of people and walks of life to touch all hearts. There's even a coffee hour after services."
"Founded in 1920 as the '''Bailey Avenue Presbyterian Church''' and renamed six years later after the death of their founding pastor, MacAlpine has been a tried-and-true stalwart in Kensington-Bailey all throughout the changes Kensington-Bailey has undergone over the years. Reverend Lowell Avery is a true dynamo, leading Reverend Lowell Avery's church not only in rousing Sunday-morning services but in a full range of community programs and ministries."
"Much the same as '''St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church''' just on the other side of Humboldt Parkway, the story of Metropolitan UMC is one of five struggling, shrinking inner-city congregations — '''St. Andrew's''', '''Bithynia''', '''Good Shepherd''', '''Masten Community''', and '''Otterbein''' — pooling their resources and merging together to keep the flame of their faith alive in the midst of a changing neighborhood. The building, erected in 1981 on the site of the demolished '''Humboldt Square Evangelical Church''' (later temporary home to predecessor congregation Good Shepherd), is a handsome building in a modernist style; the congregation is small and tight-knit yet friendly and welcoming; the services are helmed weekly by Pastor Angela Stewart."
"Like '''Durham Memorial AME Zion Church''', New Covenant UCC's history can be traced back to the controversy among members of '''Bethel AME Church''' over the undesirable location of members of '''Bethel AME Church''''s place of worship in what was then Buffalo's red-light district. Desiring to go one step beyond Durham's solution and dispense with Methodism entirely, New Covenant UCC's was founded in 1904 and met in a converted house on Potter Street (now Nash Street) donated by one Mr. William Lloyd, hence New Covenant UCC's's original name '''one Mr. William Lloyd's Memorial Congregational Church'''. New Covenant UCC's moved to New Covenant UCC's's present building in the Ellicott District in 1964 and took on New Covenant UCC's's current name ten years later after merging with '''St. Peter's Evangelical Church'''. New Covenant UCC's remains a very active congregation both at Sunday services and in the community at large, with a neighborhood food pantry, an active music ministry, and frequent guest speakers and other events. New Covenant UCC's is very welcoming to visitors and new members, too."
"Though you'd never know it from St. Philip's's low-key reputation, St. Philip's is one of the East Side's most historic churches: founded in 1861, St. Philip's is one of the East Side's's oldest extant congregations, and was the first (and is still the only) majority-black congregation in the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York. They worshiped for years on Goodell Street in the Fruit Belt before their building fell victim to urban renewal in 1974, and their current home is the former '''St. Clement's Episcopal Church''' in Delavan-Grider. Services at St. Philip's's blend the traditionally Episcopalian with twists that speak to the African-American identity of St. Philip's's members — for example, there's both a traditional and a gospel choir — and St. Philip's's is also the home church of the local chapter of the '''Union of Black Episcopalians'''. There are two services a week led by the dynamic Rev. Gloria Payne-Carter."
"With a history that stretches back to 1918, the University Methodist Church has been a linchpin presence at the north end of Kensington-Bailey for far longer than most anything else in Kensington-Bailey. Though services are still held in the University Methodist Church's original, imposing red-brick Gothic building, the University Methodist Church is now linked together with the nearby '''Cleveland Hill United Methodist Church''' — the two congregations share the same pastor, the Rev. Holly Dale-Coty, as well as the same outsize vitality and spirit of community engagement that belie the small size of the flock, and the same warm welcome for visitors."
"In 2014, the erstwhile '''Expressway Assembly of God''' — located in Kensington-Bailey, in an old factory building just off the Eggert Road exit of the '''Kensington Expressway''', hence its name — became part of the CityReach Network, a group of several dozen churches located throughout the eastern United States whose mission is to bring the Christian message to ""unlikely people in overlooked place"". Accordingly, Pastor Lou Krutz and Pastor Lou Krutz's cohorts foster an accepting, low-key, come-as-you-are environment in Pastor Lou Krutz and his cohorts's services, with a special focus on ministering to youth and young adults: a nursery and Children's Church are available during regular Sunday services, and teens and young adults are catered to during Tuesday and Wednesday night programs, respectively. In order to represent Pastor Lou Krutz and his cohorts's faith to the community in the best possible way, the CityReach Network, a group of several dozen churches located throughout the eastern United States goes far beyond simply welcoming new members: the CityReach Network, a group of several dozen churches located throughout the eastern United States actively and enthusiastically encourage visitors to check out what visitors're all about."
"In the beginning, the church was the '''First Russian-Ukrainian Baptist Church''', where a few dozen people met each week to conduct services in the Russian language. As the '''First Russian-Ukrainian Baptist Church''', where a few dozen people met each week to conduct services in the Russian language changed and diversified, the church began accepting folks of other ethnicities into the fold and holding services in English; finally, in 1951, the much larger congregation moved into the striking modern building the worship in today. Despite that, the core message has remained the same: the church is a friendly, fundamentalist Christian congregation that's extraordinarily committed to the church's faith. Pastor John Carpenter leads weekly services at which all are welcome."
"An interdenominational, full-Gospel Christian congregation that is welcoming and open to all, at the First Universal Christian Church husband-and-wife pastor team Rob and Sue Bradbury preach services with a positive, empowering message, with a contemporary-style delivery that's not bogged down in intimidating pomp and ceremony but is laid-back, accessible, and relevant to modern-day life. The building is the former '''Magyar Reformed Church''', a charming red-brick Gothic church built in 1915 where the small Hungarian community of eastern Kaisertown worshiped for many years."
"Situated in the former '''John Ulinski Senior Center''' at the corner of Stanislaus Street and Woltz Avenue in Broadway-Fillmore, the Buffalo Markaz Masjid is not only as a mosque where ''taleem'' (and, on Friday, ''jum'a'') is held each evenings after ''isha'', but also serves as the local headquarters and community center of '''Tablighi Jamaat''', a conservative Sunni tradition that emphasizes missionary work within the larger Muslim community."
"A Salafi mosque and community center located in a storefront in the heart of Genesee-Moselle, the Islamic Da'Wah Center of Buffalo hosts all prayers except formal ''jum'a'' for a multicultural congregation."
"Jami Masjid is located in the building that was for eighty years the home of '''Queen of Peace Catholic Church''', founded in 1920 to serve a small Polish enclave that had migrated northeastward from Broadway-Fillmore. The building dates to seven years after '''Queen of Peace Catholic Church''', founded in 1920 to serve a small Polish enclave that had migrated northeastward from Broadway-Fillmore was established, a sandstone and limestone edifice in a pleasant English Gothic style whose design was unique among all the city's Catholic churches: church, school and rectory were combined in one large cross-shaped structure. Today the church portion is where Sheikh Ibrahim Memon leads one of Buffalo's largest Muslim congregations in Friday prayers, while the school portion of The building is now home to the '''Universal School''', which provides a private Islamic education in the Sunni tradition to elementary- and middle school-aged students."
"Masjid Darus-Salaam is located in Humboldt Park, in a converted house on a quiet side street next to next to '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' — look for the smallish sign hanging from the porch on the second floor. Masjid Darus-Salaam may look small at first, but Masjid Darus-Salaam's got enough space for about 75 people for ''jum'a'' as well as an extensive library of Qu'ran translations, ''hadith'' collections, and other Islamic literature available for study. In addition to Friday services, Masjid Darus-Salaam also hosts a wide variety of other prayer meetings, religious education courses, and activities on a seven-day-a-week basis."
"Among the oldest mosques in Buffalo, Nu'Man is a primarily African-American congregation that meets in a space on the second floor of a brown-brick commercial building in the heart of Humboldt Park. Friday ''jum'a'' (in the Sunni tradition) is attended by a vibrant, loving congregation that's well-known for a vibrant, loving congregation that's well-known for its engagement in community betterment in a myriad of different ways's engagement in community betterment in a myriad of different ways, while on Sunday mornings Islamic studies classes are offered for both children and adults."
"Like '''Jami Masjid''', this is another example of a former Christian church converted into a combination mosque and Muslim school: in 1993, the former '''Holy Mother of the Rosary Polish National Cathedral''' in Broadway-Fillmore became the home of '''Masjid Zakariya''' and '''Masjid Zakariya''''s associated school, the '''Darul-Uloom Al-Madania Institute of Higher Islamic Education'''. At '''Masjid Zakariya''', ''jum'a'' and other services are held for a congregation composed of about a hundred families, mostly immigrants from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; in '''Masjid Zakariya''', students from pre-kindergarten through grade 10 are educated in a combination of the standard New York State curriculum and rigorous study of the principles of the Sunni Islamic faith."
"Located in the Buffalo Police Department's former '''Eighth Precinct Headquarters''', Chùa Từ Hiếu has served the local Vietnamese Buddhist community since 1998, but it was not until 2014 — when the breathtaking outdoor courtyard and garden were put in place next door — when Chùa Từ Hiếu truly came to the attention of the local Vietnamese Buddhist community. Decorated with a set of stone pillars imported from Vietnam and centered on a statue of Quan Âm, the ''bodhisattva'' of mercy to whom many refugees prayed for safe travel to many refugees's new homeland, Chùa Từ Hiếu periodically becomes the scene of cultural events and gatherings such as group meditation sessions and an annual Vietnamese New Year celebration featuring traditional music and dance. Otherwise, Chùa Từ Hiếu is open for worship daily."
"Tu Viện Đại Bảo Trang Nghiêm sees the former '''St. Agnes Catholic Church''' in Lovejoy reborn as a complex that combines a thriving Buddhist monastery, worship space and cultural center with the head offices of the '''International Sangha Bhiksu Buddhist Association'''. The temple is open to the public daily for silent prayer and on Sundays and Mondays for group chanting and meditation, and also hosts Vietnamese language classes for children and various cultural events."

"The Emirates Towers complex contains the Emirates Office Tower and Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel. The two towers, which rise to 355 m (1,165 ft) and 309 m (1,014 ft), respectively, stand as the 23rd and 47th tallest buildings in the world. The two towers, which rise to 355 m (1,165 ft) and 309 m (1,014 ft) are connected by a 9,000 m² (96,875 ft²) two-storey retail complex known as ""The Boulevard"". The Emirates Towers complex is located on the Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and is a symbol of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A curiosity of the design is that The two towers, which rise to 355 m (1,165 ft) and 309 m (1,014 ft) have a similar number of floors; the taller office tower actually contains 54 floors, while Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel contains 56 floors.

Hatta's capital town, also named Hatta, includes a reconstructed heritage village by the same name. Hatta is about 115 km (71 mi) east of Dubai City. Because of Hatta's altitude, Hatta has a milder climate than Dubai City, making Hatta a popular vacation place for Dubai City residents. a reconstructed heritage village by the same name includes two prominent military towers from the 18th century and the Juma mosque (built in 1780), the oldest building in Hatta, as well as about 30 loam houses. a reconstructed heritage village by the same name displays scenes from everyday life in the past.

Each country/region has Each country/region's own pavilion with a unique replica of Each country/region's famous landmark(s). This is usually like a flea market where you can get souvenirs from almost every corner of the earth for a bargained price and experience as if you're in that certain country for at least 10 minutes of your life even if you're 10,000&nbsp;km away.

"The Black Rock Historical Society's small storefront exhibit space opened in May 2015 in a building The Black Rock Historical Society's share with the '''Black Rock Riverside Alliance''', and The Black Rock Historical Society's's exhibits represent ten years of acquisition by museum curator Mark Kubiniec from both museum curator Mark Kubiniec's personal collection and donations from neighborhood residents and businesses. Through a series of historic photographs, artifacts, and other exhibits, the 200-year story of the Black Rock, Riverside, Grant-Amherst, and West Hertel neighborhoods — one of the most historic areas of Buffalo — is recounted. The Black Rock Historical Society's also offers brochures for several self-guided walking tours around the Black Rock, Riverside, Grant-Amherst, and West Hertel neighborhoods — one of the most historic areas of Buffalo —, covering everything from historic sites from the War of 1812 to modern-day community gardens."
"This delightful cottage on Edward Street is where Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, lived from Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s birth in 1864 to Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s matriculation at '''Wells College''' about 1880. Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s father Oscar Folsom, a prominent lawyer, died at a young age in a carriage accident, whereupon Frances' father Oscar Folsom, a prominent lawyer,'s friend and colleague, Grover Cleveland, took on the responsibility of caring for Frances' father Oscar Folsom, a prominent lawyer,'s widow and two daughters. Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s relationship with Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, would blossom into a romance, culminating in their marriage in 1886, the first and still the only presidential wedding to ever take place at the White House. Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, was immensely popular — the public was struck by Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s beauty, poise and intelligence, and ladies of the day slavishly copied Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s fashion sense — and Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s still the youngest First Lady in U.S. history. Though the house at Edward Street is not open for tours, the city has placed an interpretive plaque in front of This delightful cottage on Edward Street with details on Frances Folsom Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland,'s life, historical importance, and legacy. Architecture buffs will also take note of this fine example of the mid-19th Century red brick Italianates that remain popular on the Lower West Side."

As well, a modest selection of books on local history and art are available for sale."
"Opened in February 2014 in a temporary space with ""Blow"", a joint exhibition of paintings, photographs and sculpture by a quartet of local artists which had as its theme Buffalo's long, bleak winters, the Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery (BT&C for short) moved four months later into the Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery (BT&C for short)'s permanent gallery on Niagara Street in the Upper West Side, a converted warehouse that's also home to '''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery''' and is across the street from the new headquarters of '''Sugar City'''. Under the careful direction of Anna Kaplan, whose pedigree in the local arts community has included stints as curatorial assistant at the '''Albright-Knox Art Gallery''' and on the faculty of '''Daemen College''''s fine arts department, the Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery (BT&C for short)'s focus is not only on hosting exhibitions of minimalist, abstract contemporary art in a diversity of media, but also — contrary to the majority of other Buffalo's galleries whose promotional focus is strictly on the local market — to work actively in the marketing of local artists to galleries and collectors outside Western New York."
"Located at the former '''St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church''' in the heart of historic Black Rock, the mission of the Buffalo Religious Arts Center is to salvage and display some of the works of religious art contained in the many churches and other places of worship (particularly on the East Side) that have closed the many churches and other places of worship (particularly on the East Side)'s doors in the wake of Buffalo's half-century of population loss. In addition to the priceless works from other churches that curator Mary Holland has collected, such as statuary from '''St. Mary of Sorrows''', icons from '''SS. Peter & Paul Russian Orthodox Church''', and various items from '''Temple Beth El''', St. Francis Xavier itself is a magnificent old building full of beautiful and uplifting art which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was a longtime cornerstone of the historic Black Rock community."
"A complex of four buildings that serve as living quarters as well as studio and exhibition space for painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, and all manner of other artists, the Essex Arts Center has been a mainstay on the West Side for four decades running. the Essex Arts Center traces the Essex Arts Center's history back to 1969, when local steel sculptor Larry Griffis and local steel sculptor Larry Griffis's Ashford Hollow Foundation, which was established three years previously to administer the 400-acre (160 ha) sculpture park local steel sculptor Larry Griffis'd established in Cattaraugus County, purchased the former '''Webster-Citizens Company Ice House''' to use as an arts studio and performance venue. the Essex Arts Center immediately attracted to the Essex Arts Center's roster a veritable Who's Who of Buffalo's arts scene of the 1970s and '80s, and over the years the Essex Arts Center has proven to be an incredibly prolific incubator of institutions that have gone on to become major players in the local arts scene — '''Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the '''CEPA Gallery''', and the dearly missed '''Artists' Committee Gallery''' all got '''Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the '''CEPA Gallery''', and the dearly missed '''Artists' Committee Gallery''''s start at 30 Essex before striking out on '''Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the '''CEPA Gallery''', and the dearly missed '''Artists' Committee Gallery''''s own, and '''Big Orbit Gallery''', founded in 1991 and described below, carries on the tradition at '''Big Orbit Gallery''', founded in 1991 and described below's original location. Besides 'Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center''', the Essex Arts Center also hosts frequent events such as art auctions, musical performances, and educational workshops and seminars whose proceeds go directly to benefit the local arts community."
"Established in 1991, Big Orbit Gallery is a collective run by and for artists, featuring a changing schedule of experimental exhibitions in a diversity of media. This expansive gallery — situated in a former warehouse whose high ceiling, adjacent interior courtyard, and minimalist decor lend Big Orbit Gallery a cavernous, airy ambience — features diverse exhibitions of works by local artists. Everything from traditional media like painting and photography, to performance art and sound sculpture, to genre-defying, avant-garde spectacle of all kinds can be found here. diverse exhibitions of works by local artists are united by diverse exhibitions of works by local artists's transcendence of cultures and viewpoints: Big Orbit Gallery prides Big Orbit Gallery not only on bringing established artists from the Buffalo area to the national and international stage, but also on building awareness of emerging artists of underrepresented demographics. A word of warning: updates to Big Orbit Gallery's website are sporadic at best, so Facebook or the pages of ''Artvoice'' are probably better bets for those who want to see what's on at Big Orbit Gallery."
"This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill is part private residence, part archaeological dig and part art gallery: award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher bought This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill in 2009 when This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill was on This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill's demolition list and has been living in and renovating This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill ever since, a process that has yielded a treasure trove of salvaged structural and decorative elements that award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher assembles — along with found items from thrift stores, flea markets, and other sources — into imaginative collages displayed in the gallery space on This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill's first floor. This ongoing project has earned award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher praise from the '''New York Foundation for the Arts''' and in the pages of the ''New York Times'', among others. Aside from award-winning artist, architect, author and UB professor Dennis Maher's own work, This handsome old Victorian in Prospect Hill also occasionally hosts exhibitions by other artists from the local area."
"Sugar City is the loose arts collective that's been best known recently for Sugar City's impromptu ""guerrilla""-style art shows and performances that have popped up at various spots around town over the two-year interval between Sugar City's departure from Sugar City's former home on Wadsworth Street in Allentown and the grand opening of Sugar City's new one in the Upper West Side. True to Sugar City's usual nature, most of the renovation work at their new one in the Upper West Side was performed by the seven ""Sugar Citizens"" Sugar City, but it wouldn't be exactly accurate to pin the ""DIY"" label on Sugar City: Sugar City's community-based, participatory approach to art would be better described as ""do art together"". The exhibit space in Sugar City's front room is given over to those artists who cannot obtain space in more traditional galleries, with an aim of blurring the lines and redefining what is and is not considered art. There's probably no way to describe the exhibits you'll find here, other than to say the exhibits you'll find here are the misfits of town's art scene whose creative output defies categorization, so expect the unexpected."
"The humble '''West Side Value Laundromat''' on Massachusetts Avenue is hardly the place you'd expect to be a reliable clearinghouse for information on community cultural happenings, let alone the venue for art studio space, a small library, and a wide gamut of artistic and cultural events. Yet that's exactly what the WASH Project (the acronym stands for ""Westside Art Strategy Happenings"") consists of. Owner Zaw Win, one of the West Side's growing legion of Burmese refugees who boasts a long history of political activism in Owner Zaw Win, one of the West Side's growing legion of Burmese refugees who boasts a long history of political activism in his home country's home country, teamed up in 2012 with local activist Barrett Gordon and financial benefactors including '''Houghton College''' and the local chapter of '''AmeriCorps''' to turn Owner Zaw Win, one of the West Side's growing legion of Burmese refugees who boasts a long history of political activism in his home country's laundromat into a beehive of community cultural life where the accent, not surprisingly, is on the diverse patchwork of ethnic groups that have forged a cohesive community on the West Side's. At the WASH Project (the acronym stands for ""Westside Art Strategy Happenings"")'s small gallery, you can peruse monthly changing exhibitions of work by local artists, attend classes and workshops on a wide range of artistic subjects, create your own masterpiece in the ""Creative Spin"" studio (chalk art on the sidewalk outside the building is popular during the warmer months) — and maybe throw in a load of laundry while you're at the ""Creative Spin"" studio (chalk art on the sidewalk outside the building is popular during the warmer months).

"With a moniker that pays tribute to the newfound ambition and vigor in Buffalo (and particularly on the emerging stretch of Niagara Street where the brewery is located), the brewery opened in June 2014 in the wake of $1 million in renovations to the former '''Sterling Engine Company''' warehouse that's also home to the offices of '''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''' and the '''BT&C Gallery'''. Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins are Buffalo natives who've put to work Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins's extensive experience in the brewing industry and research of beer culture across North America in the manufacture of premium-quality craft beers in Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins's own hometown. the brewery's goal for Co-owners Jeff Ware and Dave Collins's first year is to produce 3,000 barrels of over a hundred different brews, ranging from standards such as Belgian tripel, saison and India pale ale to locally-themed flavors such as ""Loganberry Wit"" and ""Sponge Candy Stout"". Also in the pipeline is a pilot brewing program, where beer buffs can dream up beer buffs's own recipes, have a few small batches brewed and sampled by customers, with the potential for those that prove most popular to earn a permanent slot on the menu."
"Broderick Park is a small waterfront green space located at the southern tip of Unity Island. Broderick Park is historically important as one of Western New York's major crossing points into Canada for fugitive slaves travelling the Underground Railroad, as attested to by a prominent historical marker and the occasional historical reenactments that take place there. Broderick Park was also the site from which the ferry service to Fort Erie, Ontario set off in the days before the '''Peace Bridge'''. Today, Broderick Park is a popular fishing spot where perch, yellow and northern pike, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, and other species native to the Niagara River are reeled in, and is also a haven for picnickers, sunbathers, and bicyclists who pass through Broderick Park along the '''Shoreline Trail'''. Amenities include a picnic shelter, as well as a newly constructed amphitheater, gardens, and interpretive exhibits. Broderick Park is also the northern terminus of the '''Bird Island Pier''' (see below)."
"One of Buffalo's many Olmsted parks, Front Park (or ""The Front"", as the park was originally named) is situated along '''Porter Avenue''' just south of the '''Peace Bridge''' and contains a soccer field, tennis courts, and picnic facilities, as well as original features such as ""The Hippodrome"", a 3.5-acre (1.5 ha) lawn intended for picnicking or informal team sports, and a terrace concourse for carriages adorned with a handsome statue of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Intended to both showcase and enhance the beauty of the Niagara River and Lake Erie and emphasize the Niagara River and Lake Erie's significance to the history and identity of Buffalo's, the park once also boasted extensive formal gardens. At the north end of the park stood '''Fort Porter''', built in the mid-1840s as a customshouse and military installation. Some time later, Olmsted was given the green light to this extension the Front beyond the canal to the edge of the river the Niagara River; though this extension never materialized, this extension would have included playgrounds, a beach, and a boardwalk. Sadly, together with the West Side's other Olmsted park, '''Riverside Park''', the park was badly damaged by the urban renewal that decimated the West Side's in the middle 20th Century: the construction of Interstate 190 over the former canal bed robbed the concourse of the former canal bed's serene lake views, and the construction of the new plaza for the '''Peace Bridge''' in 1951 culled seven acres (2.5ha) from the size of the park, resulted in the demolition of '''Fort Porter''', built in the mid-1840s as a customshouse and military installation, and routed noisy trucks bound for Canada through the park (the latter problem will be solved by the controversial expansion of the the '''Peace Bridge''' plaza slated for the next few years, after which trucks will access the '''Peace Bridge''' from a new entrance away from the park)."
"Though not an Olmsted park, LaSalle Park is the largest park along Buffalo's waterfront, and LaSalle Park's plethora of amenities — baseball diamonds, soccer fields, a swimming pool, a skate park, and a dog run (""The Barkyard"") — have made LaSalle Park popular among locals. LaSalle Park was named Centennial Park when LaSalle Park opened to visitors in 1932, Buffalo's's 100th year as a city. Later, of course, LaSalle Park's name was changed to honor the French explorer René-Robert Cavalier de La Salle, whose ship ''Le Griffon'' passed along the Lake Erie shore in 1679, the first European to see Buffalo's. Architecture buffs will enjoy the Buffalo Water Authority's historic '''Colonel Francis G. Ward Pumping Station''', built between 1909 and 1915 to a design by the local firm of Esenwein & Johnson in a style that's an eclectic hybrid of Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism and the Romanesque Revival."
"Situated on 39 acres (16 ha) in the far northwest corner of the city, Riverside Park features facilities for every outdoor activity imaginable: baseball diamonds, football and soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts, a swimming pool, a playground, and the '''Ruben ""Bud"" Bakewell Ice Rink'''. Riverside Park was the last addition to the city's Olmsted park system — Riverside Park was not conceived and built until after Frederick Law Olmsted's death, commissioned by the city in 1898 and designed by Frederick Law Olmsted's's two sons. Riverside Park was intended to finally fulfill Frederick Law Olmsted's's dream of a true waterfront park for the city and included all the classic Olmsted elements — a meadow, footpaths, wooded thickets, and a carriage concourse — as well as pleasant minnow pools along Riverside Park's northern boundary. Riverside Park was to have been connected to the rest of Buffalo's Olmsted park system by '''Roesch Avenue''', a parkway leading north and west from Delaware Park which was never built. Sadly, Riverside Park is probably the least well-preserved of the city's Olmsted parks today, owing to the construction of Interstate 190 along the canal bed and the removal of many of the historic Olmsted features. However, the scenic overlook still provides a stunning view over the Niagara River (with direct access to the shore provided by the '''Irene K. Gardner Pedestrian Bridge''' over the expressway), and the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy recently unveiled '''River Rock Gardens''' on the former site of pleasant minnow pools along its northern boundary, now reinterpreted as a large chain of stone-bedded rain gardens peppered with greenery, traversed by footpaths, and centered on an elegant stone arch bridge."
"The Bird Island Pier dates from 1822, when The Bird Island Pier was built as a buffer between the Erie Canal and the rough waters of the Niagara River, and was once a lively place of fishing shacks, canal boats, and pleasure steamers bound for Canada and Grand Island. Though fishing shacks, canal boats, and pleasure steamers bound for Canada and Grand Island are long-gone, The Bird Island Pier recently completed an extensive renovation and structural stabilization and, for the first time in three years, is now completely reopened as a scenic pedestrian walkway. Proceeding southward from '''Broderick Park''' past the '''Peace Bridge''' and onward to a point parallel to '''LaSalle Park''' — 1.3 miles (2 km) in all — walkers can experience an unparalleled view of the Niagara River and Fort Erie to all — walkers's right, then turn all — walkers's head and watch rowing crews from Canisius, St. Joe's, and other area high schools set off along the Erie Canal from the '''West Side Rowing Club'''. At the end, you're treated to a waterfront panorama that is simply without equal, with the '''Erie Basin Marina''' in the foreground and the downtown skyline and grain elevators off in the distance."
"Founded in 1992 by West Side residents, the Massachusetts Avenue Project's vision encompasses access to affordable and nutritious food for all, the transformation of blighted urban areas into productive green space, community education, and economic betterment on a grassroots level. the Massachusetts Avenue Project's's centerpiece is the '''Growing Green Urban Farm''', the first one in Buffalo, located on thirteen vacant lots totalling more than an acre (4,000 square meters) in area. Produce is grown in a large greenhouse as well as expansive garden beds, and the Massachusetts Avenue Project's also features a small orchard of fruit trees, free-range chickens, and a fish hatchery — all kept green by a state-of-the-art, rainwater-fed aquaponics system installed in 2009. Farm work is performed by local youths recruited through the '''Mayor's Summer Youth Program''', educating local youths recruited through the '''Mayor's Summer Youth Program''' with information about healthy food as well as valuable work skills. There's also a farm stand onsite where the fruits of the land are sold."
"The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse has perhaps the most unusual history of any of Buffalo's the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright buildings. Designed in 1905 (contemporaneously with the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright's most famous Buffalo's commissions, the lost '''Larkin Administration Building''' and the very-much-alive '''Darwin D. Martin House'''), The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse was intended to be built for the University of Wisconsin Boat Club in Madison, but was instead built in Buffalo's — in 2007, over a century after the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright's design was finalized — and only thanks to the dogged efforts of a local group of the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright aficionados financed largely by Buffalo-born screenwriter Tom Fontana. The only alteration to the original design was the replacement of the stucco on the exterior walls with concrete. The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse does double duty today as both the working boathouse of the '''West Side Rowing Club''' and a destination for the growing legion of architectural tourists who come to Buffalo's to see the works of the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright and other greats. The only boathouse ever designed by the eminent Frank Lloyd Wright, the Charles and Marie Fontana Boathouse's also available to rent for private events."
"Held annually in early April, the Buffalo Small Press Book Fair sees authors, artists, poets, booksellers, bookmakers, and book enthusiasts descend on Karpeles Manuscript Library's '''Porter Hall''' to break bread, exchange ideas, and interact with fans and aspiring authors. Books, zines, artwork, and other materials can be bought and sold, and lectures, symposia, poetry readings, and other cultural performances are also put on. Attendance is free of charge and open to the public."
"Every year since 1997 on the third Saturday in June, the Discover Amherst Street Festival has shined a limelight on the newly revitalized neighborhood of Grant-Amherst. A huge variety of activities, events and sales are put on by neighborhood businesses all day, culminating with a parade that begins at noon at the Discover Amherst Street Festival's ground zero, the historic Flemish Renaissance-style '''Ladder #12 Firehouse'''. Worthy of special mention is the '''464 Gallery''', whose daylong art fair and sale is a key feature of the Discover Amherst Street Festival every year, as well as the annual weiner-eating contest at '''Spar's European Sausages'''. Trolley rides and horse-drawn buggies traverse Amherst Street all afternoon, and live music is performed at various places around the newly revitalized neighborhood of Grant-Amherst."
"The Taste of Diversity has been held on Grant Street every summer since 2003 on varying dates, and has become the most popular street festival on the West Side, with almost 2,000 attendees gathering on the block between Lafayette and Auburn Avenues in the heart of the strip. As might be inferred from The Taste of Diversity's title, what's celebrated at The Taste of Diversity are the delicious and vibrant cuisines of each of the West Side's vibrant ethnic communities. But don't mistake this for a clone of downtown's '''Taste of Buffalo''': rather than the West Side's hoity-toitiest restaurants duking The Taste of Diversity out for prize money and publicity, The Taste of Diversity takes a decidedly more grassroots approach, where the food is prepared by smaller, more humble (but, it should be emphasized, equally delicious and arguably more authentic) neighborhood restaurants and food trucks, and where the goal is to celebrate the beauty of the West Side's diversity — and perhaps more importantly, the fact that a united, cohesive community with an increasingly high quality of life has been forged out of smaller, more humble (but, it should be emphasized, equally delicious and arguably more authentic) neighborhood restaurants and food trucks. Festivities at The Taste of Diversity also comprise traditional music, dancing, and other events representing the full spectrum of the West Side's cultural rainbow."
"Shared between Buffalo and neighboring Fort Erie, Ontario, the Friendship Festival is a weeklong celebration of almost 200 years of friendship and mutual cooperation between the United States and Canada, and coincides with both Independence Day in the United States (July 4th) and Canada Day (July 1st). Beginning in late June, festivities are held on both sides of the Niagara River, notably Riverside Park in Buffalo and Mather Arch Park in neighboring Fort Erie, Ontario. On both sides of the Niagara River, parades, classic car shows, War of 1812 reenactments (at neighboring Fort Erie, Ontario), live music, and fireworks are enjoyed."
"Buffalo has a vibrant multiethnic heritage dating back almost to the time Buffalo was founded, and almost inarguably the most dominant culture was the Germans: in the late 19th Century, the Germans made up more than half of Buffalo's population, and even today, fully 14% of Western New Yorkers claim German ancestry. Why, then, does Buffalo not have a huge German festival to match Buffalo's '''Italian Festival''', '''St. Patrick's Day Parade''', '''Dyngus Day''', ad nauseam? That was the question posed by the inimitable ""Airborne"" Eddy Dobosiewicz, founder of the festival which was celebrated for the first time in 2013 and aims to take a place alongside those other annual Buffalo traditions. Scaled down quite a bit from the massive, multi-venue blowouts of years past, beginning in 2016 it's the {{marker|type=listing|name=Polish Cadets|lat=42.937838|long=-78.889268}} hall on Grant Street, ironically enough, that plays host to River Rocktoberfest. Live oompah music, authentic German food and beer, and Teutonic merrymaking of all kinds await you in late September."
"'''Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper''', the community organization whose mission is to contribute to Buffalo's revitalization through the remediation of local waterways, holds a series of educational kayak tours in Buffalo's, Niagara Falls, and points between. The lineup of tours changes from year to year, but as an example, on the West Side the 2014 schedule included the annual '''Scajaquada Creek Regatta''', a ""leisurely paddle down the Black Rock Canal and up historic Scajaquada Creek, an underutilized resource full of history and ecology"" that launched at the {{marker|type=listing|name=Great Lakes Center|lat=42.899095|long=-78.901841}} off Porter Avenue.

"Described in the ''UB Spectrum'' as an ""unpretentious diamond in the rough"", the American Repertory Theatre moved to the American Repertory Theatre's current location in Grant-Amherst in 2015 from the American Repertory Theatre's former home in the Delaware District with the help of Dwane Hall, the owner of the '''Sportsmen's Tavern''' next door, creating in the process a grassroots-based performing arts alliance that's bolstered the already sizzling Amherst Street cultural scene. the American Repertory Theatre's new home is an intimate ""black box""-style playhouse with fifty seats and a production schedule that regularly includes not only a mix of classic and contemporary theatrical works, but also live music, film screenings, poetry readings, and a variety of community events."
"The Kavinoky Theatre is located in Prospect Hill on the campus of '''D'Youville College'''. Over the course of The Kavinoky Theatre's history, not only has The Kavinoky Theatre thoroughly restored the historic former '''Porter-View Room''' under the auspices of the D'Youville Capital Campaign, but The Kavinoky Theatre has produced nearly 150 plays and musicals of a consistently high quality, earning The Kavinoky Theatre more awards than any other troupe in Buffalo. The Kavinoky Theatre has given many actors of local extraction many actors of local extraction's start in The Kavinoky Theatre."
"Buffalo's premier alternative theatre, the New Phoenix Theatre on the Park opened in 1996 in a historic house in the West Village and has quickly gained an impressive reputation for the high-quality, diverse range of performances Buffalo's premier alternative theatre, the New Phoenix Theatre on the Park has hosted in Buffalo's premier alternative theatre, the New Phoenix Theatre on the Park's tiny space, trending heavily towards bold contemporary works of theatre as well as avant-garde reinterpretations of old favorites.

"Grant-Ferry's live performance venue of choice. From indie rock bands and acoustic troubadours, to DJs spinning cutting-edge electronica, to big-band jazz, to such exotica as drum circles, belly-dancing and poetry slams, there's really no rhyme or reason to the array of local acts that take the stage at the Gypsy Parlor. Open-mic night is held every Tuesday at 8PM."
"Designed by the internationally-famous father-and-son team of Eliel and Eero Saarinen, Kleinhans Music Hall is among the most architecturally distinguished buildings in Buffalo (Kleinhans Music Hall has served as a model for Festival Hall in London, among other venues), and boasts world-renowned acoustics. Aside from the several-times-weekly performances of the Buffalo Philharmonic the Buffalo Philharmonic itself, Kleinhans Music Hall also features performances by other orchestras, small theatrical shows, and popular music acts — which have included Natalie Merchant, Johnny Mathis, and the Indigo Girls — performing either on their own or backed by the Buffalo Philharmonic itself as part of the '''BPO Rocks!''' concert series."
"On the first Saturday of each month, this hip yet unpretentious neighborhood watering hole at the heart of Grant-Amherst is transformed into the site of the '''Black Rock Fiddle Jam''', where local musicians get together for a rousing round of old-time acoustic music — an informal, freeform hoedown of fiddles, mandolins, banjos, guitars and good times. For those who would rather try those who would rather try their hand at playing instead of just watching and listening's hand at playing instead of just watching and listening, lessons for all skill levels are provided free of charge."
"It was scarcely possible to be a rock fan in Buffalo in the '90s and early '00s without having an intimate familiarity with the old Showplace — the old Showplace was a linchpin of the local scene, with a list as long as your arm of punk, alternative and indie bands that graced the stage of the old Showplace just before they reached superstar status (including, off the top of this author's head: Pearl Jam, the Goo Goo Dolls, Finger Eleven, and the Tragically Hip). the old Showplace finally shut the old Showplace's doors in 2007, but after a six-year hiatus, local entrepreneur Joe Roxbury bought the old Showplace, renovated the old Showplace from top to bottom, and reopened the old Showplace in 2016 with a full slate of concerts, comedy shows, and the like in the offing."
"Though there are very few sportsmen to be found here, the Sportsmen's Tavern has emerged over the past few years as a real standout: with an authentically gritty roadhouse vibe, the self-described ""honkiest, tonkiest beer joint in town"" is among town's premier places to see live local country, folk, blues, and roots-rock acts. the Sportsmen's Tavern's is a venue by musicians and for musicians — the Sportsmen's Tavern's owner is a longtime stalwart in the town scene, and many local artists and bands cite the Sportsmen's Tavern as many local artists and bands's favorite place to play in town. The 325 seats are regularly filled with an eclectic mix of hipsters, college students, and neighborhood regulars who probably remember the days when the Sportsmen's Tavern was just a garden-variety neighborhood gin mill. And the '''Grille at the Sportsmen's Tavern''' goes above and beyond the usual pub grub, serving probably the best food of any live-music venue in town. For a truly unique experience, try to get seats in the upstairs balcony."
"Sugar City is back: after ballooning rents priced Sugar City out of Sugar City's former headquarters in Allentown (now the home of '''PAUSA Art House'''), Sugar City reemerged in August 2014 in a new spot on what the ''Buffalo News'' has termed the ""suddenly sexy 1200 block of Niagara Street"", which is also home to the '''Body of Trade & Commerce Gallery''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. The performance space in the rear of Sugar City seats audiences of up to 170 — quite a bit bigger than the stage at their old digs — and plays host to a variety of local bands that run the indie gamut from hardcore punk to ambient noise to neo-garage rock. Theatrical productions, poetry readings, and other performances take place as well. As before, all shows at Sugar City are all ages and alcohol-free."
"This neighborhood laundromat-cum-cultural nucleus boasts '''WASH the Mic!''', a bimonthly open-mic event where local musicians come to jam, as well as a monthly curated concert series that's a showcase for the local ambient, drone, and experimental noise scenes."
"Ground zero for the Upper West Side's retail scene, the West Side Bazaar is one of the main ''raisons d'être'' of the emergence of Buffalo's new internationally-flavored commercial district. the West Side Bazaar has served not only as a business incubator helping newly landed immigrants on newly landed immigrants's feet and on newly landed immigrants's way to successful entrepreneurship, but also as an important gathering place for new residents eager for a friendly reminder of new residents eager for a friendly reminder of their native lands's native lands. A project of the '''Westminster Economic Development Initiative''', the West Side Bazaar was founded in 2009 and two years later expanded into a full-fledged market, inspired by the '''Malcolm Shabazz Market''' in Harlem and in keeping with the tradition of large public markets like the East Side's '''Broadway Market''' which could at one time be found all over Buffalo's. the West Side Bazaar moved to a larger location in April 2013, and today contains a large and growing lineup of stalls selling a maddeningly diverse array of ethnic fashions and crafts, as well as an '''International Kitchen''' with immigrant-owned restaurants serving authentic international cuisines (see below)."
"At one of the West Side Bazaar's newest stalls, shopkeeper Maung Moe serves Buffalo's Karen immigrant community with an impressive selection of clothing spanning both traditional and Western styles. A wide range of winter gear is also offered, along with more modest selections of other accessories, jewelry, shoes, and cosmetics."
"Owner Gysma Kueny moved to Buffalo in 2002 from war-torn South Sudan, and now operates Owner Gysma Kueny's eponymous shop at the West Side Bazaar where a wide range of ethnic clothing, cultural gifts, and specialty bath products are for sale. Available here are fashion accessories such as artisan jewelry, handbags, a modest range of clothing, and even scarves and gloves, along with shea butter and various natural soaps including black soap imported from Ghana. Craft items are handmade by African artisans and include baskets, works of art, and (especially) wooden figurines representing giraffes, tigers, elephants, lions, water buffalo, and other African fauna. Best of all, the money you spend here could scarcely go to a better cause: Owner Gysma Kueny uses part of Owner Gysma Kueny's profits to fund a charitable initiative to promote education for South Sudanese girls."
"Julienne Nyiranjishi's whole family are artisans — both those in Buffalo and back home in Rwanda — and it's Julienne Nyiranjishi's whole family's work that's for sale at Julienne's Boutique. Clothing, jewelry and accessories, traditional baskets, and postcards bedecked with beautiful African imagery are on offer, but the specialty here is handmade wooden carvings: from traditional bowls to statuettes to tableware."
"One of the West Side Bazaar's newest vendors, Myanmar native Khatiza Bodialam opened up shop in January 2014 at the stall formerly belonging to the sadly missed '''Anokha Leewu'''. Injecting still more color into an already vibrant environment, the cornerstone of Khatiza Gift Shop's inventory is traditional Burmese dresses in bright, cheery patterns, as well as handmade silk flowers in a multiplicity of varieties. Additionally, scarves, jewelry and other accessories are on offer, as well as a modest selection of fragrances."
"Nadeen Yousef, the owner and namesake of this little West Side Bazaar stall, is a native of Iraq who spent six years as a refugee in Syria before the onset of civil war there drove Yousef to Buffalo in 2009. Macramé is rather popular in the Levant; less so in the United States, and back home Yousef had already begun making a name for Yousef with Yousef's skill in the craft, so it was only natural that Yousef would turn to Macramé as a way to make Yousef living in Yousef's adopted country. At Macramé by Yousef Yousef offers a small but charming (and growing!) range of handmade macramé goods including wall art, jewelry, and plant hangers, as well as custom goods made to order."
"The rear wall of the West Side Bazaar is given over to Ma Theint's sprawling collection of ethnic clothing, home decor, and (above all) artworks and Burmese handicrafts. Customers can peruse traditional tapestries, Buddhist religious items, drums and musical instruments, tapestries, lacquerware, dolls and puppets, and scads of other items that serve Ma Theint's's mission of promoting appreciation of Burmese culture and the immigrant community in Buffalo."
"As advertised, the wares in Madhavi Pyakurel's new West Side Bazaar stall comprise traditional Nepali clothing, accessories, and cosmetics. ""Fashion has no boundaries"", says Madhavi Pyakurel's new West Side Bazaar stall's motto, and it rings true — customers of all stripes come here to browse through or purchase at reasonable prices an ample gamut of truly elegant dresses and saris, lovely bead jewelry, comfy shoes, makeup and bath products."
"The African Market opened at the north end of Grant-Ferry in 2009; despite The African Market's name, the variety of imported foods offered here spans not only Africa, but the whole world. Though canned goods, spices, rice and other staples, and other miscellaneous groceries are sole here, the marquee item at The African Market is a wide variety of meats, many of which are halal or kosher — from everyday selections like beef and chicken to more unusual ones such as goat. A small selection of kitchenwares and ethnic clothing rounds out the marquee item at the African Market. Best of all, unlike most small Grant-Ferry businesses, The African Market boasts off-street parking: there's a small lot on the left side of the building, which is also where the main entrance is found."
"After a hot minute brweing up Buffalo's first craft kombucha brewery's homemade goodness in the basement of '''Horsefeathers Market''', Buffalo's first craft kombucha brewery moved on up in August 2016 to a bigger location on burgeoning Niagara Street, right next door to '''Resurgence Brewery'''. Kombucha is a lightly carbonated, fermented tea (Bootleg Bucha uses a mix of green and black teas) native to East Asia that has a wide array of purported health benefits; the super friendly and enthusiastic owners — Jeff Empric, Heather Lucas, and Todd Salansky, a trio of longtime friends who got their start homebrewing in their apartment and giving Kombucha away to family and friends — will be more than happy to run those down with you, or answer any other questions you may have. With a bigger location on burgeoning Niagara Street, right next door to '''Resurgence Brewery''' has come a hugely expanded range of selections on offer — there are about four dozen different kombuchas now in the rotation of what's on tap at the store, including the ginger beer, carrot pineapple, and blueberry lavender that were so popular at the old '''Horsefeathers Market''' location. You can buy the ginger beer, carrot pineapple, and blueberry lavender that were so popular at the old Horsefeathers location in disposable plastic bottles if you like, but Bootleg Bucha will also sell you a more environmentally friendly reusable glass bottle for $2, or you can even bring your own growler to fill."
"Since 2012, this farm has been run on ten vacant lots on the Upper West Side by Matt Kauffman, as a ministry program of the nearby '''Buffalo Vineyard Church'''. The mission here is to promote sustainable gardening as a way of providing neighborhood residents not only with fresh produce, but also vital education regarding healthy dietary choices. The food grown at this farm is disseminated mostly to local residents who've signed up for food shares through the '''Community-Supported Agriculture''' program, as well as to local restaurants, schools and food banks — but seasonal produce is also available at their farm stand at the corner of West Delavan and West Avenues, open on Saturdays in season."
"Like the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', this longstanding butcher shop (opened in 1963 by the now-retired Frank and Maria Zarcone is a throwback to the West Side's former identity as Buffalo's Italian neighborhood. Though many of the similar businesses that lined the West Side's's streets have fallen by the wayside in the ensuing years, the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', this longstanding butcher shop (opened in 1963 by the now-retired Frank and Maria Zarcone's stuck around long enough to benefit from Grant-Ferry's revival as Buffalo's's newest hip shopping district, with more and more new customers every day enjoying the fine quality meats available here at decent prices. The specialty at the larger '''Guercio & Sons''', this longstanding butcher shop (opened in 1963 by the now-retired Frank and Maria Zarcone's is homemade Italian sausage and meatballs — among the best in Buffalo's — but other meats (Italian and otherwise) are available here too, such as Delmonico steaks, stuffed pork chops, and a few seafood items. Limited off-street parking is available."
"Golden Burma serves the growing community of immigrants and refugees from that country that have settled on Buffalo's West Side with a wide range of Burmese groceries, including fresh seafood, meat and vegetables, as well as canned, packaged, and frozen foods. For fans of Southeast Asian cuisine, the perpetually crowded aisles of Golden Burma are an excellent place to find exotic and unusual products and ingredients that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo's. Pots, pans, woks, and miscellaneous kitchenware are also on offer."
"With over 50 years of tradition, Guercio & Sons dates back to 1961. That's when Vincent and Nancy Guercio, immigrants to Buffalo from Cefalù, Sicily, purchased the erstwhile '''Grant Street Market''' and set out converting the erstwhile '''Grant Street Market''' into a gargantuan grocery store stocking all manner of meats, cheeses, produce, oils, and other foodstuffs imported from Italy. Guercio & Sons persevered through the demographic changes on the Upper West Side — which saw successive waves of immigrants from wholly different parts of the world pass through the neighborhood — and the rise of the suburban supermarket by expanding into wholesaling, furnishing ingredients for such well-known Buffalo restaurants as '''Left Bank''', '''Hutch's''', and the '''Buffalo Chophouse'''. Now owned by Vincent and Nancy Guercio, Guercio & Sons is once again thriving — Guercio & Sons's is one of Buffalo's prime destinations for Italian foods, both imports and locally produced items such as sliced bread from '''Luigi's Bakery''' and '''Anchor Bar''' brand wing sauce. When Guercio & Sons're done marveling at the lovely carts on the sidewalk brimming with delicious, brightly colored fruits, vegetables, and herbs, visitors to Guercio & Sons's can enter the building the building itself and stroll through the fragrant corridors stocked with everything you could ever want from an Italian grocery store — canned goods, imported pasta, sliced-to-order deli meats like mortadella and soppressata, a dizzying array of fine olive oils, and more. Quite simply, Guercio & Sons is not to be missed."
"Mirroring the neighborhood in which this friendly food market's located, diversity is the name of the game at this friendly food market. this friendly food market's helpful staff, helmed by Somali-born UB nursing student Ali Mohamed, serves nearly all of the West Side's varied communities of immigrants with a maddeningly eclectic variety of groceries from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Arab world. Meats from beef and chicken to lamb and goat, many of Meats from beef and chicken to lamb and goat, many of them certified halal certified halal, are joined on the shelves by seafood, canned goods, rice, spices, and various and sundry food items. this friendly food market's owners also run '''Shawarma King''', a takeout window a few blocks south where delicious and inexpensive Middle Eastern and African foods are available."
"Founded in 2010 under the name '''Marka Halal Market''', Jomow International Market's is yet another West Side destination for imported African and Arabian food. A variety of general groceries are stocked, but Jomow International Market's true claim to fame is Jomow International Market's's wide selection of halal meats, from beef and fish to goat and camel."
"Founded in 2014, the name of the game at this ethnic grocery at the north end of the Grant-Ferry strip is African and Middle Eastern specialty foods: from staples like rice and ''fufu'' flour, to frozen foods, to a wide selection of fresh produce, meats and fish. A range of toiletry products and other daily essentials are also on offer."
"Opened in 2010, Lin Asian Market is a pioneer when it comes to serving the culinary needs of the West Side's burgeoning community of Burmese immigrants and refugees. Lin Asian Market's small size and spartan interior belie an impressive variety of Burmese and other Southeast Asian grocery items."
"The cheeky puns are seemingly neverending: Lorigo's ""Meating Place"", so the slogan goes, is ""Your Link to Quality"". Indeed, homemade, family-recipe Italian sausage and meatballs are the specialty at the meat market that Lorigo's founded on the East Side and moved to Grant Street in 1986. Lorigo's's began life as a real, old-fashioned butcher shop of the type that are becoming less and less common these days, and the skilled professionals behind the counter still pride the skilled professionals behind the counter in cutting the chicken, pork, veal, and other meats sold here to customers' specifications. However, as time went on, Lorigo's's expanded into wholesaling and also converted Lorigo's into a grocery market that, in a nod to the current melting-pot identity of the neighborhood, sells a wide variety of ethnic foods from Latino (including a full line of Goya products) to Caribbean to Somali to Southeast Asian. The aisles are jumbled and hard to navigate and the place gets crowded at peak hours, but there are some really high-quality products to be found here. Check out Lorigo's's great selection of delicious and reasonably-priced frozen desserts, too."
"At first blush, you'd be forgiven for being a bit confused by the Produce Market. ""Meats, vegetables and groceries"" are advertised proudly on the sign at the front of the Produce Market, but there's no meat, and the selection of produce is quite underwhelming especially given the name of the place. To be fair, though, the two or three forlorn-looking boxes of veggies just inside the door don't constitute the two or three forlorn-looking boxes of veggies just inside the door's entire produce section — the real good stuff is in back, with lots of garlic, citrus fruits, and various and sundry Asian produce to choose from. But it's the final element of the trio on the sign where the Produce Market really shines. The bulk of the Produce Market's inventory is given over to a respectable variety of South and Southeast Asian packaged groceries and canned goods: huge sacks of rice are stacked in the front windows for passersby to admire, boxes of ''chana dal'' and other dried beans and legumes line the aisles, and spices are sold in bulk for shockingly low prices. A range of cooking oil, Indian pickles and chutneys, and frozen foods round out the selection here. the Produce Market is open daily and keeps long hours, and the friendly staff is eager to help folks find what folks need."
"Located across the street from corporate headquarters on Niagara Street, Rich's Red Brick Market is exactly what the name advertises — a charming 19th-century brick storefront that is the retail outlet for Rich's. Rich's Red Brick Market is one of the only places in the world where Rich's's products, which are normally distributed wholesale to restaurants and other institutions, are offered for sale to the public directly — and at sharply discounted prices to boot. The ""café"" portion of Rich's Red Brick Market's name, meanwhile, is indeed a misnomer; Rich's Red Brick Market has only a small retail counter and one table, with much of the interior space given over to massive rows of freezers and coolers. Baked goods are prominent among the offerings in massive rows of freezers and coolers, with ready-to-bake bread, cookie and pastry dough on offer, as well as a full range of pasta products, meat and seafood items including delicious barbeque pork, and, of course, the famous '''Coffee Rich''' non-dairy creamer that put Rich's on the map in the first place. Onsite as well is '''Dessert Builders''', which fills custom dessert orders on an advance-notice basis. Rich's Red Brick Market also holds frequent ""Truck Load Sales"" where goods are sold in bulk for discounts even steeper than normal. Visitors who are daunted by the heavy, fast-moving traffic on Niagara Street will be glad to know that ample off-street parking is provided."
"Buffalo's population includes over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan, but for a long time, there was no place in Buffalo's for over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan to buy the foods over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan had enjoyed in over a thousand immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan's native lands. That all changed with the opening of Sagarmatha Grocery, whose owner Kaji Sunwar is a Nepalese expat who, with a little help from Buffalo's's '''Rich Products Corporation''' and Canisius College's '''Students In Free Enterprise''', cut the ribbon to this friendly little shop in 2012. this friendly little shop can be found a full range of fresh produce, canned and packaged goods, and spices to serve the palettes of Buffalo's's Nepalese and Bhutanese immigrant communities, as well as other aficionados of Buffalo's Nepalese and Bhutanese immigrant communities. As well, fresh goat, chicken, fish and beef are sold Wed-Sun, and a small selection of brightly-colored ethnic clothing items is also stocked. Sagarmatha doesn't neglect the rest of the multicultural West Side tapestry, either, stocking groceries and sundry items of interest to the Burmese, African, and Latino contingents as well, including an impressive range of Goya products for the latter."
"Another location of the same operation that runs '''United Grocery and Halal Meats''' on the Lower West Side, this place bills this place as a specialty food shop selling ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, Somalian, African, Spanish, and American food and spices"". That's a bit of an exaggeration, though — the offerings at this place consist of a selection of ethnic packaged foods (largely from South and East Asia) that's really nothing special by Grant Street standards, as well as standard simple American groceries you'd find at any corner bodega and non-edible daily needs such as toothpaste, over-the-counter drugs, and even toys, bedding, clothes and gifts. One strong point this place does boast is a large frozen food section containing some interesting exotic goodies."
"Opened in 2012 at the corner of Hampshire and West Ferry Streets, City Swagg offers the best in urban fashions straight from the streets of New York, L.A. and Miami. From everyday wear like jeans, dresses, and jackets, to shoes and accessories, to swimwear and body suits, the designs here are sexy, sassy and make a bold statement. As well as clothing, City Swagg also sells mobile phones and related accessories, with calling plans from providers such as H2O Wireless, T-Mobile, and Net10."
"High-fashion clothing with an urban flair is the stock in trade of Empire Kicks. Empire Kicks, Empire Kicks is located in a small plaza just off Grant Street. Empire Kicks is the place to go on the West Side for a wide range of authentic designer t-shirts, hoodies, jeans, and athletic shoes. Sports fans can choose from among the wide array of baseball caps and swag here, with all Sports fans's favorite team logos on it. Empire Kicks also offers layaway."
"Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below), further expanded Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below)'s West Side retail empire in 2013 with Global Chic, which complements the gifts, crafts and accessories offered in Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below)'s original store with a full line of unique, vibrant fashions. Much like Louise Sano, the owner of '''Global Villages''' (see below)'s other venture, Global Chic, which complements the gifts, crafts and accessories offered in her original store with a full line of unique, vibrant fashions's multiethnic offerings boast a diversity that mirrors the multinational identity of Grant-Ferry Grant-Ferry itself; however, here the diverse styles are not merely placed side by side on the shelves and racks, but are more often combined within each piece into a delectable multicultural fusion that truly adds up to more than the sum of Global Chic, which complements the gifts, crafts and accessories offered in her original store with a full line of unique, vibrant fashions's parts. Custom alterations are also available."
"Hailing from Rwanda, Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano, cut Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano's teeth as a founding member of the '''West Side Bazaar''' in 2011 before moving up the street the following year to inaugurate Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano's own store, which has been described as a locally-based iteration of '''Ten Thousand Villages'''. At Global Villages', Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano sells a range of unique jewelry, accessories, soaps and bath items, and gifts that's been personally and expertly selected by Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano. The fashions here represent a diverse range of ethnic styles — from Kenya to Myanmar to India — and the authentic craft items for sale here encompass drums, baskets, objets d'art, decorative items, and more. A small range of literature, primarily on African topics, is also offered. Best of all, Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano prides Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano on Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano's extensive familiarity with Global Villages' dynamo owner, Louise Sano's suppliers and her suppliers's work, whether it be a traditional artisan in Thailand, a local crafter on the West Side, or Sano herself, who designs much of the jewelry stocked here. To top it all off, Global Villages''s interior is brimming with character — the tin ceilings and original hardwood floors and transom windows are a remarkable preservation of Global Villages''s history."
"San-Bor Sports has been described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as an ""urban sports shop that has withstood the tests of time, and for that San-Bor Sports are all lucky"". It's true. Owner Rick Bordieri has proven Owner Rick Bordieri nothing if not adaptable, meeting the needs of West Side residents for over forty years even as the profile of the average West Side resident has changed and changed again. At San-Bor Sports a range of sporting goods is indeed sold, but the focus is more on sportswear, with a wide gamut of athletic shoes (including Converse and Air Jordans), baseball caps, custom sports jerseys, jeans, and other casual urban streetwear filling the shelves. In season, a range of bubble jackets, boots, and other cold-weather gear can be had to see customers through the bleak Buffalo winters. San-Bor Sports's selection is impressive: there are some pretty hard-to-find items here, including a full line of t-shirts from '''Stacks and Kicks''', a boutique label headquartered right in Buffalo. San-Bor's selection is curated by a knowledgeable staff that is thoroughly familiar with the products San-Bor Sports sell, and service comes with genuine friendliness and appreciation every time."
"In March 2015, Rust Belt Books emerged from hibernation at a new location on Grant Street after leaving Rust Belt Books's previous home in Allentown. However, aside from the location little has changed: Rust Belt Books is still one of the best, and best-loved, used bookstores in Buffalo or anywhere else. An exhaustive selection of reading material of every genre — from old cookbooks to '70s music journalism to esoteric feminist essays to the classics of literature — is available there for the book lover, with an enthusiastic and helpful staff and colorful clientele. More than that, Rust Belt Books's relentless devotion to the local community sees Rust Belt Books playing host to a variety of community events, as well as poetry readings, plays and other special events."
"West Side Stores is a true gem — a friendly, cozy independent bookstore, well-kept yet unpretentious, that stocks a wide-ranging selection of over 12,000 gently used books ranging from biography to mystery to kids' books to sci-fi to the classics of literature, at prices that never exceed $10. Better still, West Side Stores is at the forefront of West Side Stores businesses (no mean feat) when it comes to dedication to West Side businesses (no mean feat)'s neighborhood — West Side businesses (no mean feat) host community events on a frequent basis, donate free books to various worthy causes, and have a policy of one free book per visit offered to all children who stop in. Though West Side Stores is probably not the place to go if you've got a specific title in mind, West Side Stores's selection is nevertheless fascinating — all the more so given that everything West Side Stores sell is acquired through donation (West Side Stores'll pay you a price that's hard to beat for your gently used books!) A children's play area is available for parents who want some time to parents who want some time to themselves while strolling the aisles while strolling the aisles, and the friendly couple that owns West Side Stores is always around for a friendly chat with customers, or to put the friendly couple that owns the place's encyclopedic knowledge of the friendly couple that owns the place's inventory to use in helping the friendly couple that owns the place find what the friendly couple that owns the place're looking for. West Side Stores also does a brisk side business selling used records ($3.50 each)."
"'''New World Record''' and '''Home of the Hits''' closed in the 2000s and '''Record Theatre''' is down to two struggling locations, but that hasn't dissuaded Black Dots' owner and sole employee, Joshua Smith, a former punk rocker and prolific record collector and trader native to Syracuse, from daring to buck the trend: Black Dots' owner and sole employee, Joshua Smith, a former punk rocker and prolific record collector and trader native to Syracuse's place is one of Buffalo's newest independent record stores, whose opening in June 2013 in the basement of a Lafayette Avenue flat was so audacious in the face of steeply declining sales of tangible music that the ''Buffalo News'' devoted a lengthy article to it. Black Dots' is named for the groundbreaking 1979 debut by D.C. punkers Bad Brains, and aptly so: Black Dots' deals exclusively in new and used punk, hardcore, and indie releases on vinyl and cassette, to the exclusion of CDs, as well as a selection of stickers, patches and band t-shirts. Vinyl aficionados, devotees of underground music, and those who are curious about the local scene will be in heaven at Black Dots' perusing the crates of rare releases by little-known bands in the well-worn interior; even the hand-scrawled sign, reminiscent of an old-school concert flyer, screams ""punk rock""."
"Since 2006, Luis Rodriguez has operated this small Grant Street record shop where the accent is on rap, R&B, reggae, soca, and Latin sounds, as well as racks of streetwear styled to match the hip-hop bent of the music. If you're interested in the local hip-hop scene, look no further: this small Grant Street record shop where the accent is on rap, R&B, reggae, soca, and Latin sounds stocks a wide selection of the latest releases by local rappers at prices that can't be beat."
"With a motto of ""Embeer Buffalo"", Community Beer Works is the city's first nanobrewery, proudly producing craft beer that's delicious and award-winning in quality: some of the accolades Community Beer Works has earned include being named ""Best New Brewery in New York State"" for 2013 by ratebeer.com, as well as a second-place finish for Community Beer Works's India Pale Ale in ''Brewing News'' magazine's 2013 National IPA Championships. Indeed, pale ales of various descriptions are the star products at Community Beer Works: Community Beer Works's most popular brew, an American Pale Ale called ""Frank"", can be found on tap at well-known local spots like '''Allen Street Hardware''', '''Pano's''', and the '''Village Beer Merchant'''. Community Beer Works also have a retail store open three days a week where beer aficionados can come and fill beer aficionados's bottles and kegs — 32-ounce (946 ml) growlers for $7, 64-ounce (1,893 ml) growlers for $12, and kegs for $90 — or buy branded merchandise such as T-shirts, glasses and growlers. Best of all, Community Beer Works's commitment to the well-being of the the city's area is legendary: spent grain from Community Beer Works is donated to the '''Massachusetts Avenue Project''' to be reused as fertilizer, and community pride and a sense of place are fostered in many other ways as well."
"Frontier Liquors opened in 1974, long before Grant Street had the cachet Grant Street does today — and as the neighborhood has continued the neighborhood's upswing, Frontier Liquors has really grown into Frontier Liquors's reputation as the place to go for a far-ranging selection of potent potables, including some hard-to-find wines and spirits that other Buffalo liquor stores don't carry. Frontier Liquors is no less impressive in the beer department, with all the usual brands in stock plus a nice range of craft brews from Upstate New York and elsewhere in the region. Ice and salty snacks are also sold to complement the alcohol. Delivery service is available, and, uniquely among liquor stores in the area, Frontier Liquors even offers event planning for those who may be planning a party or get-together. Unfortunately, the ""discount"" portion of Frontier Liquors's name is a bit of a misnomer, but fear not — frequent special deals and promotions are offered."
"This friendly neighborhood variety store proudly offers ""a little bit of everything... not a lot of anything"". a little bit of everything... not a lot of anything will be of particular interest to fans of kitsch; though there's a lot of junk here, buried within a little bit of everything... not a lot of anything are some great finds: quirky clothing, accessories, toys, gifts, and miscellaneous ephemera. Best of all, This friendly neighborhood variety store offers the kind of old-fashioned personal service with a smile that you can't get at Walmart or other big-box retailers."
"Opened in January 2013 in the Hampshire Street storefront formerly occupied by the beloved '''Burma Family Store''', Morning Star sells a little bit of everything. ""100% African"" is the motto that ties together the motley range of merchandise on offer here — from beauty supplies to groceries to a selection of secondhand clothes, DVDs, decorative items and other gifts."
"Newly moved to Grant Street from Sunday's longtime former home in the Elmwood Village, Sunday is the epicenter of Sunday's tight-knit skateboard community. Founder J.P. Gillespie heads up a friendly staff that is passionate about their love of skating, providing helpful service to longtime customers and welcoming into the fold those who may be new to skating. In addition to the first-rate selection of boards on offer there, a selection of clothing and gear is available at Sunday: sneakers (including the latest from such popular brands as Nike, Emerica, and Vans), socks, caps, T-shirts, hoodies, and skating videos. Speaking of which, Sunday is also known for the skate videos Sunday produces and screens locally, featuring such illustrious Sunday talent as Sal Viglietta, Tony Huffnagle, and Jake Donnelly."
"In March 2012, longtime Amherst Street resident Demetrius Williams opened The Jump-Off with a view not only to furthering the growth of Grant-Amherst as a small-business shopping destination, but also of Grant-Amherst's cultural life: longtime Amherst Street resident Demetrius Williams's plans are to eventually hold open-mic events in store for local performers. For now, though, available at The Jump-Off is a respectable range of men's and women's clothing and accessories, united by a stylish yet streetwise urban aesthetic."
"Situated on the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road at the former site of the '''Adriatic Gardens''' restaurant, some of the crowded shelves and racks of this Yemeni-owned outlet are devoted to a respectable selection of colorful and glitzy ladies' fashions, including cute tops, formalwear, jewelry and accessories, and shoes. But above all, this Yemeni-owned outlet is best known for the wide range of menswear this Yemeni-owned outlet carry. From designer jeans and t-shirts, to mens' jewelry and watches, to baseball caps (this Yemeni-owned outlet is a licensed dealer of '''New Era''' caps), to bubble jackets and hoodies, this Yemeni-owned outlet is the place for you if you're looking for urban-styled clothing of pretty much any permutation. The other half of this Yemeni-owned outlet is prepaid mobile phones, with phones and plans on offer from '''Boost Mobile''', '''Virgin Wireless''', and others. The sometimes rude customer service is a sticking point for visitors to this Yemeni-owned outlet, but the selection here is the best in the neighborhood, and the selection here're open late."
"The name of the game at this aptly named Amherst Street store is one-of-a-kind customized T-shirts designed in-house. These guys do first-rate work and infuse These guys's designs with the urban flair that has come to characterize the small but growing fashion scene in this aptly named Amherst Street store. The bulk of this aptly named Amherst Street store's inventory is made up of creative graphic tees, including some with airbrush designs. A range of band tees, other designer clothes, and embroidery rounds out the selection here. this aptly named Amherst Street store's staff has Shirtz' staff's ear to the ground when it comes to the local scene — Shirtz' staff're active and highly sought-out in the production of music videos, commercials, and promotional videos for Buffalo-based businesses and artists — so if you're looking for something unique and characteristically Buffalo, you'd be well-advised to head here."
"Kathleen Arries is to be commended for truth in advertising: there are plenty of tchotchkes to be found in the ample Amherst Street storefront Kathleen Arries's business occupies. The 6,500 square feet (600m²) of retail space here are crammed to the gills with antiques of all descriptions: rare, original and unique examples of housewares, toys, clocks, baskets, and every miscellaneous trinket you could imagine that are the end result of over 100 years of family collecting. This is the kind of place you'd see on ""American Pickers"". Despite the vast variety of stuff to be found here, Chotchky's is at heart a small family business and a labor of love — Kathleen Arries has been the sole employee of ""American Pickers"" since ""American Pickers"" opened in 1998. ""American Pickers"" does a brisk mail-order business as well."
"Coo Coo U's owner, Michael Mensola, has a habit of being a pioneer in every new neighborhood in which Coo Coo U's owner, Michael Mensola sets up shop — Coo Coo U's moved in 2012 to the former '''Jewett Refrigerator Warehouse''' off Military Road after spending the previous quarter-century on Hertel Avenue, and was located in Allentown before the previous quarter-century on Hertel Avenue. Coo Coo U's is the alpha and omega in Buffalo when it comes to Mid-Century and Scandinavian Modern, whether it be furniture, decorative items, works of art, or all manner of other retro curiosities. Aficionados agree that the selection and quality of the items that fill Coo Coo U's is among the best anywhere, even holding the selection and quality of the items that fill this cavernous space's own with the best that places like Toronto and New York City have to offer. To be found here are a myriad of one-of-a-kind items with a fanciful postwar aesthetic — chairs, sofas, coffee tables, lamps and the like are joined by modernist paintings and sculptures, as well as musical instruments, jewelry, and elements of industrial and architectural design. You could easily spend a whole day here. Hours of operation are variable — don't be surprised if the owner opens Coo Coo U's up early or stays late, especially during special sales and promotions or around the holidays."
"Summer 2015 saw another addition to Grant-Amherst's roster of antique and vintage stores arrive at the former home of '''Puchalski's Florist''' — which, like '''Puchalski's Florist''''s new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski, are longtime neighborhood fixtures. its new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski have been steadily growing its new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski's own collection of antiques and vintage collectibles for north of 30 years, and with Junk & Disorderly its new owner-husbands and proud Black Rock native sons David Blake and Mark Bancerowski's bounty is now available to the buying public. And what a bounty their bounty is — there's a ton of merchandise crammed into the former home of '''Puchalski's Florist''', all as kitschy as the name implies. Going beyond the kitsch factor, it's rather difficult to generalize about the constantly changing lineup of merchandise that passes through Junk & Disorderly's doors, but midcentury vintage knickknacks seem to handily outnumber outright antiques (the cutoff date seems to be around World War II) and specialties seem to include lamps, kitchenware, and above all, a treasure trove of decorative Christmas baubles, vintage ornaments, and other holiday-themed items. But the inventory is a diverse hodgepodge — the owners are known to train the owners's eyes on anything unusual or offbeat, and to travel long distances to do so, with merchandise sourced from estate sales, swap meets, and flea markets across the Northeast. Junk & Disorderly's opening hours aren't what you would call extensive, but if you can't make it to Grant Street on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon but happen to be heading eastward after your visit to Buffalo, you might catch the owners at the owners's table at the Ontario Antique Mall in Canandaigua."
"Amherst Street Wine and Liquor is located across the parking lot from '''Wegmans''' supermarket and is owned by the same family — and though eyebrows were raised upon Amherst Street Wine and Liquor's December 2014 opening, which was seen by some as an end-run around the New York state law that prohibits supermarkets from selling liquor, '''Wegmans''''s legions of admirers will probably be pleased with the similarities between the two businesses: aisles and shelves organized more like a supermarket than a typical liquor store, a selection whose size and variety befits a big-box warehouse retailer, and customer service that is second to none in friendliness, helpfulness and knowledge of the two businesses's product. Your Wegmans Shoppers Club Card is even good there. If you're here for wine, you'll find lots of imported vintages as well as domestics from California and the Finger Lakes, but sadly, if you're after a local wine (say, from Niagara County or the Lake Erie Wine Trail), you'll likely leave disappointed. Prices are generally average compared to other liquor stores — the mom-and-pops don't have to worry just yet — but there's always a selection of $6 wines for those on a budget as well as a locked room of rare and high-end wines if you're in the mood to really splurge. Wine tastings are also held on a frequent basis. As for liquors, the bases are covered with all the usual products as well as occasional surprises such as ''metaxa'' (Greek brandy) and other harder-to-find items, again at average prices."
"Since 1995, Michael Gambino has helmed this family-owned and operated liquor store where first-rate value for money is married to the professional, courteous service of the highest order Gambino Liquors provide to Gambino Liquors's loyal customers. Gambino Liquors styles Gambino Liquors as ""Your One-Stop Liquor Shop"", and that's no exaggeration — Gambino Liquors stocks one of Buffalo's widest selections of beer, wine, and (especially) spirits of every description imaginable, as well as mixers, snack foods, and various and sundry other goodies. But what Michael Gambino is perhaps best-known for is Gambino Liquors's affordable prices — nowhere in the area can you get products of such a high quality for more affordable prices. Delivery is available, too."
"Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization dedicated to helping low-income individuals and families find housing, operates two locations of ReStore in Buffalo. The original one is located on Amherst Street. What ReStore in Buffalo amounts to is basically a huge thrift store for furniture and housewares: the shelves are stocked with gently used (and some new!) chairs and tables, sofas, bedroom sets, lamps, cabinetry, doors and windows, building materials, and appliances donated to the shelves by the public. Best of all, ReStore in Buffalo operates with very little overhead — ReStore in Buffalo's staffed by volunteers, so almost all the money you pay goes to help Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization dedicated to helping low-income individuals and families find housing build new homes and rehab old ones to help out the less fortunate. Prices at ReStore in Buffalo are great, but to sweeten the pot a little, ReStore in Buffalo run sales and promotions occasionally, and offer 10% discounts to college students. If you want to give back, donations are accepted at ReStore in Buffalo during business hours, or you can schedule a pickup."
"Spar's European Sausage Shop was founded in 1989 by Eric Spar, a native of Augsburg, Germany, and purchased by Spar's European Sausage Shop's current owner, Spar's's former apprentice Joe Kennedy, in 2005. Spar's European Sausage Shop was recognized as selling the ""Best Sausage in Buffalo"" five years in a row by ''Artvoice'' in ''Artvoice'''s annual ""Best of Buffalo"" poll, and it's not hard to see why: Spar's European Sausage Shop deals in what is easily Buffalo's widest variety of sausages, both fresh and smoked, handcrafted on the premises using only the freshest and finest ingredients. Not surprisingly, German selections such as bratwurst, knockwurst and weisswurst are predominant, but Spar's European Sausage Shop sells literally every kind of sausage you can imagine: Swedish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Polish and Italian sausages, chorizo, andouille, ''merguez'', double-smoked ''kabanosy'', and on and on. And if Spar's European Sausage Shop's doesn't carry your favorite type of sausage, Spar's European Sausage Shop'll custom-prepare your favorite type of sausage for you. Though the sausages are obviously the star of the show, Spar's European Sausage Shop's sells a variety of steaks and chops, cheeses, deli meats including homemade bologna, and specialty groceries that split the difference between imported items and local favorites such as '''Broadway Market''' horseradish, '''Scharf's Schiller Park''' German salad dressing, '''Weber's''' horseradish mustard, and '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas."
"Much like Yasin African Market's counterparts on the other end of Grant Street, Yasin African Market is a destination for those in search of ethnic groceries and halal meats such as fish, lamb, goat and chicken. However, Yasin African Market does Yasin African Market's competition one better by offering an interesting selection of other goods such as handbags and purses, as well as gifts including some surprisingly high-quality carpets."
"Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski were in business on Amherst Street long before Amherst Street became a happening strip on the newly hip West Side: Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski opened up Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski's eponymous Fundalinski Studio in 1982. Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski are certified members of the '''Professional Photographers of America''', and Bogdan is also a multiple-time Kodak Gallery Award winner. their eponymous Fundalinski Studio mostly handles portrait photography, but a brisk secondary business here is selling archival-quality prints of Bogdan and Janice Fundalinski's original work — both Janice Fundalinski's placid nature scenes and Bogdan's colorful, whimsical fantasy images."
"S & M Market looks like just another corner bodega of the type that's so common on the West Side, but a peek inside is sure to surprise the unsuspecting visitor. S & M Market began life in 2009 as a friendly, all-purpose bedding and linen store; indeed, the bread and butter of the inventory here is still a full slate of sheets, comforters, and a wide variety of original blankets (including Disney designs) to fit all bed sizes, as well as mattresses and pillowtops for unbeatable prices. Towels, curtains, rugs, and carpets are on offer as well. However, newly armed with a food store license, S & M Market expanded S & M Market's oeuvre in 2012, and now boasts an intriguing mishmash of wares including high-quality hookah pipes, a variety of halal meats, body oils and perfumes, and more."
"The Serendipity Shoppe is back — after being displaced two years previously by construction at The Serendipity Shoppe's previous home, Elmwood Avenue's '''Lafayette Presbyterian Church''', The Serendipity Shoppe's favorite high-end secondhand store reopened in summer 2014 on burgeoning Amherst Street. The location has changed, but the goods on the shelves remain the same: The Serendipity Shoppe specializes in fine-quality, previously-owned jewelry, artwork, books, furniture, home decor, collectibles, and more (but, interestingly, ''not'' clothing). There's some really unique and offbeat finds here, the kind of stuff you don't generally see at thrift shops, and fans of quirky vintage styles are in luck. Best of all, your money goes to a good cause: The Serendipity Shoppe is run on a not-for-profit basis, with all proceeds benefiting the '''Buffalo AIDS Plus Fund''', which helps residents of the eight-county Western New York area living with HIV and AIDS. Tax-deductible donations are accepted; see website for details."
"The central node of a trio of related shops on the corner of Niagara and Hudson Streets, Kings of da West sells West Siders a variety of new and secondhand urban clothing, shoes, jewelry, and fashion accessories as well as a small variety of cigarettes and smoking supplies. Ladies aren't left out in the cold either: '''Queens of da West''' extends the business into the storefront next door, with ladieswear, purses and other accessories, wigs, and fragrance on offer in similar styles. Lastly, '''Kings Wireless''' is a destination for cell phones and accessories as well as electronics repair."
"Newly moved to Connecticut Street from Positive Approach Press's former home in Allentown, Positive Approach Press works with customers to create custom-designed screen-printed t-shirts, sweatshirts, and even jackets and pants, handcrafted in-house by some of the best designers Western New York has to offer. The folks at Positive Approach Press offer great rates and even better turnaround times (less than seven days in most cases) and will also custom-design business cards, posters, wedding invitations, stationery, and other paper goods."
"After a successful run in the downtown Theater District during the 2015 holiday season as a '''Queen City Pop-Up''' shop, RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard, moved RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard's line of handmade clothing, accessories and custom artwork to the newly renovated '''Club Utica''' building in the heart of Five Points. As newcomers to Buffalo (they originally hail from Shreveport, Louisiana), RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard were conscious from the start that networking with others in the local arts community would make or break RudeBoyz' owners, Qean and Nicola Ballard's business, and on the shelves at RudeBoyz' you can find a wide variety of jewelry, decorative baubles, and others goods produced in limited quantities by local artisans. The dominant presence, though, is Qean's: a street artist by trade, you can find Qean's signature aesthetic — graffiti-inspired designs tempered by superhero and Japanese anime motifs, as well as other influences — all over the place, but especially in the custom artwork Qean creates in the studio in RudeBoyz''s back room. You can even bring in your own clothing and commission Qean to airbrush or screen-print custom designs on your own clothing. RudeBoyz' also serves as a nexus for Buffalo artists with the temporary exhibitions that often grace RudeBoyz''s walls, as well as the music concerts and community functions held there."
"Authentic and gritty with no hint of the supermarket gloss of '''Wegmans''' (or even '''Tops''' on Niagara Street), Á Châu International Market's crowded aisles are stacked floor-to-ceiling with a wide variety of Indian, African, Latin American, and (above all) East Asian specialty groceries. Included in the inventory are delicious and unusual meats, fresh fish, a blockbuster selection of Asian produce such as durian, bok choy, and flaming hot Thai chilies, tea and energy drinks, frozen foods, and in the words of one reviewer, ""every kind of spice, edible sea critter, and sauce you could ever ask for"". If you're on the lookout for that obscure Asian product you saw overseas but haven't been able to find Stateside, this is not a bad place to stop into. Á Châu International Market's's helpful employees — who double as the owners of '''Niagara Seafood''', the Vietnamese restaurant next door — are happy to assist customers in navigating Á Châu International Market's. Á Châu's helpful employees — who double as the owners of '''Niagara Seafood''', the Vietnamese restaurant next door — even sell chopsticks, woks, and other housewares. A word of warning, however: the ""authentic Asian grocery"" part of this blurb is not to be taken lightly, meaning that the squeamish may need to avert the squeamish's gaze from sights like whole frozen bullfrogs in the freezer cases, buckets of freshly eviscerated organ meats, and whole ducks, chickens and rabbits strung up as window displays. There's also a smaller satellite location on the East Side."
"Situated on bustling Connecticut Street a stone's throw from '''Masjid al-Eiman''', Arbin Halal Meat is a new food store that stocks a modest but intriguing selection of halal meat, fresh produce, and dry groceries geared toward Buffalo's growing Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indian population. In addition to what's already been mentioned, Arbin Halal Meat also stocks large sacks of ''channa daal'' and other grains, Indian spices, a small range of Islamic clothing, as well as Western-style snack foods and a surprisingly ample selection of household goods. At Arbin Halal Meat the aisles are cramped and the shelves are not particularly well organized, but the small size of Arbin Halal Meat means that if Arbin Halal Meat carry Arbin Halal Meat, you'll probably find Arbin Halal Meat before too long."
"The hipster-fication of the West Side logged another benchmark in December 2015 with the opening of this specialty shop dedicated to all things pickled and fermented, situated in the heart of the historic West Village a literal stone's throw away from '''Johnson Park'''. Owner R.J. Marvin is a self-styled ""Willy Wonka of pickles"", a 17-year veteran of the local restaurant industry who, while working at the '''Elm Street Bakery''' in East Aurora, hit on the idea of a store that sold unusual varieties of pickles, made in-house from local produce. Flash forward to opening weekend, when Owner R.J. Marvin and Owner R.J. Marvin's wife/partner Lindsey had to abruptly close up shop the day after he and his wife/partner Lindsey's grand opening after completely selling out of all he and his wife/partner Lindsey's stock; the lines had been out the door all day long. Barrel + Brine's selections change frequently — on a given day you'll find creative twists on everyday favorites such as sauerkraut (""classic recipe"" as well as homemade kimchee and red beet and caraway kraut) and pickled cucumbers (both full sours and bread-and-butter varieties; popular favorites include the ""Million Dollar Pickle"" based on an old Amish recipe, the self-explanatory ""Bloody Mary Pickle"", and a ""Southern Tier IPA Pickle"" with fresh hops added to the spice blend), as well as more exotic finds such as fennel-pickled beets, Chinese-style pickled peanuts, ''kkakdugi'' (Korean-style spicy pickled radishes), pickled watermelon rind, and pickled sausage sourced from '''Spar's''' on Amherst Street."
"Buffalo Grocery & Halal Meats is owned by the same people who run '''United Super Bazaar''' on West Ferry Street, and the selection of items is much the same as well — ""Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Burmese, Vietnamese, Nepali, Arabian, African, Spanish, [and] American food and spices"" are proudly touted on the exterior sign. Like Buffalo Grocery & Halal Meats's newer counterpart, though, in reality the selection here isn't as impressive as all that, and skews far more heavily in favor of the Subcontinental and Southeast Asian sides of the equation than the Arabian, African or Latino."
"Along with a range of hair and beauty supplies, braiding, cosmetics, and ethnic clothing, African food is the specialty at this newly established market at the north end of the Niagara Street strip. A modest variety of both fresh and frozen groceries are available for aficionados of the cuisines of West and Central Africa. Also, for anglers who are keen on trying anglers who are keen on trying their luck at nearby '''Broderick Park''' or elsewhere along the West Side riverfront's luck at nearby '''Broderick Park''' or elsewhere along the West Side riverfront, live bait is offered for sale."
"Established in 1950 by West Side native Frank Caruana, The Chocolate Shop is a longstanding neighborhood mainstay that has delighted thousands of Buffalonians over the years. West Side native Frank Caruana learned from the best, cutting West Side native Frank Caruana's teeth at the legendary '''Merkens Chocolate Company''' on Jersey Street before striking out on West Side native Frank Caruana's own, hand-dipping and hand-molding the confections at first before the sheer volume of West Side native Frank Caruana's shop's popularity forced West Side native Frank Caruana to invest in automated machinery. Years later, The Chocolate Shop is still in business custom-molding chocolates to The Chocolate Shop's customers' specifications, whether it be reproducing a sample item or bringing its customers''s zaniest fantasies to life in chocolate form. The bulk of The Chocolate Shop's business is corporate orders and fundraisers, but at The Chocolate Shop's Niagara Street retail location can be found a range of chocolates and candies (including sponge candy, Buffalo's favorite chocolate treat) as well as personalized gift packs made fresh daily with only the finest ingredients."
"In the words of Five Points Bakery's website, Five Points Bakery is all about ""raising the bar on local food"" and ""striv[ing] to overcome the limitations of Five Points Bakery's food system and reclaim our food heritage through education... and a dedication to sustainability"". Sound a bit high-concept and expensive? It is, but visitors who persevere past visitors who persevere past their initial reaction to Five Points' prices's initial reaction to Five Points Bakery's prices soon see that what's sold there is worth splurging for. After a brief hiatus, Five Points Bakery is now reopened in a new location around the corner from the original — a spectacularly restored turn-of-the-century brick block with greatly expanded seating at tables and along the bar. As well, in summer there's additional seating on a rear patio that's one of the most pleasant and distinctive in town: rustic furniture and adobe-colored stucco applied to the walls and foundation of a former outbuilding give it a distinctly Southwestern feel. There's Ethernet ports for laptop jockeys, and both dining room and patio have kids' play areas that are fully stocked with toys, games and books. But the core of the business remains the same: homemade artisanal multigrain, whole-wheat and ciabatta breads made with organically-grown grain from right here in Western New York (specifically, the Zittle Farm in Hamburg), along with delectable pastry — their huge cinnamon rolls are a favorite. Folks especially like the toast bar, where you can choose from various breads to pop in the toaster and top with your choice of honey, peanut butter, and various fruit compotes and cheese spreads. As always, vegans and those with special dietary needs will be delighted that all ingredients are scrupulously labelled."
"The sign on the outside of this bodega, located on the corner of Massachusetts and Plymouth Avenues where '''Mama's Kitchen''' used to be, proudly advertises ""fresh produce, halal meats, and variety groceries"". Sadly, that's an exaggeration (as is this bodega, located on the corner of Massachusetts and Plymouth Avenues where '''Mama's Kitchen''' used to be's name). At Less Price there's no meat at all and only a small freezer full of frozen vegetables, with the inventory mostly given over to general groceries, kitchenwares, toiletries, and snack foods and other corner-store fare. However, they do offer a small selection of Indian and South Asian spices, dried chilies, cooking oil, and ethnic snack foods that might do in a pinch if you've got a hankering for Indian food but are missing a few ingredients."
"Mike's Tropical Market is a popular gathering place for the West Side's burgeoning Latino community, a crowded little corner store jam-packed with specialty groceries including a huge range of Goya products. Mike's Tropical Market is probably the best place in the West Side's for those in search of ingredients for delicious Puerto Rican and Dominican recipes who want a more distinctive experience than what's offered at a supermarket. One-upping other bodegas in the area, Mike's Tropical Market's also boasts a sizable frozen-foods section, a small selection of quality butcher meats and deli items, and fresh tropical (and other) produce. Best of all, Mike's Tropical Market's carries a great selection of specialty coffees at prices that can't be beat."
"Mineo & Sapio is arguably Buffalo's favorite locally-produced brand of sausage — and almost inarguably Buffalo's's best-loved Italian sausage. Mineo & Sapio has built a sterling reputation from Mineo & Sapio's humble beginnings in 1920, founded by John Mineo as a neighborhood meat market on the main drag of the Italian West Side, to a ubiquitous presence in the meat coolers of Western New York supermarkets and on the tables of some of Buffalo's's finest restaurants. In addition to Mineo & Sapio's most famous product (which comes in both links and patties, sweet or spicy), Mineo & Sapio also manufactures chicken sausage, andouille sausage and chorizo, delicious Italian meatballs, meatloaf, and, most recently, several varieties of stuffed hot peppers. Uniting all these products is an unrelenting emphasis on quality — Mineo & Sapio's classic-recipe Italian sausage uses 100% pork with no preservatives or artificial colors, the chicken is a boneless and skinless mix of white and dark meat, and the sausages are packed in all-natural hog casings. Best of all, despite the growth of Mineo & Sapio, Mineo & Sapio's Connecticut Street retail store retains a friendly, intimate atmosphere — impregnated with the delicious aroma of sausage spices, to boot. Frozen sausage of the same type that's sold in grocery stores can be bought there, but since you have the opportunity, you really want to go for the fresh stuff."
"'''Horsefeathers Market''' is the home to the newest entry in Buffalo's growing roster of vegan restaurants and food shops: Nature's Apothecary is where Elena Capozzi, a young entrepreneur and recent graduate of the '''Institute for Integrated Nutrition''', shares Elena Capozzi, a young entrepreneur and recent graduate of the '''Institute for Integrated Nutrition''''s knowledge of and enthusiasm for healthy, holistic eating — not to mention Elena Capozzi, a young entrepreneur and recent graduate of the '''Institute for Integrated Nutrition''''s wonderfully prepared recipes — for hungry folks from across Western New York. The stock in trade here is a mix of yummy baked goods (so delicious that more than one reviewer outright refused to believe they were as healthy as claimed!) as well as raw salads, cold-pressed juices and smoothies, and other prepared foods, all of which are made from organic, sustainably sourced ingredients with no meat, dairy, or corn syrup, and prepared so as to retain as many of the original vitamins and nutrients as possible from the source foods. All items sold at Nature's Apothecary are meticulously labeled with not only a list of ingredients, but a brief description of how each one is beneficial to the body. While most business is to go, there's also limited indoor seating."
"the Niagara Asian Market's not the largest Asian food store on the West Side, but the Niagara Asian Market is a lot bigger than the Niagara Asian Market looks from the outside — and far better-organized than most of the Niagara Asian Market's competition! the Niagara Asian Market stocks mostly Burmese and Thai items and is set up for the maximum convenience of customers who are in search of the essentials of Asian cuisine, with a friendly staff that is eager to assist those who may still need a bit of help finding what those who may still need a bit of help finding what they need need. the Niagara Asian Market is two floors of deliciousness, with fresh Asian produce, frozen meats (including unique items such as frog and eel), and staples such as noodles and rice downstairs, and the upper level given over to packaged groceries and a range of health and beauty items. A drawback is the Niagara Asian Market's exterior signage, which is written almost entirely in Burmese, making the place easily missable from the street."
"After four years spent in the Elmwood Village, the grand reopening of Buffalo's favorite purveyor of ""udderly unique"" cheeses and other gourmet edibles was a gala event at '''Horsefeathers Market''' in August 2016. Nickel City Cheese's new location is much larger, and really done up nice — like the rest of Horsefeathers, Nickel City Cheese's new location's an airy space that mixes 19th-century rustic with 21st-century industrial chic, with exposed brick and wood-panelled everything coexisting with trendy exposed ductwork on the ceiling. But the heart and soul of Nickel City Cheese's new location remains the same: a selection of domestic and imported cheeses that is second to none in the local area, all cut to order, plus a wide variety of artisanal specialty foods such as jams, pickles, coffees, pasta, mustards, vinegars, sauces, and marinades. And if you're looking for a gift, you can't go wrong with Nickel City Cheese's's custom-made gift baskets and cheese-and-charcuterie platters. Best of all, though, with Nickel City Cheese's's expansion into new digs has also come an expansion into a whole new arena of business: owner Jill Gedra Forster also operates a full-service restaurant in the adjacent space, '''Lait Cru Brasserie''', open for breakfast and lunch ''(q.v.)''."
"Phu Thai is a family-operated Asian market that was established in 1994, more than a decade before the West Side retail scene was transformed by a tidal wave of similar ethnic food stores. In stark contrast to the pan-Asian selection at supermarkets like '''Sung's''' and '''Hoowa''' — and even to the pan-Southeast Asian inventory at West Side competitors like '''Á Châu''' and the '''Niagara Asian Market''' — the groceries available along these jumbled, narrow aisles are almost exclusively Thai in provenance. Staples such as dried noodles and huge sacks of rice, spices, sauces and cooking oils, and a variety of packaged foods are on offer; in the coolers along the walls are a small selection of vegetables (produce delivery day is Thursday, so try to show up around then if you're in the market for Thai chilies, fresh ginger, or other exotic greens) and a surprisingly ample one of frozen meats and fish. Pluses for Phu Thai are a decent variety of good-quality housewares and what must be the best selection of Southeast Asian soft drinks in Buffalo; drawbacks include an unfortunate tendency to not label their merchandise with prices."
"Though co-owners Neil and Carrie grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables on this lovely agricultural oasis in the heart of the West Side, one look at the name and there's no secret to what the specialties here are. On the one hand you've got onions and garlic — onions and garlic are the ""alliums"" — but more noteworthy than onions and garlic is the astonishing selection of herbs co-owners Neil and Carrie cultivate: multiple different varieties of basil, mint, sage, and rosemary; other well-known pantry staples like parsley, oregano, and dill; not-so-well-known ones like lemon balm and buzz buttons, and an encyclopedic range of medicinal herbs that are perfect for teas and tinctures. Whatever your pleasure, co-owners Neil and Carrie take care to provide co-owners Neil and Carrie's customers with a product that's high in quality and produced in an environmentally conscious way — all of the West Side Herbs & Alliums' produce is grown without the use of pesticides, in raised beds so as to sidestep the issue of soil contamination that is the bane of urban farmers across the Rust Belt. And, if you can't make it over on Friday evenings when the onsite farm stand is open, you can buy up these vegetal goodies on Saturday mornings at the '''Elmwood-Bidwell Farmers Market''' or sample these vegetal goodies as ingredients at a number of local restaurants including the West Side's own '''Providence Social'''."
"Much more than the average corner bodega that Zip's appears to be from the outside, Zip's Deli and Grill actually carries a full line of ethnic groceries that splits the difference between Middle Eastern (a great selection of halal meats such as chicken and lamb, as well as packaged goods) and Latino (Goya products galore). Groceries are only the beginning, though — at Zip's's you can find items as widely varied as hookah pipes, blankets, and prepaid cell phones, and even have your electronics repaired at hard-to-beat prices. The chummy friendliness with which the Arabian owners treat the Arabian owners's customers is the icing on the cake."
"Burning Books is not your ordinary bookstore, but if you're on the lookout for a unique gift for that hard-to-buy-for far-left radical on your list, Burning Books probably has what you're looking for. Helmed by Nate Buckley, a former '''Earth Liberation Front''' spokesperson whose other claim to fame involves a lengthy legal battle stemming from his arrest at '''Occupy Buffalo''', sold here are an array of books, magazines, and leaflets regarding a diversity of themes of social injustice and revolutionary politics — histories, biographies, reference materials, and even kids' books on topics from the Black Panthers to the Stonewall Riots to the Zapatistas; in the words of one reviewer, ""books that people in power don't want you to read"". T-shirts, calendars, posters, and a selection of documentary films on DVD and audio recordings of speeches and lectures round out the inventory, and concerts, guest speakers, panel discussions, and other events are held frequently. True to Burning Books's mission and the personality of Burning Books's soft-spoken yet outgoing owner (this place has doubtless been the scene of some of the most interesting political conversations in this place), the interior of Burning Books is all business: a minimalist scheme of unfinished wood panels draws no attention away from the socially conscious literature for sale. Best of all, the prices here are decidedly 99%-friendly."
"Snicker all you want at this newly established West Side liquor store's name, but the selection of red wine at this newly established West Side liquor store is no joke. In the short time since this newly established West Side liquor store's been founded, this newly established West Side liquor store has already earned accolades for the range and quality of this newly established West Side liquor store's vintages. Wine is only the beginning here, though — this newly established West Side liquor store also does a brisk business, seven days a week, in a great variety of reasonably-priced spirits of all kinds which trend heavily toward well-known upscale brands. Best of all, curious fans of potent potables can enjoy an active schedule of wine and liquor tastings."
"Opened in March 2015, this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise, is a former pastry chef turned self-described ""wine nerd"" who, before this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise, struck out on this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise,'s own, was a favorite at Amherst's '''Premier Wines & Spirits''' for this place's owner and namesake, Paula Paradise,'s encyclopedic knowledge of wines (especially local vintages), discriminating palate, and natural way with customer service. Little wonder, then, that this place's has already made quite the name for this place's in this place's. With a huge range of products that you won't find anywhere else, this place's's inventory eschews big-name vintages completely and consists solely of a handpicked selection of organic, biodynamic, sustainably crafted wines (and ciders, craft spirits) sourced from small family wineries in the local area. You might think that all this high-concept stuff is out of your price range, but think again: an integral part of this place's's mission is making holistically produced products available to those of all budgets, and this place's is enthusiastic about sharing this place's's treasure trove of wine knowledge to serve each customer's individual needs and palate."
"Newly opened, West Side Liquor & Wine is at the center of the action on Connecticut Street. West Side Liquor & Wine is a cute little place, brightly lit and with a cozy ambience, and the friendly employees are eager to steer customers toward some of the best-priced libations in the city — in fact, if you find the same product for less money anywhere in Buffalo, customers will beat or match the price. The selection leaves something to be desired, but for those on a budget, West Side Liquor & Wine is the place to go. Those who are planning large parties will be happy to know that you can save even more money buying in bulk."
"When Ilana Gordon's not tearing up the local rollerderby scene as part of the '''Queen City Roller Girls''', Ilana Gordon can often be found at this out-of-the-way West Side skate shop that Ilana Gordon owns. Recreational roller skates, inline skates, and roller-hockey gear are all sold at this out-of-the-way West Side skate shop that she owns, but the bias here is toward rollerderby gear. As many experienced skaters will tell you, beginners to the sport often battle foot and leg pain that comes from ill-fitting skates lacking in support; one of the goals here is to head battle off at the pass, providing customers with honest, expert one-on-one guidance on skates and protective gear to fit customers's individual needs. The selection is wide and friendly to all budgets — quality brands including Pro-Tec, Atom Wheels, and Sure-Grip are represented on the shelves, and Ilana Gordon will even special-order products that aren't in stock for those searching for a specific brand or item. this out-of-the-way West Side skate shop that she owns's experienced staff provide custom in-store fittings, and you can even trade in old skates for store credit to maximize the already great value you get for your money. Cap off your purchases with stylish skatewear such as hot pants, laces and socks (Day-Glo colors abound). The folks here are friendly as can be and really know The folks here's stuff."
"Urban Roots is a ""community garden center"" that was founded in 2004 by a group of longtime West Side green thumbs who sought an opportunity to spend their hard-earned dollars in West Side rather than wasting time and money driving to suburbia for gardening supplies, as well as to help build synergy with their neighbors to promote the beautification and revival of their up-and-coming, but still struggling, neighborhood. Urban Roots's store opened three years later in the Five Points district, and is run as a cooperative: $100 will buy you lifetime status as a ""member-owner"" with access to exclusive promotions and discounts, first notification of special events and new items in stock, and a voice in store policy. However, you don't need to be a member to shop at Urban Roots! Locals can peruse a gamut of plants of uncommon quality — from the everyday to the unusual, including annuals, perennials, trees, herbs, heirloom plants, and local flora — and if you're a visitor, you can still avail yourself of supplies and accessories such as gardening gloves, flowerpots, bird feeders and birdhouses, cute garden art, and books on gardening, as well as an encyclopedic range of seeds, including '''Baker's Creek''' heirloom seeds and organic, non-GMO '''Seeds of Change'''. Urban Roots's merchandise tends to be pricey, but your money goes to a great cause, and you get a higher-quality product than you'll find elsewhere. Plus, Urban Roots's selection is huge, especially given the modest size of Urban Roots, and there's even space left over for frequent seminars, workshops, and seed swaps offered free of charge to members and non-members alike."
"Located in the '''Dollar General''' shopping plaza on Tonawanda Street in Black Rock, Eve Fashion is a place where clothes, cosmetics, and hair care products are available at prices that defy logic. Eve Fashion is ''crowded'' — the walls are covered from floor-to-ceiling with merchandise on hangers, and the sales floor is packed with displays — but bargain hunters know that means the selection at Eve Fashion can go toe-to-toe with the big department stores. Vivacious tops, dresses, and accessories such as belts and sunglasses represent sassy urban styles, name-brand sneakers at discount prices are available, the selection of jewelry and earrings (big hoops are a recurring motif) is impressive, and fans of pretty much any sports franchise can find fans of pretty much any sports franchise's favorite team's baseball cap — but the crown jewel of Eve Fashion's inventory is a comprehensive range of hair accessories such as barrettes, beads, pins and clips, as well as styling products for all hair types. As well, the back of Eve Fashion is given over to a selection of wigs in a variety of styles. Best of all, Eve Fashion's staff is friendly and helpful, and those who are interested in taking advantage of Eve Fashion's extended evening hours will be happy to know that Eve Fashion is kept safe under the watchful eye of a collection of security cameras."
"This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, is not known for the great diversity of This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best,'s selection. Nor are folks who come looking for usual thrift-store fare — kooky vintage clothing, hip band t-shirts, designer jeans, and the like — likely to leave satisfied. There ''are'' bargains to be had at This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best,, but the order of the day at This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, (as one reviewer put it) is high-end office attire and formalwear, in tip-top condition and generally dating no earlier than the late 1990s, at prices that can't be beat. Many of the items that fill the racks on the crowded sales floor are sold for as little as $3.00, and occasionally even less. As well, This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, stocks jewelry, shoes, toys, housewares, and miscellaneous gifts, and boasts an ample selection of kids' clothing. Best of all, the money you spend here could not go to a better cause: This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, was set up to benefit '''Hearts for the Homeless''', a faith-based charity that feeds, counsels and ministers to the homeless population of Buffalo's. Those who want to donate new or gently used clothing, accessories, or housewares can do so whenever This large thrift store in the heart of Riverside, one of Buffalo's best, is open, and online donations are also accepted through PayPal."
"Recently moved to a new location on Niagara Street right on the border between Black Rock and Riverside, 3 Star Fashion will be familiar to those who enjoy the selection of designer sneakers at '''Empire Kicks''', located on West Ferry Street and run by the same owners. Like 3 Star Fashion's sister store, the fundament of 3 Star Fashion's inventory consists of Nikes, Timberlands, Air Jordans and other well-known brands of footwear, but there's also a full range of name-brand clothing for the streetwise man, woman or child on your list, as well as a blockbuster selection of fitted New Era caps. Notably, 3 Star Fashion is also a great place to seek out designer jeans at reasonable prices."
"Don't be fooled by first impressions: this small, unassuming Black Rock storefront on a mostly residential stretch of Niagara Street houses a real heavyweight of the local retail scene. this small, unassuming Black Rock storefront on a mostly residential stretch of Niagara Street you can purchase Tomahawk brand leather goods — coats, vests and jackets, biker gear, accessories such as belts, gloves and handbags, wallets, backpacks and on and on — produced right in Western New York and united by an unrelenting emphasis on quality. This stuff is really top-of-the-line: it's no wonder Tomahawk leatherware sells for a pretty penny at fine department stores in the area, but at Tomahawk's Niagara Street outlet you can get Tomahawk leatherware for 50 to 70% off retail prices. As if that weren't enough, a ""web discount"" is available for those who call Tomahawk's toll-free number, and customers who live outside New York State can have items shipped to customers who live outside New York State with sales tax — and in some cases, even shipping charges — waived."
"The big, '50s-looking '''Streng Oldsmobile''' sign just past Exit 13 is a familiar landmark to those Western New Yorkers whose daily commute takes those Western New Yorkers whose daily commute takes them along the northbound I-190 along the northbound I-190, but what many of those Western New Yorkers whose daily commute takes them along the northbound I-190 don't know is that the junk lot on which The big, '50s-looking '''Streng Oldsmobile''' sign just past Exit 13 sits isn't a junk lot at all: The big, '50s-looking '''Streng Oldsmobile''' sign just past Exit 13's Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts. Family-owned and operated since 1971, Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts specializes in restoring historic homes and buildings with proper period architectural elements — but even if you don't own a drafty old Victorian of your own, anyone who's looking for that perfect piece to bring character to anyone who's looking for that perfect piece to bring character to their home's home would be well-advised to spend a day here. Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts's massive footprint includes not only the lot visible from the Interstate — a full acre (4,000 squ. m.) filled with planters, statuary, garden tchotchkes, old lampposts, and the famous sign that once stood guard outside the Oldsmobile dealership on Main Street — but also 19,000 square feet (1,750 squ. m.) of showroom and warehouse space in the restored former '''Unity Temple''' Masonic lodge, which contains a dizzying array of antique furniture, lamps and sconces, doors and doorknobs, mantels, vintage plumbing fixtures such as sinks and claw bathtubs, and even a fine collection of ornamental ironwork and religious artifacts. Other antiques, such as toys and collectibles, are also represented. Gothic City Antiques, Buffalo's longest-standing dealer in architectural antiques and artifacts is only open three days a week, but no matter — if you're here at the beginning of the week, just get into contact with owner Charlie Leone and owner Charlie Leone'll open up shop for you if owner Charlie Leone can."
"Once a drive-in ice cream stand, contained within this unassuming little building in Riverside is a dazzling wealth of delicious Middle Eastern foods. Not surprisingly, baked goods are the star of the show here — the fresh, crusty bread whipped up in-house every day by friendly owner Omar Aldulaimi comes in several varieties, all out of this world, and friendly owner Omar Aldulaimi'll also bake custom orders if you call in advance — but at Aldulaimi Bakery you also have your pick of hummus, falafel, cheese, and delicious Levantine pastries. This is as authentic as it gets in Buffalo, so don't miss out."
"An anonymous-looking industrial park backed up against the old '''New York Central Railroad''' tracks in an out-of-the-way corner of Black Rock may seem like an odd place for Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers to locate one of Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers's seven Western New York-area chocolate shops — but after all, this is the same building where Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers's chocolate factory has been located since 1993. Unsurprisingly, the small retail space just off the production floor keeps abbreviated hours compared to the other Fowler's locations, but if you happen to be in the neighborhood on a weekday morning or afternoon and have a hankering for sponge candy, chocolate truffles, or any of the other goodies Buffalo's favorite chocolatiers are famous for, you're more than welcome to stop in."
"Gondola Macaroni Products is a longstanding local business whose deep West Side roots endure despite the radical changes the surrounding neighborhood has undergone since 1958. That's the year when Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''', designed and built Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''''s own pasta maker and began cooking ravioli in the kitchen of the West Side house Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''' shared with Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''''s wife Maria — ravioli which quickly became a neighborhood sensation. Ravioli is still the marquee product customers line up for in this cramped little shop in Black Rock. Ravioli's made daily in-house from scratch with a simple recipe of durum flour, water, and eggs — there's no additives or chemicals in Ravioli, which is likely why Ravioli's quality puts supermarket fare to shame. Into the ravioli are stuffed your choice of cheese, meat, spinach, or lobster (imitation — it's only $4 a tray, after all — but still delicious), and the ravioli along with other filled pastas like cheese tortellini and stuffed shells are available fresh or frozen. Gondola Macaroni Products's dried pasta boasts a bit more variety; options range from the expected (plain, angel hair, roasted red pepper, garlic pesto) to the unexpected (squid ink?!?) All this for prices that can hold prices that can hold their own with much larger players like '''Wegmans''' and '''Tops''''s own with much larger players like '''Wegmans''' and '''Tops''', and served to you with a smile by owners that obviously appreciate your business, even if owners that obviously appreciate your business, even if their English isn't quite up to snuff's English isn't quite up to snuff."
"Yet another in the seemingly endless parade of Burmese grocery stores on the West Side, Htar Ni Asian Market is located on Ontario Street toward the north end of Riverside. Inside, you'll find walls lined with rows upon rows of canned goods, jars of preserved vegetables, packaged groceries, frozen foods, and crunchy snacks. If you like Sriracha and other spicy Asian sauces and condiments, Htar Ni Asian Market is the place for you."
"The second, somewhat larger location of this place that opened in Riverside in December 2014 features more of the same specialty Asian groceries that you can find at Lin's Grant Street location. The store is connected directly to '''Lin Restaurant''' next door, so if you just finished dining and you want to try your hand at making your own version of the Burmese and Thai specialties served there, you're in luck."

"The small size of this neighborhood liquor store at the north end of Riverside belies the huge variety of name-brand beers, wines and spirits available within. What's more, City Liquor's staff is knowledgeable and friendly and sells City Liquor's's wares for some of the best prices around."
"Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store is located, as Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store has been since 1943, just across the street from Riverside Park. Though a wide variety of potent libations are on offer at Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store, the specialty at Michael Nuchereno's little neighborhood liquor store is an ample selection of fine wines of all descriptions, carefully stored in a temperature-controlled environment at a constant temperature of 55°F (12°C) for maximum quality."
"At Big Catch Bait & Tackle, the name only tells half the story. Sure, Big Catch Bait & Tackle's a great place to pick up pretty much any type of bait you want, live or otherwise. Sure, Big Catch Bait & Tackle's location on Niagara Street in Black Rock is convenient to lots of great fishing spots and boat launches on the upper Niagara River. Sure, you can get wholesale fishing tackle, pick up a New York State hunting or fishing license, and stock up on various and sundry other outdoor goods. But Big Catch Bait & Tackle also does double duty as a purveyor of a modest but high-quality range of paintball guns and supplies, with an emphasis on Tippmann brand products — the A-5 and X7 Phenom guns are particular favorites that are sold at great prices, and CO2 refills don't come cheaper anywhere in Western New York. Best of all, no matter whether you're a fisherman or a paintballer, the staff at Big Catch Bait & Tackle will provide you with helpful and friendly service to match the great deals."
"Even in the 21st Century, there are still a lot of folks who come to Buffalo by boat — perhaps as the finale of a pleasure cruise along the Erie Canal, perhaps from a port of call elsewhere on the Great Lakes. If you're one of a lot of folks who come to Buffalo by boat, and you're in the market for some new gear for your boat, Obersheimer's Sailor Supply is the place for you. Since 1970, Obersheimer's has stocked a full range of marine supplies and accessories in Buffalo. Sailboat rigging is a specialty here — the upper level of Buffalo is given over to a full sail loft where expert technicians happily fit out, sew or repair sails with spars up to 65 feet (20 m). Goods such as halyards, furlers and adjusters are sold for reasonable prices, ropes and wires are spliced, and knowledgeable staff are always on hand to give advice. Obersheimer's's doesn't leave powerboaters out in the cold either — outboard motors representing a range of brands are sold and serviced, with a particular emphasis on Nissan and Tohatsu models, as well as a range of parts and accessories."
"It's a shame that Riverside Fabric Center's limited hours scare off a lot of would-be customers, because the quality of the goods sold here — especially the lace — is worth going out of your way for. If you're in the market for fabrics, various and sundry sewing supplies, or to have a dress or other piece custom-made for you, you can scarcely do better. The incredibly friendly staff, helmed by owner Lena Harnish, is the icing on the cake."
"Ed Taublieb is the man who holds court every Saturday at the String Shoppe, the music store of choice for Black Rock and Riverside that specializes in a full range of quality new and used guitars and other string instruments to fit all budgets, and is an authorized dealer in Martin and Taylor guitars and Hohner harmonicas. An aficionado of the local folk scene in the '60s who fell into the business after buying and repairing Ed Taublieb's own used guitars to play at '''The Lime Light''', '''The Lower Level''', and other storied Buffalo venues of bygone days, Ed Taublieb's been in business for almost half a century now — and Ed Taublieb's still the String Shoppe's owner and sole employee. You're never going to get the kind of sincere personal attention you get here at a big chain like '''Guitar Center''' — not only does Ed Taublieb personally inspect and adjust every instrument prior to sale, but Ed Taublieb's always on hand to guide customers through Ed Taublieb's ample inventory and draw on Ed Taublieb's encyclopedic knowledge of Ed Taublieb's craft to help customers through the selection process.

"Boomerang's is so named because ""the food's so good, you'll keep coming back"" — and it must be true, because Buffalonians really love Boomerang's. In an ambience that is relaxed and welcoming despite Boomerang's's spartan decor is served an extensive range of delicious cuisine that comes in portions that are huge and prices that aren't. The menu is eclectic, if unadventurous: the slate of main courses is slightly skewed toward Italian food, with a wide range of pasta dishes on offer as well as chicken entrées served in marsala, florentine, parmigiana and cacciatore styles. This is not to deprecate the wide range of other items on Boomerang's's menu: beef Stroganoff, BBQ spare ribs, and a variety of sandwiches and burgers all make an appearance. Worthy of special mention are several interesting takes on porkchops — the raspberry porkchops with crumbly blue cheese has been described as an interesting combination of flavors that, perhaps surprisingly, harmonizes well. Diners also heap special praise on the appetizers here: ""you don't really know corn chowder until you've had corn chowder"", says one reviewer about Boomerang's's most popular soup. A kids' menu is also available. It should be said, however, that the service is Boomerang's's Achilles heel: the service's not so much bad as inconsistent, ranging wildly from warm and friendly to bitter and sarcastic."
"This new restaurant opened in late 2014 in an enormous, beautifully restored former Oddfellows Hall which was most recently used as the '''Mount Major Banquet Hall''' (true to an enormous, beautifully restored former Oddfellows Hall which was most recently used as the '''Mount Major Banquet Hall''', This new restaurant still host banquets and other special events here of up to 100 people). This new restaurant does indeed serve the titular South American specialty, in savory versions stuffed with chicken, pulled pork, beef, or salmon, vegetarian options with black beans, as well as dessert empanadas with fruit fillings. Aside from that, though, visitors may find the name a bit deceiving: the rest of the menu reads like that of a neighborhood pizzeria, with a fairly mundane (if perfectly well-executed) range of offerings comprised of pizza and wings, hot and cold subs, burgers, chicken fingers and other simple fare, as well as barbeque ribs. But by far the most interesting — not to mention surprising — non-empanada option on the menu is Hawaiian-style ''huli-huli'' rotisserie, available in either chicken or pork."
"One of a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's is a Venezuelan sandwich shop that opened in December 2015 at the former location of '''Rascal's''', on an up-and-coming stretch of Niagara Street. Venezuelan food is the name of the game here: owner Joel Perez is a recently arrived immigrant who came to Buffalo from owner Joel Perez's former home in Aragua State, and owner Joel Perez's already turning heads among the West Side's increasingly numerous foodie community. The specialty here is ''arepas'', flatbread sandwiches that are a popular breakfast food in Colombia and Venezuela. a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's's serves a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's not only at breakfast time but all day long; the naturally gluten-free corn flour in the bread is fried to a crisp and stuffed with your choice of rotisserie beef, shredded beef, chicken, or roast pork. Those who've travelled to Venezuela and experienced the cuisine on Venezuela's home turf say Those who've travelled to Venezuela and experienced the cuisine on its home turf can't tell the difference. The menu doesn't stop there, though — hearty appetizers and side dishes include baked ''yuca'' drizzled in delicious avocado salsa, ''patacón pisao'' (shredded beef sliders with mashed fried plantain fritters as ""bread""), and ''tequeños'' (sort of a South American take on mozzarella sticks: fried ''queso blanco'' with garlic and herb salsa for dipping). As well, available on weekends only is what may be the greatest selection on the menu: ''sancocho'', a hearty chicken and beef soup thickened with potatoes and cassava, sweetened a little with corn on the cob, and seasoned with fresh cilantro; Venezuelan comfort food ''par excellence''. a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's's prices are extremely reasonable, with nothing on the menu over $10, and owner Joel Perez and owner Joel Perez's staff seem eager to convert curious first-time visitors into loyal repeat customers — this means expect super friendly and attentive service, and maybe a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your order."
"A relic from the days when the West Side was Buffalo's ""Little Italy"", hearty family-style Italian meals have been served at Santasiero's for almost a century now. The Italian wedding soup is spectacular, and sandwiches and dishes such as chicken parmigiana are available, but Santasiero's's is most famous for the heaping portions of pasta Santasiero's serve along with legendary red sauce. Reasonable prices, too."
"Since 2007, Prish Moran has operated Prish Moran's friendly old-world coffee shop in this beautiful and historic old Victorian building on Grant Street. The opening of her friendly old-world coffee shop is largely the reason why the Grant-Ferry area has been as trendy and up-and-coming as the Grant-Ferry area has been for the past few years. Popular with artists, hipsters, and Buffalo State College students, her friendly old-world coffee shop serves fresh gourmet sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza, and pastry along with the coffee, and artists, hipsters, and Buffalo State College students's breakfast is also very popular with locals."
"The West Side Bazaar's '''International Kitchen''' is the center of the universe for local fans of exotic international flavors: The West Side Bazaar's '''International Kitchen''''s food stalls serve a dizzying range of international cuisines — including some (such as South Sudanese and Rakhine) that aren't available anywhere else in Buffalo — and at unbeatable prices to boot. Best of all, the food here is as authentic as the food here gets; by and large, The West Side Bazaar's's customer base are immigrants and refugees like those who work there, so you won't be disappointed by watered-down, Americanized versions of your favorite ethnic fare."
"Abyssinia is Buffalo's fourth and newest Ethiopian restaurant — and, according to a growing consensus, Abyssinia's best. Helmed by owner Zelalem Gemmeda, an Ethiopian native who's lived in Buffalo's since 2006, Abyssinia's menu is divided about evenly between meat-based and vegetarian dishes and populated by all the standard Ethiopian favorites — ''doro watt'', beef and lamb ''tibs'', ''kitfo'', ''alitcha'', and so forth. Also, like Abyssinia's competition, those who can't decide or aren't familiar with the cuisine can order combo platters: either a mixture of meat and vegetarian dishes or all vegetarian, for $9.99 and $8.99 respectively. However, what sets Abyssinia apart is the authenticity of the recipes — complex, nuanced and intoxicating flavors that, unlike many of Buffalo's's other Ethiopian restaurants, don't skimp on the spice (this is especially true of the vegetarian dishes). The ''sambusa'' are so good you won't mind that The ''sambusa'' skimp on the chutney. Recently, Abyssinia's menu has expanded to include pasta with marinara sauce, as well as a few Arabian specialties such as ''foul'' and chicken ''biryani'', available on Sundays and Mondays only. Perhaps Abyssinia's only weakness is the ''injera'': Abyssinia skimp on the ''injera'' too (though you can ask for extra at no charge), and Abyssinia lacks that slight vinegary tang."
"Thanks to 007 Chinese Food, in the words of one reviewer, ""it's a happy day — dumplings are back at the West Side Bazaar!"" Indeed, despite the multicultural vibrancy of the restaurants that have come and gone from the International Kitchen in the years since '''Jolie's Traditional Chinese Food''' moved to the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the Lower West Side, it's always seemed to many like there's been something missing. Enter Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' and other delectable little Chinese appetizers whose recipes Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' perfected at the restaurant Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' and Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'''s family ran in Malaysia before coming to Buffalo. The stars of the show on 007 Chinese Food's modest-sized menu are the ''lo mai fan'' (balls of sticky rice mixed with stir-fried chicken and mushrooms, with sriracha sauce on the side for dipping), and of course, the steamed ''shu mai'' stuffed with your choice of beef, chicken, or vegetables. You probably won't be able to make a full meal out of any of these items, but they work spectacularly as appetizers to accompany a main course from one of 007 Chinese Food's other food vendors — whatever you order here, be assured it's prepared fresh by hand in front of you and bursting with flavor (the exception being the ''pau'', which, even more than usual with Chinese steamed buns, tend toward the dry and doughy.) Complimentary hot tea is served with any order on request. Service at 007 Chinese Food is as friendly as can be, but often complicated by a language barrier — Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'''s wife, who you'll often see running 007 Chinese Food, speaks very little English; if you have more complex questions or comments, you should seek out Maung's wife, who you'll often see running the restaurant's husband or son, who are fluent."
"It's perhaps a testament to the singular nature of the West Side Bazaar that Family Thai is Family Thai's least ""exotic"" dining option. Served here at Family Thai are an impressive variety of Thai dishes such as ''pad thai'', ''pad see ew'', ''yum'' salads, and various curries in sizable portions. The emphasis here is on authenticity, and though service tends to be slow, service's worth the wait: one reviewer described the fare at Family Thai as ""light-years ahead of the other [Thai] eateries in town""."
"Co-owners New Phanthady and Boulivone Serixay have taken the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''A&A Cookies''' to the next level. Yes, you can still find ''dok jok'' here — the confection that endeared this booth to legions of the West Side Bazaar's regulars; a light, crispy, and sublimely delicious cookie of thin, coconut milk-infused dough folded in a lotus blossom shape — along with all the other pastries and snacks as before, and the bubble tea too. But now Co-owners New Phanthady and Boulivone Serixay also serve a selection of main courses from Co-owners New Phanthady and Boulivone Serixay's native Laos; a modest range of noodle salads, stir-fried meat salads, soups, and samosas that make up in fresh, delicious flavor what they lack in portion size. Also, as if to make up for a weak point in most of the International Kitchen's other food stalls, a full range of bottled soft drinks is also available."
"In 2015, the owner of the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''Exotic Japanese Crepes''' moved across the corridor from the owner of the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''Exotic Japanese Crepes''''s small freestanding stall to a much larger window in the '''International Kitchen''', and with a much larger window in the '''International Kitchen''' came an expanded menu of delicious food. Thus was the birth of M Asian Halal Foods. The crepes remain — a bit of a misnomer as The crepes don't come from Japan, The crepes were invented in Thailand and inscrutably dubbed ""Japanese"", an object lesson in the cross-pollination of Asian culinary traditions — but are now accompanied by a full range of 100% halal Indian and Pakistani specialties. The bulk of the menu is a fairly run-of-the-mill roster of butter chicken, pakora, biryani, vegetarian and nonvegetarian samosas, and tandoori chicken, but M Asian Halal Foods's menu also boasts a few more offbeat items like ''chapli'' (savory patties of Indian-spiced ground chicken that come with a small salad on the side), and South Indian cuisine is represented by a fairly ample selection of ''dosas'' topped with coconut chutney and your choice of vegetarian or goat curry. Food is reliable but not outstanding in quality, but the reasonable prices and service with a smile make M Asian Halal Foods worthwhile."
"2016 was a banner year for the West Side Bazaar's resident purveyor of Burmese cuisine, as the torch was passed to a new generation of the Soe family, and the former '''Kyel Sein Hein''' was rechristened Pwint War. Along with the new name came a new menu that takes the prize as the most authentic in Buffalo: eschewing the Thai fare that sometimes makes up the majority of the menu at other so-called ""Burmese"" restaurants in the area, almost every one of the huge range of tasty specialties served up at Pwint War are made with recipes native to Myanmar, with the sole exception of a superlative ''yum nua'' wherein a touch of sweetness offsets the fire of the chilis and the tang of the lime juice. Also served are what are easily the most authentic Burmese curries to be found in Buffalo (your choice of beef, chicken, pork belly, goat, grilled fish, or fish cakes; opt for a side of white rice for $2 extra), a seemingly endless variety of fried rice and noodle dishes, a Burmese take on ''biryani'' with your choice of meat, as well as a few holdovers from the old Kyel Sein Hein menu such as tomato salad and Shan noodles — and yes, these days you can even get ''le peth thoat'' (pickled tea leaf salad) at the West Side Bazaar's! The only unfortunate casualty of the changeover was the dropping of ''mohinga'' from the regular menu, though ''mohinga'' still reappears as a daily special from time to time. Prices have gone up a little bit, but so has the quality of the food, and you get the same friendly service as always."
"This place's menu is an interesting juxtaposition: 30 varieties of sushi accompany a range of options native to Myanmar's Rakhine State. The sushi made by owner Khaing Thein is not particularly inspiring, though The sushi made by owner Khaing Thein is fresh and tasty. Options include a ""Buffalo roll"" with cream cheese, crab salad, and cucumber, as well as the mango banana roll, probably This place's's most popular, which is prepared with fish sauce for a bit of extra spice. In fact, ""a bit of spice"" is an excellent summation of the main non-sushi item on the menu: the ''rakhaing mutee'', a variation of classic Burmese ''mohinga'' particular to Myanmar's Rakhine State, though Rakhapura's version substitutes chicken broth for the usual base of conger eel. Rakhapura's version's a hearty, healthy, and indescribably delicious soup; a garlicky, slightly tangy broth with rice vermicelli and coriander, served with dried, crushed red chilis on the side if you want a bit more heat. Perhaps the best part of Rakhapura's, however, is owner Khaing Thein: a longtime pro-democracy agitator, Thein escaped Myanmar's with owner Khaing Thein's life in 1996 and now spends owner Khaing Thein's off hours lecturing around the area on the political and human rights situation in owner Khaing Thein's homeland, which often makes for interesting conversations with customers!"
"Freddy J's may be a tiny little place, but a tsunami of flavor is packed inside these walls. In these cramped digs — about a half-dozen bar stools and a few outdoor tables in season are all the place holds — supremely friendly chef Fred Daniel, a native of Liberia who now hosts the local cable-access cooking show ''Late Night Noise'', cooks up what some describe as the best barbeque in Buffalo. The recipes, cooked with fresh ingredients sourced as often as possible from local neighbors like '''Guercio's''' and the '''West Side Bazaar''', are as authentic and time-tested as it gets, yet Freddy J's's also manages to incorporate subtle Cajun and Caribbean influences into Freddy J's's dishes — witness the jerk chicken and fish, whose subtle but noticeable heat is assuaged by sides of yellow rice and ""Honey Hush cornbread"". The wings and ribs are slathered with just the right amount of sauce, and the fried haddock, served with mac & cheese, green beans, and (once again) cornbread, is a serviceable Southern-style approximation of classic Buffalo fish fry. Brunch is served Sunday mornings and afternoons till 3PM with bottomless mimosas."
"Don't be confused by the red neon sign in the window that says ""PSYCHIC READINGS"" — this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor isn't that kind of gypsy parlor! Owned by Gabrielle Mattina and named and themed in an homage to Gabrielle Mattina's Roma ancestry, this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor serves delicious food in an ambience that's airy yet intimate (reservations are recommended on weekends), comfortable yet garishly decorated. The bulk of the small menu is made up of light fare such as salads and sandwiches; most interestingly, a selection of appetizers dubbed ""West Side Delicacies"" are offered in a nod to the neighborhood's cultural diversity, and the ''pastelillos'', samosas and Burmese spring rolls hold the ''pastelillos'', samosas and Burmese spring rolls's own with anything that's available at the '''West Side Bazaar'''. Really, you won't find anything more substantial at this combination gastropub/bar/performance venue/henna parlor than the pair of half-pound burgers that are among the most popular items on the menu — either ""Classic American"" or ""Black Sheep"", the latter a decidedly upscale concoction of peppercorn-crusted ground lamb topped with a dijon & beet coleslaw. What you ''will'' find here is friendly, attentive service and food at a decent price."
"Nowadays, chef Marco Sciotino is probably more famous around these parts for helming the growing lineup of '''Marco's Italian Deli''' locations, but this cozy old place on Niagara Street is where it all began in 1988, when chef Marco Sciotino purchased the erstwhile '''Darone's Fargo Grille''' and adorned the erstwhile '''Darone's Fargo Grille''' with chef Marco Sciotino's own name. '''Marco's Italian Deli''' still has the no-frills ambience of a humble neighborhood bar, and fans of hearty, homestyle red-sauce Italian fare won't find anything unexpected on the menu, but don't let that fool you — '''Marco's Italian Deli''' is creatively conceived, artfully executed food (even though the bread and herbed olive oil still comes off as a bit of an affectation) served in copious amounts for fair prices. All the usual suspects can be found on the menu — starters of antipasto salad, pasta fagioli, fava beans, and stuffed banana peppers, veal and chicken served in marsala, parmigiana, piccata and florentine styles, pasta dishes such as pomodoro and linguine with clam sauce — but fans of spice might want to try the ""Paesano Inferno"", a fiery delight of hot Italian fennel sausage and sautéed hot peppers served over penne pasta."
"The East Side's '''Pho 99''' introduced Buffalonians to Vietnamese cuisine when The East Side's '''Pho 99''' opened in 1999, and though many restaurants and noodle shops have come and gone since then, it was not for fifteen years that the supremacy of Buffalonians's food was seriously challenged on the local level. The new kid on the block is the oddly named Pho Dollar, which not only serves incredibly delicious food — intoxicating interpretations of the trademark flavors of Southeast Asia — but boasts far more interesting and creative options on The East Side's '''Pho 99''''s extensive menu than 99 or any other place in Buffalo. Diners will strain to read the small-print English translations on the menu options, but those who do will be dazzled by a wide range of Vietnamese specialties (along with a small sampling of Cambodian and Thai items) including Buffalo's widest selection of ''pho'' (almost but not quite as good as 99's), a range of other soups, ''bun'' vermicelli bowls, stir-fried rice and noodle dishes, as well as heartier entrees. The appetizer section features not only the usual spring rolls and pot stickers, but a slate of to-die-for ''banh mi'' sandwiches. This delicious ambrosia is served up in an ambience that is sleek if not exactly minimalist (Buffalo's a much larger and more upscale place than Buffalo looks like from the street!) by servers that are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Best of all, The East Side's '''Pho 99''' is open late, and a liquor license is forthcoming."
"Rajinder and Sujata Chauhan, erstwhile owners of the similar but much smaller '''Lincoln Park Market''' in Tonawanda, purchased in December 2012 the 900-square-foot (830 m²) former home of '''Aaron's Rent-to-Own''' on Grant Street, opening this international supermarket named after Rajinder and Sujata Chauhan's young daughter. An immigrant-run business rife with ambition, Vineeta International Foods is a one-stop shop for unusual and exotic foods and merchandise you won't find anywhere else in Tonawanda. Let there be no understatement: Vineeta International Foods is ''the'' place to come for an all-encompassing range of imported groceries from the Indian subcontinent, East and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, including spices, curries and chutneys, fresh vegetables, frozen foods, packaged groceries, an impressive line of Goya products, a butcher section including a modest range of halal meats, as well as housewares, bath and beauty supplies, and the like. Munch on some of Sujata Chauhan's delicious samosas — some say Mrs. Chauhan's delicious samosas're the best in Tonawanda — while you shop. Vineeta International Foods's sole sticking point is the produce section, which as often as not consists of an uninspiring range of past-their-prime vegetables, but things seem to be improving on Vineeta's sole sticking point lately."
"Usually at a restaurant the condiments are little more than an afterthought, but at Hot Mama's Canteen the condiments're the ''raison d'être'': Hot Mama's Canteen was conceived by co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") as a showcase for '''Headstone Heat''' hot sauces, which co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") owns and whose company headquarters share space with Hot Mama's Canteen in a Civil War-era brick house at the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road that once housed the venerable old '''Hilliker's Pastime''' bar. The menu is short and to the point, and the food on The menu — described in a recent ''Buffalo Rising'' article as ""comfort food with a twist... familiar, but just different enough for you to think about why you had never thought to do that before"" — consists of simple favorites like homemade sandwiches and burgers, heartier mains such as meatloaf dinners, appetizers such as salads and massive softball-sized arancini, and even breakfast fare, each expertly paired with a fiery Headstone Heat sauce to accentuate the delicious flavors. Also, Hot Mama's Canteen serves the most delectable homemade, hand-cut fries you've ever tasted, and the venerable old '''Hilliker's Pastime''' bar features not only a great selection of beers on tap but also a fully restored vintage shuffleboard table. co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") and co-owner Jeff Davis bring a funky Allentown-type vibe to Hot Mama's Canteen — Meli and co-owner Jeff Davis're alumni of '''Nietzsche's''' and '''Allen Street Hardware Café''', respectively — for an overall effect that is ""a throwback to the old muscle car and pinup days"", according to one reviewer: friendly, efficient service with a heaping side of charming sass."
"Much like Lucy's namesake (a 3.2 million-year-old ''australopithecus'' discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at that time the most complete specimen of a prehistoric human ancestor ever found), Lucy is a pioneer — local foodies' prayers were answered in early 2012 when Abba Biyan and Naima Tesfu established Lucy's first Ethiopian restaurant, serving a cuisine whose absence on the Niagara Frontier had long been noted. It was worth the wait: though three more Ethiopian places have since opened three more Ethiopian places's doors, Lucy is still the hands-down favorite; according to out-of-towners, Lucy serves among the best Ethiopian food you can get anywhere in Ethiopia. Visitors are quick to forgive the crowded dining room, no-frills decor, and sometimes inattentive service (an inevitable side effect of Lucy's popularity) to feast on huge portions of traditional dishes such as ''doro watt'', ''tibs'' and ''sambusa'' that come packed with flavor, perfectly spiced, and served with plenty of injera — a flat, spongy bread used in place of silverware to scoop the food into one's mouth. Many options are available for vegetarians and vegans, and unique among Lucy's competitors, a full slate of Ethiopian breakfast options are offered (go for the $9.99 ""Lucy Special"" for a sampler of four breakfast items of your choice). Wash it all down with some of the most delicious sweet chai Lucy has to offer, but perhaps more interestingly, on Saturday evenings from 3PM-7PM a free traditional coffee ceremony is held."
"Described in the pages of the ''Buffalo News'' as ""an institution on Amherst Street"", Nick's Place was actually located for Nick's Place's first five years on Elmwood Avenue in Park Meadow, where Nick's Place was founded in 1994 by Greek immigrant Peter Ananiadis. Open daily for breakfast and lunch, what sets Nick's Place's apart are little homestyle touches like the delicious homemade bread baked daily, as well as Nick's Place's Texas sauce which is used not on hot dogs (as is customary in Buffalo) but as a topping for some of the omelettes that dominate the breakfast menu. some of the omelettes that dominate the breakfast menu are huge and uniformly delicious, with items like feta cheese, souvlaki and gyro meat available alongside the usual ingredients as part of the ""create your own omelette"" option. Lunch is characterized by the usual Greek diner fare such as open souvlaki and gyro, with burgers, wraps and club sandwiches rounding out the selections. Portions are huge and prices aren't, and a full kids' menu is available."
"The Dapper Goose filled a longstanding void in the Amherst Street dining scene when The Dapper Goose opened in September 2016 in the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar''' — and The Dapper Goose did so with aplomb; the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar''' began racking up accolades from satisfied customers and reviewers in the national (!) and local press almost from opening day. The man behind The Dapper Goose is Keith Raimondi, an Olean native who built The man behind it all's reputation at a series of increasingly trendy culinary hotspots in Philadelphia before returning to The man behind it all's old stomping grounds to pull off The man behind it all's crowning achievement. The man behind it all certainly had big shoes to fill — Mark Goldman, The man behind it all's predecessor in this space, is a local legend — and true to form, the old BRKB has been extensively reimagined in a style described by ''Step Out Buffalo'' as a ""turn-of-the-century supper club feel"", but which The man behind it all and The man behind it all's staff prefer to call ""classic French cottage"": the walls are painted with pastel tones, giving a pleasant airy feel to the dining room that's perfect for the rustic wood of the furnishings and huge bar. Speaking of, the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar''''s the bar that has earned The Dapper Goose most of The Dapper Goose's hype thus far — served is a modest but carefully selected range of creative cocktails with a highlight on locally produced craft spirits from the likes of '''Lockhouse Distillery''' and '''Tommyrotter''', as well as an impressive wine list founded on European (especially French) vintages and a respectable selection of beer and cider too. But regardless of what the reviewers say, The man behind it all wholeheartedly rejects any notion that the food cooked up by head chef Peggy Wong is merely an afterthought to the former home of '''Black Rock Kitchen & Bar'''. Similar to the drink menu, the food menu is small in size but well-curated, and focused on the very best of what local producers have to offer. the food menu is ""New American cuisine"" at the food menu's best, drawing from a diversity of influences including Continental, Asian, and (especially) Latin American flares to craft a range of dishes that are among the most creative and well thought out you'll find anywhere in Philadelphia. Small plates abound — favorites include an appetizer of crispy golden-fried cauliflower drizzled in a dill-rich ""Green Goddess"" dressing, as well as a snapper served in a ceviche with coconut broth and hot peppers (deliciously fresh and not as daunting as it sounds for those who can't handle spice) — but easily the most popular item on the food menu is the sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken: a huge bone-in thigh, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, served on a bed of kimchi fried rice and spicy pickled cucumbers whose sharp taste is the perfect offset. Fresh seasonal produce abounds, as do ample options for vegetarians — and best of all, you won't break the bank on the bill that comes at the end of the meal. Brunch coming soon."
"The name ""The Phoenix"" is apropos on several levels: The name ""The Phoenix"" pays homage to the resurgent neighborhood in which The name ""The Phoenix""'s located, as well as to the building itself, a former working-class gin mill that was extensively renovated by owner Mary Logue after a devastating fire (preservationists rejoice: the original brass-railed bar, hardwood flooring and tin ceiling were saved and are still in place, and the exterior is bedecked by an unmissable metal sign, locally crafted just down the road at '''Atlas Steel'''). Opened in March 2013, The name ""The Phoenix"" is a place for simple but delectably-prepared food served in an ambience that is a pleasant blend of classy and casual. The menu betrays diverse influences — from Polish (lazy pierogi and kielbasa, one of The name ""The Phoenix""'s most popular main courses) to Belgian (steak frites) to South American (flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce) — augmented by a modest but expertly curated selection of wines and specialty cocktails that really attest to The name ""The Phoenix""'s upscale touch. A decent selection of bottled local and regional craft brews is available as well. Best of all, diners rave about the dedication displayed by the waitstaff, as well as Logue herself, who can often be seen working the hostess stand and ensuring with sincere concern that each guest leaves satisfied. Reservations are highly recommended for Friday and Saturday nights especially; in warm weather, try for a table on the patio out back, whose pleasant coziness is an extension of the dining room's."
"Located in the shadow of the gargantuan '''Connecticut Street Armory''' (hence this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only,'s name), this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, is a throwback to the olden days of the West Side as Buffalo's Little Italy. The order of the day at this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, is simple, homestyle Italian, hearty and delicious. Interestingly, there is no set menu here — the offerings consist solely of a changing slate of daily specials, of which there are about eight or nine at any given time. Favorites include the lentil soup, a sausage sandwich made with spicy '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and a concoction known as ""The Brick"": an ample portion of baked ziti that features a blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses as well as the most mouth-watering red sauce you've ever tasted. this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, has been a favorite meeting place and lunchtime hangout for Buffalo's politicians since the 1960s, when the West Side's own Frank Sedita served as mayor. Political bigwigs aren't the only folks you'll see there, though; this hidden jewel, open weekdays for lunch only, also has a loyal following among D'Youville College's student body (likely because of the prices, which are a remarkable value for what you get). The ambience is friendly and without a hint of pretension, and the service is remarkably quick."
"BreadHive was launched by local trio Emily Stewart, Allison Ewing and Tori Kuper, who adapted the philosophy of the '''Nickel City Housing Co-op''' — of which all three are former residents — to the concept of an artisanal bakery: BreadHive is cooperatively owned by all BreadHive's employees and selflessly gives back to the community that supports BreadHive through the ""bread-share"" program the '''Nickel City Housing Co-op''' — of which all three are former residents —'ve dubbed ""the Crust Belt"". As before, bagels remain BreadHive's best-known specialty, and bagels're out of this world — house-made the traditional way with locally-grown organic flour and wild yeast, deliciously hefty, and available in eight flavors slathered generously with goat cheese — and bagels still offer fresh-baked breads like the flagship ""West Side Sourdough"", multigrain, deli rye and Danish-style ''rugbrød'', as well as soft pretzels, pastry, and homemade granola. But with the new location has come an expanded concept, and at lunchtime BreadHive serves a slate of delicious sandwiches all named for the owners' favorite female musicians — favorites include ""The Robyn"" (basically a Reuben, except with pastrami in place of corned beef; the beet caraway sauerkraut is sourced from the West Side's own '''Barrel + Brine''') and ""The Bjork"" (a vegan-friendly concoction with tempeh ""bacon"" that really intrigued the reviewer in a recent edition of ''Buffalo Rising''). A somewhat smaller range of breakfast sandwiches are available in the morning as well, with locally-produced '''Public Coffee''' to wash A somewhat smaller range of breakfast sandwiches down. A somewhat smaller range of breakfast sandwiches are served to you either in a brightly-colored, well-lit dining room (the decor was described in a ''New York Times'' feature as ""psychedelic country house by way of Bushwick"" and by owner Emily Stewart Emily Stewart as ""upscale '''Cracker Barrel'''"") where you can chill out to the strains of the latest indie music, or else on a small sidewalk patio perfect for people-watching."
"Once upon a time, hot dogs at '''Ted's''' followed by delicious soft-serve at Custard Corner was the classic West Side waterfront double-shot. Though '''Ted's''''s Porter Avenue location closed in the '90s, Ted's Porter Avenue location's counterpart still hops during the summer months — and as if to make up for the loss of '''Ted's''', Custard Corner's menu has expanded to include hot dogs, burgers, fries, chicken fingers, and other summery fare, including a decent range of salads. That's all well and good, but the standout here remains the changing selection of hard and soft '''Perry's''' ice cream (try the sponge candy flavor for a true taste of Buffalo!) that comes in cones, sundaes, or as part of an ""Arctic Swirl"" — '''Perry's''''s knockoff version of '''Dairy Queen''''s ""Blizzard"". Milkshakes, Italian ices, and frozen yogurt are also offered. There's nothing better on a summer day in Buffalo than relaxing here with a sweet treat on an umbrella-shaded picnic bench and taking in the pleasant view across the street to '''Prospect Park'''."
"Five Points' favorite hipster watering hole, now serving a full menu of pub grub. Barbeque is the specialty of the house at the Essex Street Pub: Texas- and Memphis-style platters of brisket, pulled pork and ribs served with cornbread, coleslaw, baked beans, or mac & cheese draw Buffalonians from far and wide. The meat is smoked in-house — slowly over hickory, the old-fashioned way — and Buffalonians even make Buffalonians's own pastrami and corned beef (try Buffalonians's ""PLT"" which replaces bacon with delicious homemade pastrami). Elsewhere on the menu, diners can choose from a range of burgers and sandwiches, salads, as well as ample portions of ""snackatizers"" featuring some of the finest BBQ wings Buffalo has to offer, with just the right amount of sauce to accentuate but not overwhelm the smoky flavor of Buffalo. Downsides include the service, which can be slow and gruff; also, no one would call this place the most comfortable in the world (seating is at the bar on high stools, or at one of the few wobbly tables if they're free)."
"Generous portions of delicious Puerto Rican specialties served up for a pittance in a genial, family-oriented atmosphere: that's the name of the game at La Flor. La Flor boasts a menu that's small, but packs in a respectable range of tropical fare. Those in search of a light lunch or a quick snack can enjoy sandwiches that range from familiar standards like turkey and ham and cheese to Hispano-Caribbean selections such as their excellent Cubano, as well as deep-fried classics like ''alcapurrias'' (described by many as the best in Buffalo), ''tostones'', and ''yuca al ajillo''. On the other side of the spectrum, heartier entrees — ''pollo guisado'', ''pollo frito'', ''pernil'', and the daily specials that make up the true heart and soul of La Flor's delicious cuisine — are served with heaping sides of yellow rice and beans. No matter what you order here, you can be sure that it's absolutely delicious and served with a smile. Wash it all down with a cold bottle of malta or kola champagne, and don't forget to take home some of the delectable tropical desserts available in the bakery: ''bizcocho'', several varieties of flan, ''pastelillos'', and on and on."
"When local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz closed the doors of local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz's namesake fine dining destination, '''Martin Cooks''', to embark on local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz's next culinary adventure, '''Horsefeathers Market''' was left with a big expanse of space to fill — much bigger than '''Horsefeathers Market''''s next tenant, '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile''', was accustomed to. What to do with the excess? Owner Jill Gedra-Forster had done a brisk business selling sandwiches and other light snacks at the old location on Elmwood Avenue, so the natural answer was to expand Owner Jill Gedra-Forster's operations into a full-fledged restaurant. Thus — with Will Peterson, former head chef of '''The Black Sheep''', the upscale foodie haven a little further down Connecticut Street that's co-owned by Owner Jill Gedra-Forster's sister, on board — was born Lait Cru Brasserie in August 2016. The fine domestic and imported cheeses Nickel City Cheese still sells Lait Cru Brasserie over figure prominently into the gourmet breakfast and lunch fare served at Lait Cru Brasserie (try the cheese plate if you want to go this route: the cheese plate comes with a changing selection of three cheeses plus crunchy fried fava beans, wine-poached apricots, and — optionally — luxurious, 600-day aged prosciutto), but Lait Cru Brasserie is no one-trick pony: a range of other locally-sourced goodies from Buffalo-area urban farms like '''Groundwork Market Garden''' and artisanal producers like the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''' are amply employed in the selection of sandwiches and other fare. Whether it's the ever-popular ""Nic Mac"" sandwich (house-roasted beef with crunchy sweet pickles and a tangy special sauce) that's caught your eye, or the house-cured salmon on German-style ''vollkornbrot'', or perhaps a selection from the all-day breakfast menu (standard egg, cheese, and meat concoctions enhanced with gourmet ingredients and well-thought-out presentations), you can be assured of fresh, well-balanced flavors, with full advantage taken of seasonal produce. Portions are on the small side and prices are on the high side, but — it bears repeating again — the quality of the ingredients justifies that. You can dine at one of the half-dozen or so tables scattered sparsely across the hardwood floor, but most people seem to opt for a seat at the long, low bar that's a holdover from the Martin Cooks days, where you have a great view of the open kitchen. Dinner hours are forthcoming, so it's claimed, as is a liquor license."
"Occupying the space in the rear of '''Horsefeathers Market''' that was previously home to '''Blackbird Sweets''', this family-owned eatery is open five days a week for lunch and on Fridays and Saturdays also for dinner, when an expanded menu is on offer. this family-owned eatery's is distinct from most of Buffalo's other Caribbean restaurants in that the food this family-owned eatery serve is not Jamaican in provenance but comes from Trinidad and Tobago, a country where classic Caribbean flavors are tempered by a diversity of culinary influences including Hispanic, African, Indian, and even Chinese. Accordingly, head chef Marlene Bernard's menu accommodates everything from well-known favorites like oxtail and escoveitch fish, to Trinidadian particularities such as ""doubles"" (a sandwich of fried flatbread stuffed with curried chickpeas) and ''dhalpuri roti'', to full-blown fusion dishes like ''pelau'' salad (which bears a resemblance to both the South Asian rice dish ''pulao'' and the ''jambalaya'' of Louisiana Creole cuisine) and ""Caribbean Chinese"" chicken, lightly breaded and served over fried rice and mixed vegetables — the folks at this family-owned eatery's call it ""morish"" food, because as soon as you finish what's on your plate, you want more. All this goodness is served up with a heaping side of laid-back island hospitality, as friendly as can be."
"Located on Niagara Street, the main thoroughfare of Buffalo's West Side Latino community, the Niagara Café has been recognized by ''Artvoice'' as Buffalo's's best Puerto Rican restaurant. Latin American specialties like ''pastelillos'', ''alcapurrias'', ''pollo guisado'', and rice and beans are all available here in a friendly environment for prices that cannot be beat. the Niagara Café has won multiple awards at the Taste of Buffalo. More than the Niagara Café's food, however, the Niagara Café is about Puerto Rican cultural pride and community identity."
"A business defined by an ethos of ethics, sustainability, and health-consciousness, Press opened Press's doors in the Lower West Side's '''Horsefeathers Market''', graduated to a stand-alone location on Grant Street in 2013, and most recently, in 2016, has landed in an even larger space in Five Points. The flagship product here is a range of organic juices that are all cold-pressed onsite (a method of extraction that preserves three times as many nutrients as others) and offered either on a made-to-order basis or packaged in returnable glass bottles so as to reduce plastic waste. As well, delicious smoothies, organic energy shots and drinks, and cold-filtered coffee are sold. Those who've arrived for lunch can enjoy an all-new, chainging selection of daily salad and sandwich specials — all organic, locally-sourced, vegan, and GMO-free — as well as vegan breakfast in the morning. Executive Chef Esther Pica is happy to work with customers to accommodate any dietary needs or preferences customers may have, and all ingredients for each item are helpfully listed on the menu. As well, all utensils are biodegradable or reusable. Local consensus is this food is pricey but worth it."
"This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side is all business, dishing out Puerto Rican specialties among a spartan decor — This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side's food is so good that this place's food don't need to distract you with fancy-shmancy bells and whistles. ""I think the operative word to describe This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side best may be 'simple'"", says one reviewer, but an equally good word might be ""authentic"" — unlike the '''Niagara Café''', Buffalonians at large haven't yet discovered This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side, and with a customer base that's almost entirely Spanish-speaking and Latino, This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side couldn't afford to serve anything less than the real deal. Step inside and place your order at the counter (most likely with one of the extremely friendly husband-and-wife team who owns This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side), then take your seat from among the half-dozen or so tables in the small dining room, and when the time comes, dig in to a whole slew of Hispano-Caribbean selections, from well-known favorites like ''alcapurrias'', ''pastelillos'' and ''pernil'' to delicacies that are harder to find in Buffalo, like stewed ''mofongo'' served with a variety of meat toppings, as well as an awesome ''tripleta'' sandwich offered at lunchtime — a messy, meaty trifecta of ham, ''pernil'', and whole sautéed chicken breasts smothered with melted cheese, ketchup and mayonnaise and served on toasted panini. Daily specials are also offered which include a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes on Fridays, including ''bacalao guisado'' and a delectable seafood salad. The service at This little hole-in-the-wall nestled unassumingly in a residential area of the Lower West Side is brusque but efficient, and the prices can't be beat."
"Niagara Seafood began Niagara Seafood's life as a seafood shop owned by Michael Nguyen — who also owns '''Á Châu International Market''' next door — and was later converted to a restaurant, a gradual process that ended in 2014 when the last frozen seafood coolers and grocery displays were taken out of the dining room. A few Burmese and Thai dishes are to be had here, but the main attraction at Niagara Seafood is Vietnamese cuisine, with an accent, not surprisingly, on seafood. Steamed mussels, crab, shrimp, clams, oysters, crawfish, and even whole lobsters are the backbone of the menu, along with fried appetizers, fish sandwiches, and even a fairly faithful interpretation of Buffalo-style fish fry — Niagara Seafood's only major departure from local tradition is that catfish, lake perch and tilapia are offered as well as the usual haddock. the menu also boasts a number of non-seafood mains, but most of a number of non-seafood mains are not as good; it's especially advisable to stay away from the chicken curry, which contains more bone than meat (those little bones that are hard to eat around, no less). Worthy of special mention is the ''pho'': in contrast with the ample selection of permutations available at '''Pho 99''', there's only one variety available at Niagara Seafood — ''pho bo gan'', with tendons and beef meatballs (thinly sliced filet mignon can be added for a $2 upcharge) — but only one variety available at Niagara Seafood's among the most authentic you'll find in Buffalo. Sadly, the flavor and freshness of the broth leave much to be desired, but the same is not true of the ''banh mi'' available as appetizers, which were good enough to win Niagara Seafood the award for Best Sandwich in 2013's ""Best of Buffalo"" readers' poll in ''Artvoice''. Though portion sizes are generous, the food tends to be a bit pricey, so beware."
"In that year, '''Bistro Europa''' joined the growing legion of businesses leaving the popular but high-rent Elmwood Village for the newly trendy West Side: owners Steve and Ellen Gedra set up shop in August of that year at the former '''Golden Key Tavern''' on Connecticut Street with a new name and a slightly revised concept. The newly rechristened Black Sheep builds on the pan-European eclecticism of The newly rechristened Black Sheep's former iteration with a menu that, while not much longer than '''Bistro Europa''''s, is even more wide-ranging and upscale than before (with prices to match). This expansion is a reflection of the expansion of The newly rechristened Black Sheep's staff, kitchen facilities, and above all, dining room: The newly rechristened Black Sheep seats about 70 people, more than double the old place, and the capacity is expanded further in the summer months thanks to a large, pleasant rear patio. As always, the accent here is on locally-sourced produce, meat, poultry, and dairy products, which figure into the smoked pork chop entree that comes with a side of heirloom grits and braised greens. As for appetizers, the cheese and charcuterie plates that were so popular at '''Bistro Europa''' are still on hand (courtesy of Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile'''), along with new innovations such as a sweet-and-savory watermelon gazpacho that comes with kaffir lime granita. You can also enjoy a selection of beers curated by '''Community Beer Works''' at a bar made of wood salvaged during the thorough restoration process that preceded The newly rechristened Black Sheep's opening."
"Left Bank has been the cornerstone of the Five Points dining scene since Left Bank's opening in 1992. Despite Left Bank's name and the local misconception, the menu here goes far beyond French food, instead encompassing an eclectic sampling of Continental, Italian, and New American dishes — in fact, Left Bank was one of the first restaurants in the city to embrace upscale cuisine of Continental, Italian, and New American dishes, hence Left Bank's enduring reputation as one of the city's most celebrated fine dining destinations. As well, the menu has remained remarkably static over that time — some locals even call the menu ""dated"" — but when you serve food this consistently good, why fix what's not broken? With portions that are big especially for a fine-dining establishment like Left Bank, the menu consists of a modest but high-quality range of appetizers and salads, a selection of small plates divided into rustic ""peasant fare"" (featuring the best fried calamari in the city) and more upscale ""bourgeois fare"" (the ahi tuna tartare is a particular standout), and a slate of creative and artful main courses of steak and chops, seafood dishes such as an out-of-this-world carrot papardelle tossed in a shellfish brandy cream with lobster, shrimp and crab, and a range of pasta dishes including a delightful chicken linguine with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. Left Bank also offers a changing selection of daily specials, as well as a wine list of encyclopedic proportions and impeccable quality; those who'd prefer to eat light have several delicious focaccia sandwiches to choose from. several delicious focaccia sandwiches to choose from is served in a chic, intimate ambience that's been described as ""arty meets industrial meets pub"". It bears emphasizing that Left Bank is a small place where reservations are ''de rigueur'' and Left Bank gets uncomfortably loud when crowded, so if it's warm, opt for the pleasant, gardenlike patio in back. Service can be slow, but Left Bank's always friendly; anyway, Left Bank is the kind of place where you want to linger. Off-street parking is available — a rarity in Left Bank."
"The September 2013 opening of this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' and most recently occupied by '''Prime 490''' steakhouse, was decidedly quiet. But this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' is the real deal. At the helm is chef/owner Josh Hanzlian, whose local credibility is beyond reproach: Hanzlian's stepfather is the late, great Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Martin, and another branch of Hanzlian's family owns '''Hanzlian's Homemade Sausage''' in Pine Hill. Hanzlian describes the cuisine served at this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' as a ""new American fusion"" where the focus is on tapas and small plates (though a small range of full-size mains is also available), and in a recent write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'' said Hanzlian ""want[s] this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland'''] to be a social experience"", hence this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''''s name. The food here consists of tried-and-true favorites with creative twists: nachos are topped with duck confit and lime-infused crème fraîche, sliders are made with ground lamb and boast a salsa of cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds, and the stuffed poblano peppers — arguably the most popular item on the menu — are filled with a mélange of aged cheeses and stone-cut oats, crusted with an olive panko breading, and served at dinner with a red pepper chipotle cream sauce and at brunch on Sundays with a side of eggs and toast. Indeed, reviewers reserve special praise for the Sunday brunch here, with $1 mimosas on offer. Appropriately enough for this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''', the ambience at this new restaurant in the Five Points district, originally home to '''Romanello's Roseland''' is pure gangland-era Art Deco, right down to the stylized lettering on the huge neon sign. The speakeasy decor continues indoors, complete with chandeliers, for a package that one reviewer describes as ""rival[ing] '''Left Bank''' in atmosphere both indoors and on the patio"" — yet a package that one reviewer describes as ""rival[ing] '''Left Bank''' in atmosphere both indoors and on the patio's refreshingly less crowded (for now) than that nearby hotspot. Service is friendly and attentive."
"Every Saturday morning during the winter months, the ground floor of '''Horsefeathers Market''' is transformed into a winter farmers' market where over twenty farmers and vendors from all across Western New York sell fresh produce and locally crafted artisanal food products — cookies, jams and jellies, even organic dog treats and local wine. Visitors can enjoy performances by local musicians as Visitors browse the market stands, or enjoy a bite to eat after shopping at permanent '''Horsefeathers Market''' tenants like '''Michelle's Caribbean Cuisine'''."
"One of the best-kept secrets in Black Rock, Angie's Pizza House is a friendly neighborhood hole-in-the-wall that dishes out cheap, delicious pizza and homestyle Italian fare in a handsome old brick block on Niagara Street. In the words of one reviewer, ""like the City of No Illusions [the City of No Illusions [itself], there's no pretense here""; rather, Angie's Pizza House's dated, spartan decor combines with friendly service to create true humble, homespun charm. The titular focus of the menu has a crust that's a good deal thinner than classic Buffalo-style pizza (though not foldable like New York pizza), and the pepperoni are the large, thinly-sliced kind you don't see too often here, but the sauce has the same sweetness you'll find elsewhere in the area. Pizza is only the beginning of the story at Angie's Pizza House's, though: the regulars rave about simple but reliable Italian favorites like ravioli, eggplant parm, and (especially) spaghetti with homemade meatballs and red sauce, and there are also hot and cold subs, more elaborate fare like steaks and chops, and a surprisingly competent chicken souvlaki entree. Hearty breakfasts are served weekdays, and Friday fish fry packs Angie's Pizza House. Cash only."
"Open for breakfast, lunch and (except Sunday) dinner, Emily's could be accurately described as a classic blue-collar Buffalo Greek diner, but that would be selling Emily's a bit short: for one, a small slate of Lebanese specialties including ''kofta'' over rice and homemade ''labneh'' are now served; and also, the food served here is a cut above what you'd expect from a humble place like Emily's. Emily's is a mom-and-pop place in the most literal sense of the term: Sam, the friendly, personable owner/chef who's frequently seen chatting up the regulars in the dining room, is joined on Emily's's staff by Sam, the friendly, personable owner/chef who's frequently seen chatting up the regulars in the dining room's wife Jocelyn, the sole waitress whose service is second to none. In a delightfully dated ambience is served a host of hearty, homestyle American fare like meatloaf, liver and onions, and porkchops; sandwiches, burgers, and wraps (including that old-school Buffalo standby, fried bologna); and — of course — all your favorite Greek diner standards such as souvlaki and gyro, served either ""open"" or as full-size entrees with a side of potatoes prepared how you like them. Souvlaki permutations also populate the breakfast menu, which otherwise consists of hearty egg-and-sausage fare as well as delicious homemade pancakes. All the food is delicious, homemade, and served with old-fashioned aplomb. A public lot is conveniently located across the street as an alternative to parallel parking on Hertel Avenue."
"No surprises at this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014. There are a few token concessions to local particularities — Texas hots available alongside regular hot dogs; souvlaki chicken and feta cheese among the ingredient selections in the ""build-your-own"" omelette — but by and large, this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014's sticks to the tried-and-true formula of classic American diner fare and does so with aplomb. The burgers, sandwiches, and copious breakfast options are reliably good and available at great prices. Service is efficient, the interior is sparkling clean and decorated in a pleasant if spartan aesthetic — one online review of this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014 included the sentence ""If an alien visited Earth and asked 'what's a diner?' this is exactly where I would take them"", and that's about as accurate and succinct a review of this brand-new breakfast and lunch place that opened in Black Rock in 2014's as you'll ever find."
"Riverside Café is a friendly, homey greasy spoon (actually, that's probably not the right term to use — Riverside Café is spic and span!) in the heart of the neighborhood of Riverside Café, serving breakfast and lunch daily with several changing specials available each day. ""Local"" is the operative word here — Riverside Café's lunch menu features a rogue's gallery of Buffalo specialties like beef on weck, Texas hots, and fried bologna sandwiches made with locally-produced '''Sahlen's''' frankfurters, '''Mineo & Sapio''' Italian sausage, and '''Costanzo's''' rolls. Sandwiches are king at lunchtime — the slate of single- and double-decker concoctions include a delectable Monte Cristo made with either turkey or corned beef — and some interesting burgers are available too, all made with 100% Angus beef patties; some interesting burgers include a ""Buffalo-style burger"" (topped with a mix of blue cheese dressing and '''Frank's''' hot sauce) and a doughnut burger (exactly what it sounds like: a glazed doughnut replaces the bun). A decent selection of homemade soups are also available to go with. But Riverside Café may be even more popular at breakfast, with a gargantuan menu that ranges from the usual permutations of the eggs-toast-sausage-bacon template to more specialized dishes like a pepperoni and salsa omelette and flaky homemade biscuits topped with sausage gravy. Additionally, Riverside Café is open into dinnertime on Fridays and Saturdays, when locals pack the house to enjoy delicious fish fry — another local favorite. Service here earns mixed reviews; Service here's quick and efficient but sometimes not so friendly."
"In 2015, Acqua changed the game: that's when the waterfront eatery at the former site of '''Harry's Harbour Place'''  launched a new ""casual menu"", boasting lower prices and a more laid-back atmosphere to go with the breathtaking views over the Niagara River. Seafood rules the day among Acqua's main courses — not surprisingly — but a new ""casual menu"", boasting lower prices and a more laid-back atmosphere to go with the breathtaking views over the Niagara River adds interesting Asian influences to the mix, including an interesting noodle bowl with shredded chicken and peanut sesame sauce."
"Buffalo Supper Club's owners, Aaron Osborne and Christopher Williams, started with a vision: what if the Black Rock dining scene were more than just pizzerias, fast-food joints and greasy spoons? What if, instead, you could come to the uppermost reaches of the West Side for a real night on the town, with fine dining at a stylish, upscale sit-down restaurant? Flash forward to October 2014, when Buffalo Supper Club's opened Buffalo Supper Club's's doors on Niagara Street. Buffalo Supper Club's owners, Aaron Osborne and Christopher Williams promised that ""when you walk in here, you won't think you're in Black Rock; you'll think you're somewhere on Delaware or Elmwood"", and despite Buffalo Supper Club's's unassuming look from the outside, all is as promised — the dining room makes up for in style and snazz what the dining room lakes in size, with a sleek, minimalist decor, all-black furniture (including a comfy ''chaise longue''!), an electric fireplace, a vintage-style jukebox, and a lively bar serving up a mix of big-name domestic and imported beers as well as local craft brews. Best of all, without skimping on quality, Buffalo Supper Club's's food comes at prices that won't break the bank: nothing on the menu costs more than $30. the Buffalo Supper Club's food scores few points for creativity; instead, the Buffalo Supper Club's food offers well-executed takes on familiar favorites such as steak, a range of chicken and seafood mains, classic Buffalo-style fish fry, burgers (the ""Buffalo Supper Club's Blues Burger"", featuring one beef and one chicken patty topped with bacon, American and crumbly blue cheese is a particularly interesting option), and on the appetizers menu, chicken wings that come in Buffalo style, barbeque or your choice of specialty sauces."
"A surprise is in store for hungry Black Rockers who peruse Faso's unassuming, shopworn exterior and expect yet another round of uninspired red-sauce Italian. It's true that Faso's is a small family operation located in a blue-collar neighborhood, and from the prices on the menu you wouldn't think you're in for anything remarkable. But Faso's's is run by a real Italian — ""actually from Italy, not an nth generation [Italian-American who doesn't] know any Italian except throwing 'paisan' into conversation"", says one reviewer — whose authentic food boasts nuanced flavors and textures not typical of Americanized Italian food. Start by walking into a dining room that's much larger than Faso's looks from the outside and doesn't seem to know whether Faso's wants to be highbrow or lowbrow — delightfully tawdry decorative elements like colored Christmas lights (up all year), dangly baubles, framed portraits of the Rat Pack, and plaster Virgin Mary sculptures coexist with low lighting and soft Italian music on the speakers. Then, while munching on the most heavenly bread knots that have ever melted in your mouth, peruse menu options that range from well-known standards to more obscure dishes that are hard to find in these parts; this ""food so good you'll think we stole your mama"" is light, healthful, and prepared with fresh ingredients. Faso's's pasta is scratch-made in house, the ""best seafood menu on the Buffalo Harbor"" includes shrimp fra' diavolo, swordfish steak Italiano, and scallops cooked any way you like, fine steaks and chops abound, and sandwiches and the like are on offer for those who want portions smaller than the heaping ones you otherwise get. Service is uncommonly warm and friendly — the owner is known for greeting customers personally with an impeccable, old-world tableside manner — but can be slow if the place is crowded."
"Yet another addition to the roster of options on the West Side for fans of Burmese cuisine, this place is run by the same folks who operate '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street (and, in tandem with the December 2014 opening of '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street, the same folks who operate '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street also inaugurated a second grocery store location next door). In reality, Thai dishes comprise more than half of the options on '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street's menu: mostly the standard lineup of curries, fried rice, and noodle dishes available with chicken, beef, pork, or seafood, but with a few surprises mixed in if you look. However, it's in the Burmese options where '''Lin Asian Market''' on Grant Street's cooks really strut Lin's cooks's stuff in terms of creativity and authenticity: savory ''samosas'' are the star of the show in the appetizers department, ''le peth thoat'' tea leaf salad is present in a version that rivals the one at '''Sun''', and ''mohinga'' is made the authentic Burmese way. Copious options are available for vegans and the gluten-free crowd, but those who like spicy food might not be quite satisfied with the preparation here (for best results, have those who like spicy food make your food ""Thai hot""). Service is friendly as can be and carefully walks the line between attentive and annoyingly obtrusive, and the pleasant if minimalist decor looks as if a spartan selection of Asian restaurant accoutrements (silver elephant engravings and the like) were grafted onto the template of a homestyle country diner, with walls painted pink and covered with charming wainscoting around the bottom."
"The Buffalo dining scene has come a long way since 2010, when Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur, felt compelled to lump the delicious specialties of Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur's native Myanmar under the ""Vietnamese"" section of Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur's restaurant's menu because Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur was unsure how locals would take to the delicious specialties of his native Myanmar. Kevin Lin, a '''Wegmans''' sushi chef turned upstart restaurateur needn't have worried — Buffalonians practically beat down the door at Sun, and even if Sun can't hold a candle to the West Side Bazaar's '''Kyel Sein Hein''' in terms of authenticity, Sun's still the only game in town if you want a full menu of Burmese food served in an actual, full-service restaurant setting. The ""full menu"" part bears repeating — the range of offerings at Sun is gargantuan, with a menu broken down into Burmese (labeled as such), Thai, and Asian fusion sections featuring tantalizing appetizers and salads, curries, rice and noodle dishes, and soups. Diners also love Sun's ""black rice menu"", a range of sushi rolls, salads and desserts prepared using a rare and nutritious variety of rice once reserved for the elites of the Chinese imperial court — and although in this author's opinion it's way overhyped, locals rave about the pickled tea leaf salad (''le peth thoat'') which is Sun's specialty. For newbies, the helpful waitstaff are always happy to walk you through the menu, explaining each dish in detail. On the minus side, Sun's food is pricey especially when you consider the unimpressive size of Sun's food's portions, and service is often slow especially when Sun's food's crowded."
"The Viking Lobster Company is a classic case of ""don't judge a book by a book's cover"": hidden inside a somewhat shabby-looking building that could pass for one of the houses on the side street next to a somewhat shabby-looking building that could pass for one of the houses on the side street next to it is arguably the finest restaurant in Black Rock. The menu here is modest in size, but covers all the bases for seafood lovers — shrimp, scallops, broiled salmon and haddock filets, king crab legs, and, of course, myriad permutations of lobster — and also makes room for a few interesting innovations, such as steak-stuffed lobster and a creative take on paella. Prices may seem high at first glance, but it's justified by the impeccable quality of the food — the food's shipped directly from processors on the North Atlantic coast for maximum freshness, and The Viking Lobster Company also has the largest live-lobster holding pens in Upstate New York. For those who don't like seafood, a modest range of steaks, ribs, and roasted chicken dishes are served; a modest range of steaks, ribs, and roasted chicken dishes also tend to be lower in price than the rest of the menu. Sides such as soups, salads and bread are all prepared daily in-house. At The Viking Lobster Company, service is friendly and attentive, the vibe is relaxed, portion sizes are ample, and the interior is cool without trying to be — pretense is eschewed in favor of what one reviewer describes as a ""quirky at-the-wharf kind of feel"". In summer, the patio (which features a raw bar and outdoor grill) is the place to be. Reservations are required. Cash only, but there's an ATM onsite."
"The West Side's newest craft brewery boasts a German-style outdoor beer garden featuring homemade brews and light snacks, as well as bocce courts and a fire pit. In the winter, The West Side's newest craft brewery moves indoors to an indoor tap room with ample views over The West Side's newest craft brewery."
"Organic cold-pressed juices and smoothies, as well as coffee."
"Laundry and dry cleaning."
"All Saints Catholic Church was founded by Bishop Charles Colton to serve the largely Irish population of the then-new neighborhood of Riverside. The present building — the third to house All Saints Catholic Church — is a handsome Colonial edifice dedicated in 1937 and home to a ""Mighty Wurlitzer"" organ donated by famous hotelier and local native son Ellsworth Statler. All Saints Catholic Church remains a robust congregation headed by longtime pastor Angelo Chimera."
"With the completion of the New York Central Railroad's Belt Line in 1883, the eastern outskirts of Black Rock began to develop into Buffalo's second Polish neighborhood — a sort of little brother to Broadway-Fillmore — and Assumption Church, headed at the outset by the Rev. Theophil Kozlowski, was Buffalo's second Polish neighborhood — a sort of little brother to Broadway-Fillmore —'s nucleus. The current church, a majestic ""Polish Cathedral style"" edifice built in 1914 to a design by the local firm of Schmill & Gould, is still a fairly active one of about 2,500 registered members."
"Located on the Upper West Side, Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is where the Reverend Peter Hai Nguyen says Mass to Buffalo's Vietnamese immigrant community."
"Located in Prospect Hill, Holy Angels is one of the oldest Catholic churches in Buffalo, founded in 1859 in what was then a middle-class Irish community on the outskirts of Buffalo by Bishop John Timon, in conjunction with several Oblate Fathers from Marseille. The addition in 1874 of the transept, sanctuary, and choir completed Holy Angels to Holy Angels's present appearance. Holy Angels has been a West Side anchor in the midst of the myriad changes that have taken place since then — neighborhood demographics have shifted from Irish to Italian to Hispanic (one Spanish-language Mass is still said every Sunday) to a multicultural pastiche, and Holy Angels is now an island in the middle of the greatly expanded '''D'Youville College''' — but the friendly and welcoming church community, 1,400 families strong, soldiers on."
"Holy Cross was founded in tandem with the growth of the Italian community in Holy Cross's surrounding neighborhood, and has managed to remain a vital cornerstone of the Lower West Side despite the great changes that have taken place there over the century of Holy Cross's existence. Holy Cross is a congregation that is vibrant and multicultural, but largely Hispanic, and Mass is said in both languages. True to the Italian tradition, the interior of Holy Cross is bedecked with scores of statues of the Madonna, many of which were brought over by the original parishioners from the old country."
"Our Lady of Hope is the West Side's newest Catholic church, founded in 2009 as a merger of Annunciation (in whose handsome Gothic edifice the current congregation worships), Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and Our Lady of Loretto parishes. Here, with the help of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the Rev. Mitch Byeck ministers to a congregation that's ever-growing in size and diversity."
"The former '''First Hungarian Baptist Church''' — a humble yet handsome wood-frame building on Austin Street in Grant-Amherst erected in 1912 as one of the few surviving works of local architect John Coxhead — has been reborn as the home to an ""independent, fundamental, Bible-believing, soul-winning, compassionate gospel-preaching Baptist church"" where the imposing Pastor Pete Wigdor offers old-fashioned, plainspoken solutions to the real problems of modern-day people. Charity Baptist Church's dedication to community outreach is exemplified not only in the Sunday morning services where regulars and visitors alike are welcomed with open arms, but with programs such as a weekly ""Movie Night"", a community food pantry, and occasional special events."
"As First United Methodist's name indicates, First United Methodist is the oldest congregation of First United Methodist's denomination in Buffalo, and one of the oldest, period — First United Methodist was founded in 1819 in what was then the Village of Black Rock by the Reverend Glezen Fillmore, an itinerant frontier preacher who, besides being a cousin of President Millard Fillmore, was New York State's first Methodist minister west of the Genesee River. First United Methodist moved to First United Methodist's current location in 1912, where Pastor Scott Lamont Johnson continues to lead weekly services for a small but vibrant and welcoming flock. If nothing else, the building itself is reason enough to come: the building itself's a handsome English Gothic design in rough-cut limestone that's the work of architect John Coxhead, with an austere but lovely skylit interior."
"With an innovative and community-based approach to ministry, Grace Community Church is a multiethnic Wesleyan congregation that seeks to ""put the neighbor back in the 'hood"". At the ""House of Grace"" on Potomac Avenue on the Upper West Side, Pastor Casper ""Cap"" Farrow not only preaches the word to Pastor Casper ""Cap"" Farrow's own flock, but also teams up with three other congregations to steward a wide gamut of community outreach programs."
"Nazareth Lutheran Church has been a steadfast presence in Riverside almost since the dawn of Riverside's history: Nazareth Lutheran Church's been located on the same site since Nazareth Lutheran Church was founded in 1914 as a mission of '''Calvary Lutheran Church''' in Cold Spring, and Nazareth Lutheran Church's current building — a charming little red-brick church in a simplified English Gothic style, with stained-glass windows from '''Pike Studio''' in Rochester — was erected in 1949. Today, Nazareth Lutheran Church remains a friendly and welcoming congregation headed up by Pastor Dwayne Hendricks and affiliated with the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church. Nazareth Lutheran Church also does double duty as home of the '''Boys' & Girls' Clubs of the Northtowns''', a testament to Nazareth Lutheran Church's commitment to community betterment."
"Founded in 1891 as a mission of the '''Richmond Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church''', the Ontario Street United Methodist Church is a community linchpin whose humble but handsome 1914 edifice has been spruced up with a community garden, learning center, meeting space for neighborhood improvement programs, and other resources for Riverside residents. Best of all, pastor Nathan Lange, who also does double duty as leader of Trinity Methodist Church in Grand Island, maintains a friendly, open congregation that receives visitors with the utmost hospitality."

"The poshest cafe in Alexandria, famed for the best ''om ali'' in Egypt &mdash; although LE 14 for what is essentially a bowl of sweet cornflour pudding is little steep. The food is also good and slightly more reasonably priced, try the moussaka for LE 13."
"A nice place to visit, friendly staff, tasty food and drinks with an average price of LE 15 for an average meal and LE 8 for beverages. Shisha is available at the garden of A nice place to visit. Free WIFI."
"Built in 1922, Delices' flagship store in Ramleh Station in Alexandria, Egypt has become a well-known landmark for all tourists and local residents wanting to experience the beauty of the Cosmopolitan era. Delices' flagship store in Ramleh Station in Alexandria, Egypt is still managed by the same Family since 1922! Famous for Delices' flagship store in Ramleh Station in Alexandria, Egypt's Cassata (ice cream) and Greek Baklava (similar to Egyptian Baklawa but dripped with cinnamon and honey)"
"Alegria is the newest hip Restaurant/ Lounge in Alexandria. Pre-reservation is a must and can only be done by Alegria's customers on Alegria's selected guest list. On a regular around 400 people show up. Alegria can be booked for private parties, birthdays, cocktails, receptions and small occasions. Many of Alexandria's wealthy and famous show up to Alegria."
"Live Music, Famous Singers, Oriental Dancers, and World Famous show stars"
"Hotel Azur - Downstairs. Named after the Canadian city, the Canadian city is a nightclub which offers food and drinks. Drinks go from 25 LE to 50 LE. Watch your bill as Drinks may add a few extra items. If not, Drinks will ask for ""additional"" tips."
"This hotel is extremely run down and the floor is not well cleaned but the price and location is good."
"Cheap but a little dirty hotel located in downtown. The single room including bathroom, A/C and breakfast costs €12/$20 per night. Rooms could be cleaner, but are adequate given the budget price. Breakfast is simple but enough. Friendly and helpful staff."
"Suitable for the budget traveler. The rooms could be cleaner, but are adequate given the budget price. The bathrooms are shared. Breakfast (croissant, rolls/jam, boiled egg, and coffee) is included. There is a sitting area with tables and a view of the water and Qaitbay. It is not possible to book the hotel online. You need to either reserve by phone or in person. The top story room overlooking the sea  is magnificent. However bathrooms are not cleaned to Western standards. Also, at least one traveller reported that the breakfast cutlery was not clean."
"The Normandy hotel is an excellent place to stay. The Normandy hotel is a one floor hotel located on the Corniche, with unbeatable views of the city's Eastern Harbor. The Normandy hotel is the building behind the famous Cecil Hotel, on the fourth floor. Rooms range from 15LE to 30LE per night, depending on availability, view, and season. The rooms are well-appointed, large and clean, but spare. The bathrooms are down the hall, and also clean. Staff are very friendly, helpful, and honest. Staff speak both English and Arabic, with limited knowledge of a few other random languages."
"A no-frills two-star hotel with private bathrooms and hot water, popular with overland trucks setting off down into the heart of Africa. Not far from the shore and within walking distance from the center of town. Watch out for bedbugs."
"Modern concrete block with 63 rooms, some overlooking the sea. Aircon, cable TV. Not far from the Alexandria Library."
"Housed in the vast grounds of the Montazah Palace, this hotel was built as a lodge for the guests of Khedive Abbas Helmi II in 1892. Now a five-star hotel and casino, the setting certainly is opulent but, for the price tag, service seems to be terrible. The location in the vast, gated grounds at the far eastern end of the city, 10 km from the center, is also quite inconvenient for sightseeing, but if you're looking for peace and quiet (always a rare commodity in Egypt), this is the place."
"Edging the Mediterranean in a setting of legendary glamour, discover an intimate enclave within the stately Grand Plaza shopping and residential complex. Indulge in classically elegant accommodations, European spa treatments and terraced restaurants with fresh sea breezes. Four Seasons care outshines all else in Alexandria. Alexandria's top hotel and priced to match."
"The hotel, most recently refurbished in 2002, is set on the Mediterranean Sea and is surrounded by 350 acres of gardens and beaches. The hotel, most recently refurbished in 2002 faces the Montaza Royal Palace, once home to the royal family."
"Officially only a three-star hotel, but much better than you'd expect in this class."
"Opened in 1902, this is one of Alexandria's two grand old hotels. Recently given a half-hearted renovation, still keeping the turn-of-the-century style. Centrally located on Alexandria's's main street, which is handy for sightseeing, but lower floor rooms (esp. those facing the back) can be very noisy. Internet is available but can be spotty."
"The new hotel will provide 158 stylish renovated guest rooms and suites , excellent dining, 1000 square meters of meeting facilities and a selection of new restaurants and lounges. Additional amenities include an open air pool, 24 hours full service fitness center, private beach, business center, gift shop and laundry."
"Located on the far (eastern) end of the Corniche. Small, shabby and in need of renovation."
"Alexandria's other grand old hotel, many of whose rooms are named after famous guests like Agatha Christie and Winston Churchill. If you're looking for historical character and a central location, the Cecil is not a bad pick, and the soundproofing is somewhat better than at Alexandria's. Downsides: No Internet, hard beds, and ludicrously slow service in the restaurants."
"Located up against the water in the half-abandoned Alex West district. The hotel is far from the main city and rather badly maintained."
"A small, friendly Dive Centre at the quieter end of Na'ama Bay offering daily diving and all PADI courses - discounts for internet bookings."
"PADI five star diving centres offering daily diving trips, PADI courses, and liveaboard safaris."
"Helpful personnel. Require helmets (provided); several pairs of riding boots available. After the ride, offer you to give showers to your horse. Bambi and Kelly are declared as the fastest horses. Too far from the desert: in 2-hours route, only 40 minutes is actual ride in the desert, the remainder time is spent to get there and to return back. For 2 hours, better choose stables at the edge of the desert."
"Sold by many agencies. Groups are 10-15 bikes; two persons per bike is allowed (although bikes are originally designed for a single person). Tasting Berber tea is very risky for your stomach--proven several times. Group is accompanied by a car with camcorder--video is not worth buying, and a car with camcorder generates much extra dust (you can't do much about it unless your whole group ask in advance to not make video at all)."
"one of the classic European shops with price tags, option to pay with credit card without disadvantages, exchange machine and ATM inside.  They do have a lot of local spices and even some souvenir items, like small papyrus just for 2 LE."
"Offering the finest Egyptian barbeque cuisine including Kabab, Kofta, Reyash, Nefa, Tarab & liver, all types of oriental dishes including veal shank, stuffed pigeon & stuffed duck, all types of pasta & rice & different types of stuffed vegetables. Alcohol free. Enjoy all types of grills. Also worth is GAD a few more doors down, look for the big red sign. Both are full of locals."
"All kinds of seafood fresh from the Red Sea."
"Lebanese cuisine. Good place for waterpipes; order a smaller one (Fawanes); apple one is ideal."
"Fusion food, good services and reasonable prices."
"Probably one of the best fish cafes in the town. A rare place where grilled calmaras are really good. However, the lobster included in the mixed seafood plate is dry."
"Features some percentage of locals. Waiters are uniformed in distinctive orange-and-green. Waterpipe is good, but when served for several people (with many hoses), the menu price may be multiplied by number of people--ask in advance; maybe Waterpipe's just a scam."
"There are 3 Indian restaurants in Sharm. One is Maharaja, on the beach pathway. Other two are India House Restaurants, of Thai Chain hotels. One is the old market and another one, opposite little Buddha, on the road near Taxi stand. Can get Indian menus."
"Second famous venue after Pacha club. Presumably owned by Russians and avoided by everyone ."
"Good music and cocktails. Not the cheapest place in town."
"One of the most famous dancing clubs."
"The hotel proudly boasts and features the only 18-hole PGA international championship golf course in the entire area (Winner of the Platinum MENA Travel Award for Best Golf Club in the Middle East & Africa in 2006)."
"Small, independent hotel situated right on the beach at the quieter end of Na'ama Bay.  With integrated restaurant and bar facilities, roof bar and on-site Dive Centre.  Friendly staff and personal service."
"Extremely spacious and modern rooms."
"Very small territory for its number of visitors. Airport is very close, and planes fly over the hotel's territory."
"Large territory is isolated and private, but still within walking distance from Naama Bay--allowing pleasant promenades through a flower alley for a dinner in Naama Bay. Moroccan-style interior and territory decoration; territory smothered in flowers. Very courteous staff--compared to many other resorts of this grade in Sharm. Built around late 80s-early 90s, as bathrooms equipment suggests; plastic chairs on most private terraces. Large swimming pool, tennis court (pay for electric light only?), gym, horse stables available. 3 private beaches, each with a private piece of a coral reef right near the beach. Breakfast is from 6:30AM-10:30AM; buffet is not refilled after 10AM. Good choice of traditional breakfast meals; custom-made omlettes and fried eggs; coffee is American only; cocoa is made of instant. Whole fruits are not served, but all components for fruit salad are.  The Horizon Bar overlooks the sea; terraces next to the pool both serve dishes from the main restaurant where the breakfast is served. Caesar salad is fine; lentil soup is not spicy and pretty good (if you like lentil soup). Pizzas are quite rubbery. Cucumber soup cold and strange. There's also an Indian restaurant."
"About ten minutes from the airport."
"Guestrooms have balconies, air conditioning, and sofa beds.  Rooms also include minibars and handheld showers."
"5 star resort style hotel with 439 rooms and suites, a watersports centre and a spa."
"It has been built in traditional Roman Style. It is not on the beach but has a free shuttle bus. They charge €3 per hour for wifi."
"Spa, diving and snorkelling from the hotel."
"Spa, diving and snorkelling from the hotel."
"az Mirabel Beach offers stunning views of the Red Sea in a luxurious but relaxed family-friendly setting for the perfect Egypt holidays package. az Mirabel Beach lies on the shores of a lagoon in Nabq Bay, a ten-minute drive from Sharm El-Sheikh International Airport."
